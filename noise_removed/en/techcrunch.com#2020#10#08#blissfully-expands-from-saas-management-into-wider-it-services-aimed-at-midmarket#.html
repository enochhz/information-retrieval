Blissfully expands from SaaS management into wider IT services aimed at midmarket 
20 hours 
When launched in 2016, it was focused on helping companies understand their SaaS usage inside their organizations, but over time the company has seen that there is a wider need, especially in midmarket companies, and today it announced it was expanding into broader IT management. 
Company co-founder and CEO says that the startup began helping to track SaaS usage, eventually expanding into employee onboarding and exiting, and today they are expanding into a broader set of IT services. 
 "Our vision when starting a company was really that IT is being redefined in the age of SaaS. So step one was to help with everything around managing SaaS. And step two is what does that mean in terms of the broader IT management vision," Diaz told TechCrunch. 
believed that SaaS was going to take a bigger and bigger part of IT in terms of mindshare, spend and how you manage it, and they turned out to be right. Now, they felt the time is right to expand their original idea to encompass more of the IT management function. 
That has resulted in a newly expanded platform they are releasing today that not only includes the earlier SaaS management components that it's been providing all along, but also four other new categories. 
For starters they are offering IT asset management. "We are now offering the ability to track not just SaaS applications, but all your IT assets, including hardware devices and traditional software," Diaz said. 
Next, they are including help desk management and ticketing capabilities to handle requests that fall outside of their SaaS management workflows. In addition, they are adding role-based access control to allow different people access to various IT management services, which is increasingly essential during the pandemic as people are being forced to troubleshoot and manage various IT issues from home. Finally, the startup is opening up its APIs so that IT can tap into that and build customized functionality or workflows on top of the Blissfully platform. 
Diaz believes that the company has reached a point of maturity when it comes to SaaS management, and they saw a need in the midmarket to provide these additional IT services that larger organizations tend to get from a company like ServiceNow. 
The new services will be available starting today from Blissfully.
