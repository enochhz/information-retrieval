Or, 
When you view a repository while signed in to your account, the URLs you can use to clone the project onto your computer are available below the repository details: 
For information on setting or changing your remote URL, see``.`` 
The 
https:// 
clone URLs are available on all repositories, public and private. These URLs work even if you are behind a firewall or proxy. 
When you 
git clone 
, 
git fetch 
, 
git pull 
, or 
git push 
to a remote repository using HTTPS URLs on the command line, Git will ask for your GitHub username and password. Password-based authentication for Git is deprecated, and we recommend using a personal access token( PAT) when prompted for a password instead, which is more secure. Treat your token just like a password. For more information, see``.`` 
If you are accessing an organization that uses SAML SSO, you must also authorize your personal access token to access the organization before you authenticate. For more information, see``'' and``.`` 
Tips 
: 
You can use a credential helper so Git will remember your GitHub credentials every time it talks to GitHub. For more information, see``.`` 
To clone a repository without authenticating to GitHub on the command line, you can use GitHub Desktop to clone instead. For more information, see``.`` 
If you'd rather use SSH but can not connect over port 22, you might be able to use SSH over the HTTPS port. For more information, see``.`` 
SSH URLs provide access to a Git repository via SSH, a secure protocol. To use these URLs, you must generate an SSH keypair on your computer and add the 
public 
key to your GitHub account. For more information, see``.`` 
When you 
git clone 
, 
git fetch 
, 
git pull 
, or 
git push 
to a remote repository using SSH URLs, you 'll be prompted for a password and must provide your SSH key passphrase. For more information, see``.`` 
If you are accessing an organization that uses SAML single sign-on( SSO), you must authorize your SSH key to access the organization before you authenticate. For more information, see``'' and``.`` 
Tip 
: You can use an SSH URL to clone a repository to your computer, or as a secure way of deploying your code to production servers. You can also use SSH agent forwarding with your deploy script to avoid managing keys on the server. For more information, see``.`` 
You can also install GitHub CLI to use GitHub workflows in your terminal. For more information, the documentation. 
You can also use a client to access any repository on GitHub. Subversion offers a different feature set than Git. For more information, see``'' 
You can also access repositories on GitHub from Subversion clients. For more information, see``.``
