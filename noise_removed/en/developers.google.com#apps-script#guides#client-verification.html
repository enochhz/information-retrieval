Google OAuth clients that request certain sensitive OAuth scopes are subject to verification by Google. 
Note: 
Verification is 
not required 
for Apps Script projects whose owner and users belong to the same Google Workspace domain or customer. 
If you do n't verify your script project's OAuth client, users outside your domain see an 
unverified app 
screen when they try to authorize your script. An 
unverified authorization flow 
allows these users to authorize unverified apps and use them, but only after confirming they understand the risks. The total number of unverified app users is also capped. 
For more information, see the following articles: 
Figure 1 
: Unverified app screen 
Figure 2 
: Unverified app authorization flow 
This change applies to Google OAuth web clients, including those used by all Apps Script projects. By, you can remove the unverified app screen from your authorization flow and give your users confidence that your app is non-malicious. 
Unverified apps 
Add-ons, web apps, and other deployments( such as apps that use the) may need verification. 
Note: 
Add-ons are no longer verified as part of the, and must be verified prior to publishing an add-on. 
Applicability 
If the app uses sensitive OAuth scopes, the unverified app screen may appear as part of the authorization flow. Its presence( and the resulting unverified app authorization flow) depends on what account the app is published from and what account is attempting to use the app. For example, apps published in a specific Google Workspace organization do not result in the unverified app authorization flow for accounts in that domain, even if the app has not been verified. 
The following table illustrates what situations result in the unverified app authorization flow: 
Client is verified 
Publisher is a Google Workspace account of customer A 
Script is in a shared drive of customer A 
Publisher is a Gmail account 
User is a Google Workspace account of customer A

User cap 
The number of users who can authorize an app via the unverified app flow is capped to limit possible abuse. See for details. 
Requesting verification 
You can request a verification of the OAuth client used by your app and its associated. Once your app is verified, your users will no longer see the unverified app screen. In addition, your app will no longer be subject to the. 
Requirements 
In order to submit your OAuth client for verification, you must satisfy the following requirements: 
You must own a web site on a domain. The site must host publicly-accessible pages that describe your app and its privacy policy. You must also. 
Note: 
You do not need to publish your app from an account in this domain, but the domain owner must be an editor or owner of the script project. 
The your script project uses must be a that you have edit access for. If your script is using its default GCP project, you must. 
In addition, you must have the following 
required 
assets: 
Application name 
. The name of the app; this is displayed on the consent screen. It should match the name used for the app in other locations, such as the listing for published apps. 
Application logo 
. A app logo JPEG, PNG, or BMP image to use in the consent screen. Its file size must be 1MB or less. 
Support email 
. This is an email displayed on the consent screen for users to contact if they need app support. It can be your email address or a Google Group that you own or manage. 
Scopes 
. The list of all the your app uses. You can in the Apps Script editor. 
Authorized domains 
. This is a whitelist of domains containing information about your app. All your application's links( such as its required privacy policy page) must be hosted on authorized domains. 
Application homepage URL 
. The location of a homepage describing your app. This location must hosted on an authorized domain. 
Application privacy policy URL 
. The location of a page describing your app's privacy policy. This location must be hosted on an authorized domain. 
In addition to the above required assets, you can optionally provide an 
Application terms of service URL 
that points to a page describing your app's terms of service. If provided, this location must be in an authorized domain. 
Steps 
If you have not done so already, you use to host your script project's privacy policy and other information. The verified owners of the domains must be editors or the owner of the script project. 
In the Apps Script editor, select 
File& gt; Project properties& gt; Scopes 
. Copy all the scopes your script project uses. 
using the text and URL assets you collected. 
Be sure to list all the 
Authorized domains 
where your app's information( such as its privacy policy) are hosted. 
To add your application scopes, click the 
Add scope 
button. The resulting dialog attempts to autodetect scopes for APIs you 've enabled in the Cloud Platform( such as). You can select scopes from this list by checking the corresponding checkboxes. 
This autodetected list does n't always include scopes used by Apps Script. You must enter these scopes manually by clicking the 
manually paste 
link and then entering the scopes in the resulting checkbox. 
When you are done selecting or entering scopes, click 
Add 
. 
When you 've entered all the required information, click 
Save 
. 
Click 
Submit for verification 
to start a verification request. 
Most verification requests receive a response within 24 to 72 hours. You can check the 
Verification status 
at the top of the OAuth consent screen form. When verification of your OAuth client is confirmed, your app is verified. 
Note: 
If your app is verified and later you decide to, you must repeat these steps to keep the app verified.
