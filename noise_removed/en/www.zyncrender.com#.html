About Zync 
Two things continue to be true in visual effects and rendering projects: schedules fluctuate, and the effort to get to final remains impossible to predict. This is where Zync was born: from the rendering pipelines of real studios, enabling small creative teams to focus on creativity rather than infrastructure. 
Using native plugins to animation tools artists are already familiar with like,,, and, to built-in licensing for today's most powerful rendering software, Zync lets studios burst their rendering to the cloud when they need it most. Zync has been the go-to rendering solutions for over a dozen feature films and hundreds of commercials, totaling over 50 million core rendering hours.
