If is called 
libxml_disable_entity_loader( true); 
, it causes that new SoapClient(.) fails with 
SOAP-ERROR: Parsing WSDL: Could n't load from'D: \path/dm_operations.wsdl': failed to load external entity`` D: \path/dm_operations.wsdl 
because this wsdl imports a xsd as an another external file. 
Tested on php 7.1.12, win x64.

Using this function you can prevent a vulnerable to Local and Remote File Inclusion attacks. 
You 'll see it in an example where I load and validate the following string: 
& lt;! DOCTYPE scan[& lt;! ENTITY test SYSTEM`` php: //filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=/etc/passwd''& gt;]& gt; 
& lt; scan& gt;& amp; test;& lt; /scan& gt; 
One way to prevent that the file in given back is to set this value to0. 
Please take a closer look at the release of symfony 2.0.11

Be mindful that this also disables url loading in simplexml_load_file() and likely other libxml based functions that deal with URLs

This also seems to have an impact on& lt; xsl: import/& gt; statements if this is applied when loading XSLT for the XSLTProcessor class.

This function was reported to be not thread safe. So this might affect php-scripts on the same server.
