G Suite is now Google Workspace. Everything you need to get anything done, now in one place. We 're planning to roll out Google Workspace to education and nonprofits over time. 
Restore a recently deleted user 
You can restore a user account( including administrator accounts) up to 20 days after deleting it. After 20 days, the data is gone and ca n't restore it, either. See. 
Access to the user's previous service 
If you only have one Google service, restoring a user automatically reactivates access for the user. 
If you have more than one service, the user's access is automatically restored for those services they had a license for—assuming you had automatic license assignment turned on for that service. See. 
Otherwise, you need to manually reassign a license for a service to the user. See. 
Archived User licenses 
—If the user had an Archived User( AU) license, you need to manually reassign that license to ensure that the user's data and policies are appropriately restored. Read. 
G Suite and GCP 
—For G Suite, when the user's license is restored automatically or manually, the user gets back all access to their Google Cloud Platform permissions and email, calendars, and other G Suite data.
