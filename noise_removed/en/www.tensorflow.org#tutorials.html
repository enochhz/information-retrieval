For beginners 
The best place to start is with the user-friendly Keras sequential API. Build models by plugging together building blocks. After these tutorials, read the. 
This`` Hello, World!'' notebook shows the Keras Sequential API and 
model.fit 
. 
This notebook collection demonstrates basic machine learning tasks using Keras. 
These tutorials use 
tf.data 
to load various data formats and build input pipelines. 
For experts 
The Keras functional and subclassing APIs provide a define-by-run interface for customization and advanced research. Build your model, then write the forward and backward pass. Create custom layers, activations, and training loops. 
This`` Hello, World!'' notebook uses the Keras subclassing API and a custom training loop. 
This notebook collection shows how to build custom layers and training loops in TensorFlow. 
Distribute your model training across multiple GPUs, multiple machines or TPUs.
