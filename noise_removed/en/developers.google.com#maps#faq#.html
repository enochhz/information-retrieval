To learn more about how Google Maps Platform APIs are billed, please see. 
How are map loads counted on the Google Maps Platform? 
A single map load is charged when any of the following occur: 
A web page or application displays a map using the Maps JavaScript API. 
An application requests a single map image from the Maps Static API. 
Street View panoramas are charged separately from map loads: 
A static Street View panorama is charged for each request to the Street View Static API to embed a static( non-interactive) Street View panorama. 
A dynamic Street View panorama is charged for each instantiation of a panorama object in a Maps JavaScript API, Maps SDK for Android, Maps SDK for iOS application. 
After a web page or application loads a map, or a static map image, or a Street View panorama, any user interactions with it, such as panning, zooming, or switching map layers, do not generate additional map loads or affect usage limits. 
How do I monitor my usage? 
You can monitor the usage of individual APIs in the.

What happens if I exceed the request rate( QPS) limits? 
If you exceed the of a given Google Maps Platform product, the API will return an error message. If you repeatedly exceed the limits, your access to the API may be temporarily blocked. 
If you exceed the request or otherwise abuse the service, requests will return a specific error message. If you continue to exceed limits, your access to the Google Maps Platform may be blocked. 
Note: 
Four of the web service APIs have an equivalent client-side service available in the Maps JavaScript API:,,, and. 
Usage limits exceeded 
If you exceed the usage limits you will get an 
OVER_QUERY_LIMIT 
status code as a response. 
This means that the web service will stop providing normal responses and switch to returning only status code 
OVER_QUERY_LIMIT 
until more usage is allowed again. This can happen within a few seconds, if the error was received because your application sent too many requests per second. 
If you regularly exceed your QPS usage limits, consider lowering usage, by optimizing applications to use Google Maps Platform products more efficiently. See the for more information. 
My site gets a lot of traffic. Can I use Google Maps Platform products? 
Yes. However we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the for any of the Google Maps Platform that your application relies on. 
If my web site or application becomes suddenly popular, will my maps stop working? 
If you exceed the free$ 200 monthly usage, and you do not have a valid payment instrument on your billing account( credit card, bank transfer, ...), the API ceases to function until a payment instrument is added. 
How will usage be calculated and billed? 
Usage is calculated at the end of each day, and priced as shown in the. At the end of every month, the total usage is charged to the payment method associated with your billing account. For more information, see. 
How much does it cost to use the Google Maps Platform? 
See the for an overview of cost per API. If your application generates requests or map load volumes below the complimentary$ 200 per month usage, your usage is free. Usage that exceeds the$ 200 monthly credit will be charged to your billing account. For more details, see our.

How do I avoid a large bill if my usage unexpectedly increases? 
The Google Maps Platform provides ways to set daily request limits and set maximum daily billable limits. You can cap the maximum daily limit on usage to protect against unexpected increases. You can also set budget alerts to receive email notifications when the charges on the billing account reach a threshold you set. 
Capping the maximum daily billable limit: 
To avoid a large bill, you can set a daily cap on usage to protect against unexpected increases in use. You can in the Google Cloud Platform Console by taking the following steps: 
Go to the. 
Select a project if prompted. 
Select an API from the list, then click the 
Quotas 
tab. 
Click the 
edit icon 
next to the 
'' requests per day'' 
quota. 
Alternatively, you can edit multiple quotas for multiple APIs using the. 
Tip: 
Use a simple equation to determine your daily cap depending on how much you want to spend. For example:( Monthly spend/) /30= requests per day cap( for one API). For instance, on the Maps JavaScript API, 28,000 calls can be made per month within the free tier. If you cap your Maps JavaScript API daily quota to 903( ie 28,000/ 31), you will not be charged. Note that your implementation may use multiple billable APIs, so adjust your equation as needed. Remember, a is available each month, so be sure to factor that into your calculation. 
Setting and managing budget alerts: 
to send email notifications to billing administrators when the charges on the billing account reach a threshold you set. Billing administrators will be sent email notifications when the estimated charges on the billing account exceed 50%, 90%, and 100% of the threshold. 
Key Point: 
Setting a budget does 
not 
cap API usage. The purpose of budgets is to allow you to create alerts so that you know how your spending is trending over time. Alerts prompt you to take action to control your costs, but do not prevent the use of your services when the budget is met or exceeded. If you prefer to set a hard cap on API usage to prevent accruing costs, see. 
I got a message saying that my project is linked to the`` Google Maps Platform Transition Account'', but I do n't have access to that account. What do I do? 
The`` Google Maps Platform Transition Account'' was created to help certain customers transition to our new pay-as-you-go pricing plan. This transition account enabled Google to provide these customers with a one-time credit, so that they could continue using Google Maps Platform up to the limit of the$ 200 free tier. Once this limit is exceeded, the billing account will shut down and you will lose access to the service. To avoid service interruptions, we urge you to set your own billing account, and continue to enjoy the$ 200 monthly free tier. To change the billing account for your project: 
( if you already have a billing account, you can skip this step). 
. 
Why is my quota limit set to 1 request per day? How can I raise this limit? 
If you have not created and attached a billing account to your project, your Maps Platform APIs will be limited to 1 request per day. You can get higher quota by creating and attaching a billing account. To do this, see. 
Once you have created and attached a billing account, your daily quota limit will be removed. You can decide to. 
I received a billing violation notice. How do I resolve this? 
You have received this notice because Google has determined that your account has been using multiple billing accounts. This is a violation of Google's terms, as defined in. Under these terms, it is forbidden to create multiple billing accounts. To learn more, see the. 
Using the Google Maps Platform 
Which keys or credentials should I use for different Maps products? 
Each time you use Google Maps Platform products, you must include an API key to validate your request. The Google Maps Platform is available for Android, iOS or Web apps, and via HTTP web services. 
API Key: 
An API key is a unique identifier that you generate using the. 
Example of loading an API with a key: 
& amp; key=AIzaSyBjsINSH5x39Ks6c0_CoS1yr1Mb3cB3cVo 
Digital Signature: 
A digital signature is generated using a cryptographic key provided to you by Google. Digital signatures are used with the Maps Static API and Street View Static API. 
Restrictions: 
API key restrictions are optional, but we strongly recommend you restrict all API keys for greater security. 
You can add an application restriction to the API key. Once restricted, a key will only work on platforms that support that type of restriction. Four types of application restrictions are available. APIs enforcing the same restriction type can use the same restricted key. 
IP addresses( individual servers)- for use with the. 
HTTP referrers( web sites)- for use with the. 
Android app restriction( by package name and fingerprint)- for use with the. 
iOS app restriction( by iOS bundle identifier)- for use with the. 
You can also add an API restriction to the API key. For more information, see. 
The table below indicates the key/credential and application restriction for each Google Maps Platform API/SDK.

Depending on usage, a digital signature may be required for the and. Regardless of usage, we strongly recommend that you use both an API key and a digital signature to authenticate your requests. 
How do I switch my key restriction type from an HTTP referer to an IP address restriction? 
Important: 
If you are using any of the with an API key that has referer restrictions, your requests will fail with the error message:`` API keys can not have referer restrictions when used with this API.'' You should switch to using an API key with IP address restrictions. 
Before you switch the API key restriction type from HTTP referer to IP address, ensure that all the APIs that use the API key support the IP restriction type. APIs of the same restriction type can use the same restricted key. If you need to enforce more than one restriction, add a separate key with the required restriction. See how to. 
Learn more about. 
To switch an API key with HTTP referer restriction to IP address restriction, do the following: 
Go to the Credentials page of the. 
Select the project that contains the API key you want to edit. 
On the 
Credentials 
page, from the list of API keys, select the name of the API key to edit the details of the key. 
In the 
Key restriction 
section of the page, select "IP addresses( web servers, cron jobs, etc.") and insert the appropriate server IP addresses, then click Save.

Errors and troubleshooting 
What does this error mean? 
If you encounter an error while loading or running the Google Maps APIs, please see the following links to find explanations for the error codes: 
My maps appear darker than usual. What's happening? 
Under certain circumstances, a darkened map, or 'negative' Street View image, watermarked with the text`` for development purposes only'', may be displayed. This behavior typically indicates issues with either an API key or billing. To use Google Maps Platform products, you must have a billing account and all requests must include a valid API key. The following flow will help troubleshoot this: 
Are you using an API key? 
I'm not sure. How can I check if I am using an API key? 
An API key is passed as the 
key 
parameter in the URL that is used to load the Maps JavaScript API. Here are a few options to check if you are using an API key: 
Use the Chrome extension. This allows you to determine if your website is properly implementing Google's licensed Maps APIs. 
If you are using a library or plugin to load the Maps JavaScript API, check the settings for that library and look for an API key option. 
Check. If you see the following messages, you are not using your API key correctly: 
Google Maps JavaScript API warning: 
Google Maps JavaScript API error: 
For web developers: 
If you have access to the source code of your application, look for the 
& lt; script& gt; 
tag which is used to load the Maps JavaScript API. When loading the Maps JavaScript API, substitute 
YOUR_API_KEY 
in the code below with your API key. 
& lt; script async defer src='' https: //maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js? key= 
YOUR_API_KEY 
& amp; callback=initMap''& gt;& lt; /script& gt; 
Check the network traffic generated by your website in the browser. In Chrome, this can be viewed using the 
Network 
tab. Here you will see the network requests made by your website. Requests made using the Maps JavaScript API will be under the path 
maps/api/js 
. Here you can confirm if the requests are using the 
key 
parameter. It may be helpful to by 
maps/api/js 
when viewing the 
Network 
tab. 
No, I am not using an API key. 
To get an API key, click the button below. If you do not see a guided setup, follow the full instructions at. 
Yes, I am using an API key. 
Great! Let's move on and check if a billing account is attached to your project. 
Is a billing account attached to your project? 
I'm not sure. How can I check if billing account is attached to my project? 
Go to the and select the project under which your API key was created. To confirm the key is associated with the project: 
Go to the 
Credentials 
section, which can be accessed from the left side bar under 
APIs& amp; Services& gt; Credentials 
. 
Check that the API key you currently use on your website is listed. If that's not the case, switch to a different project, and check the credentials there. 
If you can not locate the project for your API key, you may have lost access to this project. Ask others in your organization for help. If the original project can not be located, you should: 
Create a new project. This can be done by selecting 
New Project 
from the projects list, or by selecting 
Create Project 
via the. 
Create a new API key. This can be done on the 
Credentials

API key 
. 
Once you have located your project in the Google Cloud Platform Console, check if a billing account is attached by navigating to the section in the left side menu. 
No, a billing account is not attached to my project. 
Go to the and add a billing account to your project. For additional information, see. 
Yes, a billing account is attached to my project. 
Great! Let's make sure the provided billing method is valid. 
Is the provided billing method no longer valid( for example an expired credit card)? 
You in the Google Cloud Platform Console. 
Is there an exceeded self-imposed daily limit on the API? 
If you have set a daily limit on any of your APIs, which is common to prevent unexpected increases, you can resolve this by. 
You can check your daily limits in the Google Cloud Platform Console by going to the. Once there: 
Select a project if prompted. 
Select an API from the list, then click the 
Quotas 
tab. 
Does your API key have an IP addresses restriction? 
API keys with an 
IP addresses 
restriction can only be used with web services that are intended for use from the server side( such as the and other). Most of these web services have equivalent services within the Maps JavaScript API( for example, see the). To use the Maps JavaScript API client side services, you will need to create a separate API key which can be secured with an 
HTTP referrers 
restriction( see). 
How do I resolve the error codes: 
OVER_DAILY_LIMIT 
or 
OVER_QUERY_LIMIT 
? 
These error codes can be returned for any of the following reasons: 
An API key is missing from the request. 
The provided API key is invalid.

How do I resolve the error codes: 
kGMSPlacesRateLimitExceeded 
or 
9005 PLACES_API_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED 
? 
If you are seeing 
kGMSPlacesRateLimitExceeded 
or 
9005 PLACES_API_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED 
, you may be using a deprecated version of the Places SDK for Android or Places SDK for iOS. Learn more and find the new SDKs at. 
How do I resolve the error:`` This IP, site or mobile application is not authorized to use this API key.''? 
There are various scenarios which may cause this error: 
You 've enabled IP address( server) restrictions on your API key, and an unauthorized IP address is attempting a request. 
You 've enabled HTTP referrer( website) restrictions on your API key, and an unauthorized referrer is attempting a request. 
You 've restricted usage to your Android apps by setting a package name and fingerprint, and an unauthorized Android app is attempting a request. 
You 've restricted requests from iOS apps by specifying bundle indentifiers and an unrecognized iOS app is attemting to send a request. 
It used to be possible to get this error if you used any of the, with an API key with HTTP referer restrictions. Requests to those APIs should be identified with an API key with 
IP address 
restrictions.. For more information about restricting API keys, see. 
View and Edit your API Key Credentials 
To view your API keys and manage any restrictions, do the following: 
Go to the. 
Select the project that contains the API key you want to review. 
To view credential details, including any restrictions set for the key, from the list of API keys, click the name of the key. 
The full credentials of the selected API key are displayed, including any restrictions set up for the key. From here, the restrictions can be changed, deleted, or updated as needed. 
How do I resolve the error:`` API keys with referer restrictions can not be used with this API.''? 
You are using any of the with an API key restricted to an HTTP referer. For security reasons, web service APIs need to use API keys restricted to 
IP addresses 
., or create a new API key if your key is already used with the Maps JavaScript API. 
Google Maps Platform Services 
I need to convert addresses to latitude/longitude pairs. Can I do that with the Google Maps Platform? 
Yes, this process is called`` geocoding.'' The Maps JavaScript API includes a class for performing a geocoding service. The class is:. 
Alternatively, Google also provides the, which offers a REST interface that can respond in JSON and XML formats. 
Which countries is geocoding available in? 
To see countries currently supported by the Google Maps Platform geocoders, please consult the. 
The accuracy of geocoded locations may vary per country, so you should consider using the returned field to determine if a good enough match has been found for the purposes of your application. Please note that the availability of geocoding data depends on our contracts with data providers, so it is subject to change. 
Why do the Google Maps Platform Geocoders provide different locations than Google Maps? 
The API geocoder and Google Maps geocoder sometimes use different data sets( depending on the country). The API geocoder occasionally gets updated with new data, so you can expect to see results changing or improving over time. 
How should I format my geocoder queries to maximise the number of successful requests? 
The geocoder is designed to map street addresses to geographical coordinates. We therefore recommend that you format geocoder requests in accordance with the following guidelines to maximize the likelihood of a successful query: 
Specify addresses in accordance with the format used by the national postal service of the country concerned. 
Do not specify additional address elements such as business names, unit numbers, floor numbers, or suite numbers that are not included in the address as defined by the postal service of the country concerned. Doing so may result in responses with 
ZERO_RESULTS 
. 
Format plus codes as shown here( plus signs are url-escaped to 
% 2B 
and spaces are url-escaped to 
% 20 
): 
global code 
is a 4 character area code and 6 character or longer local code( 849VCWC8+R9 is 
849VCWC8% 2BR9 
). 
compound code 
is a 6 character or longer local code with an explicit location( CWC8+R9 Mountain View, CA, USA is 
CWC8% 2BR9% 20Mountain% 20View% 20CA% 20USA 
). 
Use the street number of a premise in preference to the building name where possible. 
Use street number addressing in preference to specifying cross streets where possible. 
Do not provide 'hints' such as nearby landmarks. 
How should I format a U.S. address on a numbered highway for geocoding? 
The Google Maps Platform geocoder requires that U.S. numbered highways be specified in addresses as follows: 
County Roads: 
'' Co Road 
NNN 
'' 
where 
NNN 
is the road number. eg. 
'' Co Road 82'' 
State Highways: 
'' 
State NNN 
'' 
where 
State 
is the full name of the state and 
NNN 
is the highway number. eg. 
'' California 82'' 
U.S. Highways: 
'' U.S. 
NNN 
'' 
where 
NNN 
is the highway number. eg. 
'' U.S. 101'' 
U.S. Interstates: 
'' Interstate 
NNN 
'' 
where 
NNN 
is the interstate number. eg. 
'' Interstate 280'' 
When should I use an API geocoder class and when should I use the HTTP Geocoding Service? 
See the document:, which details the pros and cons of different geocoding strategies. 
How do I provide driving directions with the Google Maps Platform? 
The Directions API allows you to provide driving directions for single and multi-leg journeys. Routing options help you shape directions with a travel mode( driving), a single or a set of routes, and restrictions( no toll roads). The service is available in the following forms: 
HTTP request/response interface 
( used in mobile and other applications) is compatible with Maps SDK for Android and with other Google Maps web services. See the for more information. 
JavaScript API 
, for client-side applications, allows you to provide driving directions via the class. The class can automatically create the overlays and directions panel for you. are provided in the documentation. 
Java, Python, go, and Node.js client interfaces 
, for server-side applications, provide the same functionality. Reference documentation is available at these links:,,, and. 
In which countries are driving directions available? 
To see countries currently supported by Driving Directions in the Google Maps Platform products, consult the. Please note that the availability of driving directions data depends on our contracts with data providers, and is subject to change. 
In which countries are transit directions available? 
The Google Maps Directions Service, which includes the and, supports all the transit providers in the, except for those in Japan. 
Which KML and GeoRSS features are supported in the Maps JavaScript API? 
The class in the Maps JavaScript API enables developers to overlay KML/KMZ and GeoRSS files on top of the map. Documentation and examples can be found. 
What are the limits on the size and complexity of KML that can be displayed using the KmlLayer class of the Maps JavaScript API? 
The size and complexity limits on the display of KML using the 
KmlLayer 
class are documented. 
What is the maximum number of markers or path vertices supported by the Maps Static API? 
There is no limit to the number of markers or path vertices supported by the Maps Static API. When using custom icons, up to five unique icons can be specified per request, but each can be used multiple times within the map. 
Note that Maps Static API URLs can contain a maximum of approximately 8,192 characters which constrains the number of markers and path vertices that can be specified based on the number of decimal places used when specifying each latitude/longitude pair. For information on how the number of decimal places used relates to the accuracy on the Earth see the Wikipedia article on. 
Why ca n't I access Google Maps Platform products for certain countries? 
Maps APIs may not be used in. Refer also to the.

What's the impact of the new iPhone X on the Google Maps iOS SDK? 
The has a new screen shape, featuring new rounded corners, a notch at the top for the device's sensor housing, and an indicator at the bottom of the screen for accessing the Home screen. In the iOS 11.0 SDK, Apple has added the allowing developers to position elements in an area which is safe from being clipped by the new screen shape. 
The Google Maps iOS SDK has many visual elements and controls, such as an indoor picker and the report a problem link. With version 2.4 these visual elements and controls could be clipped by the new screen shape. In landscape mode, the indoor floor picker may be clipped by either the notch or the home button indicator. 
With the Google Maps iOS SDK 2.5 release these layout issues are fixed automatically. When your app is used on an iPhone X, the padding on and are increased so that the visual elements are n't clipped. 
By default, we will always include your padding. The Google Maps iOS SDK assumes that padding is intended to pad from within the safe area. If you design your interface with the assumption that everything is positioned within the safe area, this will work without any extra effort. 
If you have designed an interface which does n't work with our default adjustment, we have introduced a new property to GMSMapView, called. GMSMapView now allows you to pick from one of three padding adjustments behaviors: 'Always'( default), 'Automatic', and 'Never'. 
If GMSMapView is set to use the 'Always' padding behavior, it will always add the safe area insets to the padding. This allows you to design your interface with the assumption that all placement is from the edges of the safe area. This is the default value. 
If GMSMapView is set to use the 'Automatic' padding behavior, it will always choose the larger of padding or safe area inset. This will allow you to add padding from the screen edge while always ensuring that all elements stay within the safe area. 
If GMSMapView is set to use the 'Never' padding behavior, it will never add the safe area insets to the padding. This is the behavior prior to the 2.5 release and may be useful if your padding already takes into consideration the safe area, or if our other behaviors do n't act well with your interface. It is your responsibility to ensure that the Google logo and copyright notices are always visible, as specified in the. 
In contrast, GMSPanoramaView does n't have an optional padding property. This means that there is no padding to adjust and GMSPanoramaView will always apply any necessary padding to ensure that all visual elements are within the safe area.
