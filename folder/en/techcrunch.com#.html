they can switch between feeds to highlight whoever&#8217;s speaking. Great \u2014 if speaking is how you communicate. Silent speech like sign language doesn&#8217;t trigger those algorithms, unfortunately, but this research from <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/google\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> might change that.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a real-time sign language detection engine that can tell when someone is signing (as opposed to just moving around) and when they&#8217;re done. Of course it&#8217;s trivial for humans to tell this sort of thing, but it&#8217;s harder for a video call system that&#8217;s used to just pushing pixels.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ai.googleblog.com\/2020\/10\/developing-real-time-automatic-sign.html\">A new paper from Google researchers<\/a>, presented (virtually, of course) at ECCV, shows how it can be done efficiency and with very little latency. It would defeat the point if the sign language detection worked but it resulted in delayed or degraded video, so their goal was to make sure the model was both lightweight and reliable.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Xpvo5spCEo\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/08\/19\/this-hand-tracking-algorithm-could-lead-to-sign-language-recognition\/\">This hand-tracking algorithm could lead to sign language recognition<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;This hand-tracking algorithm could lead to sign language recognition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/08\/19\/this-hand-tracking-algorithm-could-lead-to-sign-language-recognition\/embed\/#?secret=Xpvo5spCEo\" data-secret=\"Xpvo5spCEo\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The system first runs the video through a model called PoseNet, which estimates the positions of the body and limbs in each frame.

Considering how the &#8220;active speaker&#8221; detection on most calls is only so-so at telling whether a person is talking or coughing, those numbers are pretty respectable.<\/p>\n<p>In order to work without adding some new &#8220;a person is signing&#8221; signal to existing calls, the system pulls clever a little trick. It uses a virtual audio source to generate a 20 kHz tone, which is outside the range of human hearing, but noticed by computer audio systems. This signal is generated whenever the person is signing, making the speech detection algorithms <em>think<\/em> that they are speaking out loud.<\/p>\n<p>Right now it&#8217;s just a demo, which you can try here, but there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any reason why it couldn&#8217;t be built right into existing video call systems or even as an app that piggybacks on them. <a href=\"https:\/\/research.google\/pubs\/pub49425\/\">You can read the full paper here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"8iaXMwF2Vh\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/25\/ios-14-lets-deaf-users-set-alerts-for-important-sounds-among-other-clever-accessibility-perks\/\">iOS 14 lets deaf users set alerts for important sounds, among other clever accessibility perks<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;iOS 14 lets deaf users set alerts for important sounds, among other clever accessibility perks&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/25\/ios-14-lets-deaf-users-set-alerts-for-important-sounds-among-other-clever-accessibility-perks\/embed\/#?secret=8iaXMwF2Vh\" data-secret=\"8iaXMwF2Vh\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>An aspect of video calls that many of us take for granted is the way they can switch between feeds to highlight whoever&#8217;s speaking.

the<\/span> London-based VC that backs early-stage founders in Europe and Israel, recently <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/20\/kindred-capital-ii\/\">closed its second seed fund<\/a> at \u00a381 million.<\/p>\n<p>Out if its first fund raised in 2018, the firm has backed 29 companies. They include Five, which is building software for autonomous vehicles; Paddle, SaaS for software e-commerce; Pollen, a peer-to-peer marketplace for experiences and travel; and Farewill, which lets users create a will online.<\/p>\n<p>However, what sets <a href=\"https:\/\/kindredcapital.vc\/\">Kindred<\/a> apart from most other seed VCs is its &#8220;equitable venture&#8221; model that sees the founders it backs get carry in the fund, effectively becoming co-owners of Kindred. Once the VC\u2019s LPs have their investment returned, along with the firm\u2019s partners, the portfolio founders share any subsequent fund profits.<\/p>\n<p>To learn more about Kindred&#8217;s investment focus going forward and how its equitable venture model works in practice, I caught up with partners Leila Rastegar Zegna and Chrys Chrysanthou. We also discussed closing deals remotely and how the VC approaches diversity and inclusion.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TechCrunch: <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/kindredcapital\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"kindredcapital\">Kindred Capital <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> backs seed-stage startups across Europe and in Israel. Can you elaborate a bit more on the fund\u2019s remit, such as sector or specific technologies, and what you look for in founders and startups at such an early stage?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Rastegar Zegna:<\/strong> As a fund, we are very focused on the founder(s), so everything starts there. We try to drill down and get to know them as people and leaders, first and foremost. Do they have what it takes to get the company off the ground, the resilience to get through the inevitable ups and downs of startup life and through the scaling years to make this a massive outcome for the team and the investors?<\/p>\n<p>The second element we spend time thinking about is the market itself and how big the company can grow within the constraints of that market. We also think deeply about the timing of the business, especially if they are trying to create a new market, such as in quantum computing, for example.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"MMV18DmUIx\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/20\/kindred-capital-ii\/\">Kindred Capital closes \u00a381M second fund to back early-stage European startups<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Kindred Capital closes \u00a381M second fund to back early-stage European startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/20\/kindred-capital-ii\/embed\/#?secret=MMV18DmUIx\" data-secret=\"MMV18DmUIx\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><strong>Chrysanthou:<\/strong> It\u2019s also worth mentioning that many investors talk about product-market fit, but we are also great believers in founder-market fit. In other words, a founder who might be successful in one market, might well fail in another, as different skills are required and even different personality types might be better suited. One way we assess this is to look for deep insights they have to the problem they\u2019re trying to solve and how they think about their market.<\/p>\n<p>After that, we are fairly sector-agnostic, which is why we have such a diverse portfolio, ranging from consumer products through to deep science.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How has the coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns and social distancing affected the way you source and close deals?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Rastegar Zegna:<\/strong> Initially, we moved everything to video calls, like pretty much everyone else in the industry. Upon reflection, however, we realized that we were just using a new tool (e.g. Zoom) but in the old way &#8212; meaning, any meeting we used to have at Kindred HQ, we just transitioned onto Zoom. The interesting transition we\u2019re going through now is to create a new way of working around the tool. That means for some meetings, Zoom will be the most effective medium of communication. For others it may be an audio call, and for a third category of discussion, a walking meeting in the park may be what\u2019s called for.

One, there was an incredible pull from the market for technology tools. So many businesses that had put off buying technology or investing in technology really all of a sudden found themselves in a digitally-first world or a digital-only world and therefore, there was a massive pull for technology products. It\u2019s the reason why companies like Shopify and others in the public markets have had just amazing, record quarters.<\/p>\n<p>The second thing is, in venture when we raise these funds, we have a certain time period to deploy them, usually anywhere from two years to five years. So for us as investors, it\u2019s not easy to just sit on the sidelines and wait till things sort themselves out.<\/p>\n<p>So actually, a lot of venture investors have piggybacked off of this incredible pull from the market side and have been investing, I would say, at the same pace, or even a faster pace than we were before.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"\u201cThere\u2019s basically an infinite bid for these companies\u201d\">\u201cThere\u2019s basically an infinite bid for these companies.\u201d<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Are those paces the same for all stages?<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The venture world is swimming in capital these days, and the flood doesn\u2019t appear to be abating.

But scaling moderation across all of Twitter is a task the company has not been well-prepared for, as it built for scale first, then tried to figure out policies and procedures around harmful content after the fact.<\/p>\n<p>Reached for comment, Twitter declined to offer details regarding its plans for Birdwatch, but did confirm the feature was designed to combat the spread of misinformation.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re exploring a number of ways to address misinformation and provide more context for tweets on Twitter,&#8221; a Twitter spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;Misinformation is a critical issue and we will be testing many different ways to address it,&#8221; they added.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"sRD1i9kYfG\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/02\/05\/wtf-is-fake-news\/\">WTF is fake news?<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;WTF is fake news?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/02\/05\/wtf-is-fake-news\/embed\/#?secret=sRD1i9kYfG\" data-secret=\"sRD1i9kYfG\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Twitter is developing a new product called &#8220;Birdwatch,&#8221; which the company confirms is an attempt at addressing misinformation across its platform by providing more context for tweets, in the form of notes.

After aggressive product rollouts in 2016 and 2017, Google quickly abandoned its VR efforts, which, much like the Samsung Gear VR, allowed users to drop a compatible phone into a headset holster and use the phone&#8217;s display and compute to power VR experiences.<\/p>\n<p>After <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/06\/05\/apple-enters-the-augmented-reality-fray-with-arkit-for-ios\/\">Apple&#8217;s announcement of ARKit<\/a>, the company did a hard pivot away from VR, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/08\/29\/google-shows-off-arcore-its-answer-to-apples-arkit\/\">turning its specialty AR platform Tango into ARCore<\/a>, an AR developer platform that has also not seen very much attention from Google in recent months.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Google bowing out of official support from Daydream comes after years without product updates to its own View headset and very little investment in their content ecosystem, which wrecked the chances of Lenovo&#8217;s third-party effort, the standalone <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/04\/review-lenovo-mirage-solo-headset-with-google-worldsense-tracking\/\">Mirage Solo<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Once it became clear that Daydream wasn&#8217;t going to be an easy win, the company kind of just abandoned the effort. Google&#8217;s hardware business is already peanuts compared to their search and ads business, so it probably wasn&#8217;t clear what the point was. But virtual reality also quickly went from being the &#8220;it&#8221; technology to work on to clearly being a labor of love for a select few.<\/p>\n<p>Google determined it wasn&#8217;t worth the effort while <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/facebook\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"facebook\">Facebook <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> continued to double down.

Once clicked, the user can change their password and is allowed back into their account.<\/p>\n<p>But Bouimadaghene found that Grindr&#8217;s password reset page was leaking password reset tokens to the browser. That meant anyone could trigger the password reset who had knowledge of a user&#8217;s registered email address, and collect the password reset token from the browser if they knew where to look.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2055540\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2055540\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2055540\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/account-password-token.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"749\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/account-password-token.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/account-password-token.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/account-password-token.jpg?resize=300,187 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/account-password-token.jpg?resize=768,479 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/account-password-token.jpg?resize=680,424 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/account-password-token.jpg?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2055540\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Secret tokens used to reset Grindr account passwords, which are only supposed to be sent to a user&#8217;s inbox, were leaking to the browser.

In August 2018, it was spun off into a separate business unit, a move that simultaneously allowed it to gain momentum and burn more cash. After spinning off of Uber, the freight company underwent an expansion. Uber Freight <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/10\/11\/uber-freights-app-for-truck-drivers-is-getting-an-upgrade\/\">redesigned its app<\/a>, an improvement that included adding new navigation features to make searching for and filtering loads easier to customize.<\/p>\n<p>The company <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/30\/uber-freight-expands-app-to-canada\/\">expanded to Canada<\/a> and Europe. Uber Freight also established a headquarters in Chicago\u00a0as part of its parent company&#8217;s broader plan to invest more than $200 million annually in the region, including hiring hundreds of workers. Last September,\u00a0Uber said it would hire 2,000 new employees in the region over the next three years; most would be dedicated to Uber Freight.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Bm0Iq5xdw0\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/30\/uber-freight-expands-app-to-canada\/\">Uber Freight expands app to Canada<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Uber Freight expands app to Canada&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/30\/uber-freight-expands-app-to-canada\/embed\/#?secret=Bm0Iq5xdw0\" data-secret=\"Bm0Iq5xdw0\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>More recently, Uber Freight signed on new API integration partnerships with cloud TMS providers, including SAP, Blue Yonder, BluJay, MercuryGate and Oracle.

Still, that growth hasn&#8217;t translated into profit.

On political causes, Armstrong said Coinbase also does not advocate for any causes or candidates that are not related to its mission \u201cbecause it is a distraction from our mission.\u201d In that Medium post, Armstrong recognized that some employees may disagree and even resign.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A couple of days later, Armstrong began offering employees who don\u2019t feel comfortable with the direction of the company a severance package, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/79247\/coinbase-offers-exit-package-for-employees-not-comfortable-with-its-mission\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Block Crypto reported<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s always sad when we see teammates go, but it can also be what is best for them and the company,\u201d Armstrong wrote in an internal memo. \u201cAs I said in my blog post, life is too short to work a company that you aren\u2019t excited about.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It&#8217;s quite a statement to make just weeks away from a very important presidential election.

My friend overheard and she quickly asked if he would pose the same question to a man, asking if he&#8217;d &#8216;come to Microsoft to find a partner?&#8217; He got defensive and denied his originally offensive inquiry.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/discotech.tech\/techtruths\/89\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On being underpaid in tech<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This event happened prior to my joining the team, but I didn&#8217;t find out about it until years later.\u00a0 The hiring manager bragged openly about how &#8216;little&#8217; she hired me for while I was desperately leaving a toxic work environment. I pushed back, she was persistent and being afraid of losing the offer I took it. I ended up leaving the position for a job that paid market value. Irony.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/discotech.tech\/techtruths\/30\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On being a Black woman in tech<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m not sure where to begin with the amount of discomfort I&#8217;ve experienced in the work place. As a Black, woman in tech I&#8217;m all too familiar with being an extreme minority. I guess you could say my discomfort began at the beginning of my professional career. I accepted a position at my company in a 6 month training program for recent college graduates. Upon arrival at orientation I realized I was the only Black woman out of 70 participants. 70 other co-workers and I was the only one. I felt completely alone and as if I had no one who could relate to my unique experience. From there, it was small incident after small incident that caused my discomfort to grow. From my technical trainer referring to me as Sheba, as in the Queen of Sheba, in the middle of a training session to my colleagues constantly questioning my intelligence, work became a stressful environment. It didn&#8217;t help that when I tried to reach out throughout the company for assistance with existing in the workplace, I was often told to keep to myself and try my best to \u2018fit in.\u2019 It took me a while to find a support system but I&#8217;m glad I finally did because the amount of microaggressions I face on daily basis is often overwhelming.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Labor Organizing<\/h2>\n<hr \/>\n<h3><b>Shipt shoppers protest new pay model<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/29\/shipt-shoppers-are-organizing-a-walkout-in-protest-of-new-pay-model\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shipt shoppers are organizing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a handful of actions in protest of Shipt\u2019s new pay structure that began rolling out this month. The first action is happening from Saturday, Oct. 17 through Oct. 19, when workers are calling on their fellow Shipt shoppers to walk out and boycott the company. Organizers are asking for shoppers not to schedule any hours or accept any orders during that time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOur goal is to draw attention to the fact that this pay scale really does affect shoppers and regardless of Shipt\u2019s position of it taking into account effort and benefitting shoppers, we are finding it is the opposite on both fronts,\u201d Willy Solis, a Shipt shopper in Dallas and lead organizer at Gig Workers Collective, told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s not holding up to the true reality. We are getting paid less for more effort.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Spin workers ratify first union contract<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/29\/spin-worker-union-contract\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A group of 40 workers at Ford-owned Spin ratified<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> their first union contract with Teamsters Local 665 this week.

We also got holiday pay and vacation, which we didn\u2019t have before we organized,\u201d Spin worker Shamar Bell said in a statement. \u201cAll this means a lot during the pandemic. We know our union will have our back if our boss or the city government tries to make changes. I can say for sure, we\u2019re proud to be Teamsters.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As part of the three-year agreement, Spin workers will get annual pay raises of more than 3% each year, six paid holidays (compared to zero holidays), vacation days based on years of employment (compared to no vacation days), five sick days a year, a $1,200 per employee ratification bonus, benefits accrual for part-time workers and other benefits.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">In Other News<\/h2>\n<hr \/>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/29\/serious-injuries-at-amazon-fulfillment-centers-topped-14000-despite-the-companys-safety-claims\/\">Serious injuries at Amazon fulfillment centers topped 14,000, despite the company\u2019s safety claims<\/a> &#8211; TechCrunch<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/tech\/tech-news\/lack-oversight-transparency-leave-amazon-employees-dark-covid-19-n1241549\">Lack of oversight and transparency leave Amazon employees in the dark on Covid-19<\/a> &#8211; NBC News<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.latimes.com\/california\/story\/2020-09-30\/california-law-requires-diversity-corporate-boardrooms-gavin-newsom\">Newsom signs law mandating more diversity in California corporate boardrooms<\/a> &#8211; The Los Angeles Times<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/onezero.medium.com\/bird-is-quietly-luring-contract-workers-into-debt-through-a-new-scooter-scheme-3fa34fb4a0f\">Bird Is Quietly Luring Contract Workers Into Debt Through a New Scooter Scheme<\/a> &#8211; OneZero<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/30\/aoc-palantir-letter\/\">AOC flagged \u2018material risks\u2019 to Palantir investors in letter to SEC<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>By the way, TechCrunch Sessions: Mobility is coming up next week.

Physical retail commands about 97% of all retail sales in India, according to estimates from several research firms.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We believe Reliance Retail will continue to use its extensive supply chain and store networks, as well as strong logistics and data infrastructure, to add value to its customers and shareholders,\u201d said Lim Chow Kiat, CEO of GIC, in a statement.<\/p>\n<p>Reliance Retail operates supermarkets, electronics chain, fashion outlets and a cash-and-carry wholesaler. In recent months, the firm has rushed to widen its dominance in the retail market. It <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/29\/indias-reliance-retail-to-acquire-future-groups-retail-wholesale-and-logistics-businesses-for-3-4-billion\/\">bought several parts of Future Group<\/a>, India&#8217;s second largest retail chain, for $3.4 billion in late August.<\/p>\n<p>Late last year, it also entered the e-commerce space with JioMart. JioMart, a joint venture between Reliance Retail and Jio Platforms, has presence in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/23\/jiomart-the-e-commerce-venture-by-indias-richest-man-launches-in-additional-cities\/\">over 200 Indian cities and towns<\/a>, and maintains a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/26\/reliance-and-facebook-pilot-jiomart-orders-on-whatsapp\/\">partnership with Facebook for WhatsApp integration<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook, which <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/21\/facebook-reliance-jio\/\">invested $5.7 billion in Jio Platforms earlier this year<\/a>, has said it will explore various ways to work with Reliance to digitize the nation\u2019s 60 million mom and pop stores as well as other small and medium-sized businesses.<\/p>\n<p>Jio Platforms has raised more than $20 billion in India this year from a roster of marquee investors, including Facebook, Google, General Atlantic, Mubadala, Silver Lake and KKR. Some industry executives have argued that investments in Jio Platforms <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/30\/indian-startups-explore-forming-an-alliance-and-alternative-app-store-to-fight-googles-monopoly\/\">make no business case<\/a> and is largely foreign firms&#8217; push to get friendly with Ambani, India&#8217;s richest man and an ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I am delighted that GIC, with its track record of close to four decades of successful long-term value investing across the world, is partnering with Reliance Retail in its mission to transform the Indian retail landscape.

inevitable squiggly line denoting a misspelled word or clumsy phrase. But what if you use a word that&#8217;s loaded, a phrase that&#8217;s too formal or not formal enough, or refer to a group of people in an outdated way? <a href=\"https:\/\/writer.com\/\">Writer<\/a> is a service that watches as you type, flagging language that doesn&#8217;t match up with your style guide and values, and it just raised $5 million to scale up.<\/p>\n<p>Both people and the companies they work for want to improve the way they write, but not just in terms of grammar and spelling. If a company says it&#8217;s inclusive, but the language in its press releases or internal blogs are peppered with anachronisms and bias, it suggests their concern only goes so far.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Companies are hungry to put actions behind their words,&#8221; said <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/writer\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"writer\">Writer <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> founder and CEO May Habib. &#8220;They want to be able to tell a consistent story to their users everywhere that they&#8217;re interacting with them. What Writer does is let people know when they&#8217;re using insensitive language, or things that could be considered negative, and let companies set brand guidelines.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Right off the bat let us admit that there is a whiff of the sinister about the idea of a company dictating how its employees speak, though that&#8217;s nothing new when it comes to content and official communications. But this isn&#8217;t about controlling speech for power \u2014 it&#8217;s about recognizing that we are all flawed communicators and could use a hand keeping ourselves honest. Less thought police and more a well-informed angel sitting on your shoulder whispering things like, &#8220;Hey. Are you sure you want to describe that lawyer as &#8216;exotic&#8217;?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2055205\" style=\"width: 828px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/writer-check.gif\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2055205\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2055205\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/writer-check.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"818\" height=\"406\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2055205\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Examples of things Writer checks for. <strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Writer<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>There are tons of slip-ups we all make along those lines; less obvious, but no less potentially offensive. It&#8217;s important in public communications, among other things, to refer to a group by the term they prefer, not the first one that pops into your head; Writer has up-to-date libraries of this information sourced from the communities themselves. Some phrases may have become politically loaded in the last couple of years, but you&#8217;re not aware; no problem, it has alternatives. You want to avoid unnecessarily gendered language, great, but everyone slips up now and then; Writer can spot it \u2014 or make the connection with previous pronouns to make sure you don&#8217;t, for example, gender an anonymous source.<\/p>\n<p>Accusations of &#8220;political correctness&#8221; will dog the service, but as Habib put it: &#8220;This is beyond politics; this is about respect for people who live a certain way, or are a certain way, and prefer to use certain terms. We&#8217;re trying to help companies create communities of belonging.&#8221; And as we&#8217;ve seen over and over again in tech, there is often a serious disconnect between the stated aspiration of a company and how people are treated within them. Just using the right words is a pretty low bar to start with, honestly.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2055201\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Writer-Inclusivity.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2055201\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2055201\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Writer-Inclusivity.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"782\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Writer-Inclusivity.png 1230w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Writer-Inclusivity.png?resize=150,115 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Writer-Inclusivity.png?resize=300,229 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Writer-Inclusivity.png?resize=768,586 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Writer-Inclusivity.png?resize=680,519 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Writer-Inclusivity.png?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2055201\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Writer<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Writer isn&#8217;t just a growing blacklist of words you should think twice about using, though. The natural language processing engine at the heart of it is also very concerned with things like sentence complexity, paragraph length and tone. It has to have this deeper understanding, Habib explained, because &#8220;it&#8217;s not enough to underline \u2014 you need to know what to replace it with, and when you replace it, you need to fit it into the sentence. These are actually hard NLP problems.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That lets it fit into a variety of roles in addition to promoting inclusive language.

Writer is less about preventing an individual writer&#8217;s errors, and more about creating consistency among groups of writers and making sure they are working from the same high-level linguistic standards.<\/p>\n<p>Of course security is also a concern \u2014 no one wants a keylogger running on their machine, however helpful it may be. Habib was careful to emphasize that Writer runs locally in the browser as a plug-in, integrating with Word or Chrome for now but with other apps and services on the way. &#8220;None of that data ever hits a writer server, and no metadata \u2014 all the processing is done in the text area,&#8221; she said. The only data that&#8217;s sent back is the fact that a given suggestion was used, such as changing &#8220;should of&#8221; to &#8220;should have&#8221; or &#8220;illegal aliens&#8221; to &#8220;undocumented immigrants.&#8221; No user data is used to train the models and no content apart from the correction itself is sent or stored on Writer&#8217;s servers.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Jq84wdosLC\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/07\/here-are-a-few-ways-gpt-3-can-go-wrong\/\">Here are a few ways GPT-3 can go wrong<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Here are a few ways GPT-3 can go wrong&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/07\/here-are-a-few-ways-gpt-3-can-go-wrong\/embed\/#?secret=Jq84wdosLC\" data-secret=\"Jq84wdosLC\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Writer is available now, for $11\/person\/month (with the obligatory free trial period, of course) for a basic version and some unspecified amount for enterprise deals with multiple style guides, plagiarism detection, and so on.

a blockchain-verified platform for selling houses, raises funding from Tim Draper"},"content":{"rendered":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For several years, blockchain technology has been touted as a way to verify the sale of property. Any kind of property. And so entrepreneurs busily began the process of trying to create a startup that could complete a property deal on the blockchain. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One that stood out from the start was <a href=\"https:\/\/propy.com\">Propy<\/a>, <\/span><span class=\"s1\">started by Natalia Karayaneva, an experienced, real-world property developer who had subsequently joined the blockchain world. Propy&#8217;s other co-founder is Denitza Tyufekchieva (pictured).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/propy.com\/browse\/\">Propy<\/a><\/span><span class=\"s1\"> has now raised an undisclosed funding round from venture capitalist investor <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/timothydraper\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Tim Draper<\/span><\/a>, best known for his early investments into Tesla, Skype, Twitter, Coindesk and Robinhood. TechCrunch understands this is part of a wider, ongoing fundraise.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Propy\u2019s platform uses blockchain technology to, it says, simplify the home-purchasing experience and eliminate fraudulent transactions. The idea is to close a traditional real estate deal entirely online. Thus, the offer, signed purchase agreements with DocuSign, secure wire payments and title deeds are all taken care of. Propy claims its platforms saves 10 hours of paperwork, per transaction. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cMy vision for Propy is to bring self-driving real estate transactions to the world, with all of the logistics seamlessly executed on the back-end,\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>Karayaneva said in a statement. \u201cOur platform offers a terminal to observe transactions in real-time, making the process transparent for real estate executives, title companies, homebuilders, buyers, and REITs. With this new investment we are excited to bring much-needed change to the industry, satisfy consumers and empower real estate professionals all over the world.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But this is not some out-there, wacky crypto-play. Most of the transactions are done in dollars on Propy, meaning it could be used by mainstream users from day one, as it\u2019s able to process wire transfers via integration with a money transmitter connected to 70 banks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Speaking to TechCrunch, <span class=\"s1\">Karayaneva added: <\/span>&#8220;We do not replace lawyers, but rather help them, closing attorney&#8217;s share documents with consumers and agents via Propy. With DocuSign integrated, they can sign the documents on <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/propy\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"propy\">Propy <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and all parties get notified. In the U.S., agents have ready forms in Propy to fill out and they don\u2019t need lawyers in a transaction at all.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Crucially, Propy has an enterprise play going on here as well. Its platform can provide the back-office system to real estate enterprises with real-time transaction reports and automated compliance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Draper said: \u201cPropy has the potential to transform real estate, making transactions and titles simpler, more secure, and less expensive through innovative use of blockchain technology. [It] eliminates fraud and makes the closing process more secure, effective and streamlined.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">According to one survey, almost <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investmentexecutive.com\/news\/research-and-markets\/pandemic-has-millennials-dreaming-of-home-ownership\/\"><span class=\"s2\">one-fifth<\/span><\/a><\/span><span class=\"s2\"> of millennials <\/span><span class=\"s4\">h<\/span><span class=\"s1\">ave now thought about buying a home because of the lock-downs induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, meaning that many will be looking for an easy way to transact, especially if it has the ease of use Propy has.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Propy has some fellow-travelers in the blockchain prop-tech space. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.shelterzoom.com\">ShelterZoom<\/a> is a Blockchain platform used for virtual and remote collaboration with offices and clients, while <a href=\"https:\/\/www.streetwire.net\">StreetWire<\/a> is a Blockchain-based data service for the real estate industry.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"DIyjC4fwHL\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/03\/9-top-real-estate-and-proptech-investors-cities-and-offices-still-have-a-future\/\">9 top real estate and proptech investors: Cities and offices still have a future<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;9 top real estate and proptech investors: Cities and offices still have a future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/03\/9-top-real-estate-and-proptech-investors-cities-and-offices-still-have-a-future\/embed\/#?secret=DIyjC4fwHL\" data-secret=\"DIyjC4fwHL\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For several years, blockchain technology has been touted as a way to verify the sale of property.

In the U.K. and Europe, you pay 2% in fees or a minimum fee of \u00a30.45\/\u20ac0.52, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>You also need to have a compatible card. Not all debit cards support incoming transfers. You need to have a Visa card that supports Visa Fast Funds. In the U.S., you can also use a <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/mastercard\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"mastercard\">Mastercard <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> card with Mastercard Send.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to know whether your bank or card issuer support those features. The best way to figure it out is probably by adding your card to Coinbase and seeing what Coinbase says.<\/p>\n<p>Coinbase isn\u2019t removing other withdrawal methods. For instance, if you\u2019re looking for a cheaper way to withdraw your funds in Europe, a SEPA bank transfer costs \u20ac0.15 per transfer.

Unscreen is dead simple drag-and-drop background removal for video"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Removing the background of a video you&#8217;ve shot can be a real pain if you don&#8217;t have the kind of tools and setup used by professionals \u2014 and even then it isn&#8217;t as easy as it should be. Kaleido&#8217;s one-step background removal tool for images, remove.bg, has graduated to full-motion video with the company&#8217;s new product, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unscreen.com\/\">Unscreen<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The service itself is simple enough. You drag a video onto the Unscreen webpage, and a few minutes later (depending on the size and resolution of the content) you get it back, with everything gone but the person or object in the foreground.<\/p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s first product was <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/01\/08\/remove-bg-photoshop-free-image-background-editor\/\">remove.bg<\/a>, which was the same sort of thing but for still images; it was a big hit on Product Hunt. As someone who has to do a bit of work in that line myself now and then, it&#8217;s nice to know there&#8217;s a very simple, effective web service for snipping out the background quickly and accurately, even though I know I could do the same thing in Photoshop with a bit of work.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"4YqnAUs5sD\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/01\/08\/remove-bg-photoshop-free-image-background-editor\/\">This cool tool deletes the background from images so you don&#8217;t have to use Photoshop<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;This cool tool deletes the background from images so you don&#8217;t have to use Photoshop&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/01\/08\/remove-bg-photoshop-free-image-background-editor\/embed\/#?secret=4YqnAUs5sD\" data-secret=\"4YqnAUs5sD\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>After nine months out there, remove.bg is serving millions of users monthly, 25,000 of which are actually paying customers. Clearly there is demand for this type of service, and going from stills to video is a natural move, though of course the amount of computing power required is many times more. Kaleido tested the waters with an experimental MVP back in March, and developed Unscreen on the back of that.<\/p>\n<p>The idea is, understandably, to become the go-to tool for creators who have little time to spare or don&#8217;t want to deal with heavy-duty options like Premiere. On <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/youtube\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"youtube\">YouTube <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and other platforms, speed is paramount if you want to have the first unboxing video or reaction to news, but maintaining production value is important, and people will be put off by janky live background removal that makes the creator look like an amateur.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/cIn-dOGuTHo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Speaking of which, Kaleido chose to compete in the offline video processing space because there are entrenched and competitive offerings available from <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/zoom-video-communications\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"zoom-video-communications\">Zoom, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Microsoft and others in the video chat space, where &#8220;good enough&#8221; is just fine. But there are comparatively fewer options for offline video editing, and fewer still that anyone can operate with no expertise at all.<\/p>\n<p>In Hollywood (which is to say in cinema and high-end video production in general) the world of compositing is changing, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/20\/how-the-mandalorian-and-ilm-invisibly-reinvented-film-and-tv-production\/\">with LED walls like those used on The Mandalorian<\/a> an attractive, though expensive and complex, alternative to the standard green screen or frame-by-frame rotoscoping. A simple one-step process to easily remove backgrounds for quick-turnaround shoots, dailies and other situations could be a godsend for many a VFX tech or production studio.<\/p>\n<p>At all events the market is evolving but clearly exists, as paying customers attest. Kaleido is totally self-funded so far, with no need or desire to take on investors, since its income scales with its expenses and exposure.<\/p>\n<p>As with most media products these days, Unscreen comes in a freemium subscription model. You can try it out with clips up to 10 seconds long for free (but the watermarked, low-resolution files aren&#8217;t really suitable for publication), then there are the usual subscription tiers, from $9 to $389 per month depending on how much footage you plan on uploading. Two-thirds of its income is from small businesses, but it also counts several major enterprises and media companies among its paying customers.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, none of that matters if the product itself doesn&#8217;t work. I tested it out on a five-minute, 720p video of a woman with long hair, and it finished in about 45 minutes. The end result was good, with the hair nicely preserved and only a handful of small glitches that would be easy to paint out if desired. A minute and a half of myself talking into the camera in 1080p took about 33 minutes, and a somewhat clearer 23-second video of a colleague turned out very crisp in about 10 minutes.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2055294\" style=\"width: 1818px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/me-bknd.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2055294\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2055294 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/me-bknd.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1808\" height=\"1065\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/me-bknd.jpg 1808w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/me-bknd.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/me-bknd.jpg?resize=300,177 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/me-bknd.jpg?resize=768,452 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/me-bknd.jpg?resize=680,401 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/me-bknd.jpg?resize=1536,905 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/me-bknd.jpg?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1808px) 100vw, 1808px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2055294\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">I bet at first you thought this still was from Fashion Week too, right?<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>You might say, why so long? Zoom does it in real time. Yes, but at a low resolution and quality. It&#8217;s not the kind of thing you&#8217;d want to put online publicly and permanently, or use in a commercial shoot. From what I could tell, the quality of Unscreen&#8217;s removal was considerably better, but not straight-to-final good. You&#8217;ll want to watch it first to snag any issues.<\/p>\n<p>Users have the option to render the video directly with a still, video or solid color background, or a two-channel (alpha and color files) version for feeding into an editor. Other options are limited, so if you want to upscale, resize, re-render with a different color, etc., you&#8217;re out of luck. This isn&#8217;t an online video editing platform \u2014 it&#8217;s a web-hosted video effect and should be treated as such.<\/p>\n<p>One thing Kaleido has been careful to demonstrate \u2014 and it&#8217;s sad to think that this is a differentiator \u2014 is that its products work with people whose skin tone and hair confound other solutions. The bare fact that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/21\/twitter-and-zoom-algorithmic-bias-issues\/\">some background removal processes work better with light-skinned people than dark-skinned<\/a>, or with straight hair than curly, is a sad indicator of a lack of diversity in the training set that produced those tools.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2055299\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/good-hair.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2055299\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2055299\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/good-hair.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"573\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/good-hair.jpg 1379w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/good-hair.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/good-hair.jpg?resize=300,168 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/good-hair.jpg?resize=768,429 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/good-hair.jpg?resize=680,380 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/good-hair.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2055299\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Curly hair is notoriously difficult for computer vision algorithms, but Unscreen&#8217;s does a decent job of it.<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Kaleido&#8217;s Bernhard Holzer told me that this was top of mind from the beginning, and that the team has been careful to assemble training data from all over the world to make sure the product works equally well no matter which country or hemisphere the user is in. They keep an eye out for unexpected issues; for instance, it was found that a person with a commencement cap on moving the tassel from one side to the other wasn&#8217;t handled well by the system \u2014 so they added a bunch of data to fix it. Users are encouraged to give feedback and the system is constantly evolving to take advantage of it.<\/p>\n<p>The company itself is growing, and expects to double in size to about 30 employees this year \u2014 and as noted remains funded by its own income. The appetite for web tools is certainly considerable, and until now the idea of a single-click background removal one didn&#8217;t exactly make sense.

href=\"https:\/\/soraschools.com\/\">Sora<\/a>, a startup run by a team of Atlanta entrepreneurs, was toying with the idea of live, virtual high school. The program would focus on student autonomy and organize its curriculum around projects that learners wanted to work on, such as finding ways to reduce the impact of climate change on the world. Students and teachers would use Zoom and Slack to communicate with each other, with standups everyday to pulse-check progress.<\/p>\n<p>The pandemic has both undermined and underscored Sora\u2019s focus. On one end, the millions of students that flocked home have shown how hard it is to effectively and accessibly teach in virtual settings. On the other end, the pandemic isn\u2019t going away any time soon. Parents and students are desperate for better options.<\/p>\n<p>Sora co-founder <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/gwsmiley\/\">Garrett Smiley<\/a> thinks he can convince parents to approach virtual high school with optimism, their kids and their checkbooks. It all starts with green algae farms.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Smiley said students turn to Sora so they can \u201cstart running instead of walking\u201d in their education. He added how the first students in the program spent time building algae farms in their backyards, working with SpaceX engineers and taking college-level math classes upon entrance.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"MXRK20IWkJ\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/why-hasnt-digital-learning-lived-up-to-its-promise\/\">Why hasn&#8217;t digital learning lived up to its promise?<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Why hasn&#8217;t digital learning lived up to its promise?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/why-hasnt-digital-learning-lived-up-to-its-promise\/embed\/#?secret=MXRK20IWkJ\" data-secret=\"MXRK20IWkJ\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Smiley, who co-founded the company with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/indrasofian\/\">Indra Sofian<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/wesley-samples-53879195\/\">Wesley Samples<\/a>, says that Sora sells best to students who feel stifled or \u201cheld back\u201d from traditional educational institutions. Sora\u2019s product, thus, feels more apt for educationally gifted students than students who might need extra help or support.<\/p>\n<p>At Sora\u2019s heart, it is a private school replacement with a project-based curriculum. How it works beyond that is a little bit more confusing to comprehend. Firstly, students upon enrollment embark on two-week learning expeditions, exploring the answers to broad questions like \u201chow do we recreate an alien species.\u201d As time progresses, students are prompted to create their own projects with check-in calls twice a day. Below is an example of a standup:<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Nef7Qp5JwNY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Beyond the self-directed study, Sora offers a series of Socratic seminars and workshops.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no such thing as science class, but there are workshops such as \u201cthe Physics of Sharks.\u201d Here&#8217;s an example schedule of a Sora student:<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2055548\" style=\"width: 691px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2055548\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-2055548\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/IMG_4318.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"681\" height=\"561\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/IMG_4318.jpg 1125w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/IMG_4318.jpg?resize=150,123 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/IMG_4318.jpg?resize=300,247 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/IMG_4318.jpg?resize=768,632 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/IMG_4318.jpg?resize=680,560 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/IMG_4318.jpg?resize=50,41 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2055548\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Sora<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The organization is unconventional. Smiley is insistent on the fact that students complete core subjects and standards needed for high school transcript and graduation, including math, science, English and history. Students are also required to take the SAT or ACT, with practice resources provided by the school.<\/p>\n<p>Sora also has an in-person, optional element. Cohorts will be designed by geography. Students are encouraged to meet up with each other outside of school, form sports teams and attend a Sora-sponsored meet-up.<\/p>\n<p>Outside of learning, Sora created a network of more than 50 career mentors and has a suite of services, such as SAT prep and counselors to aid with the college admissions process.<\/p>\n<p>Smiley says that Sora hasn\u2019t yet graduated a class, so they do not have data on most common exit paths, but he added that the company does not promote college as the only option for students.<\/p>\n<p>Sora is working on partnering with the \u201cnext generation of college and university replacements,\u201d he says, such as boot camps or internships.<\/p>\n<p>The goal of Sora is to create a community of self-directed and motivated learners.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe don&#8217;t believe schools are in the business of content creation anymore, just typing in Google search engine search specifically you&#8217;ll probably find world-class resources to learn a subject,\u201d Smiley said. \u201cSo for us, as to be a super successful school, we knew our role was creating this super high-quality community.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The company had seven students in its inaugural class last year. Now, more than 39 students participate in Sora School, with three-full time faculty. Monthly tuition ranges from $300 to $800 per student.<\/p>\n<p>Tuition is charged in relation to parent income by using a sliding scale, which Smiley says is part of their strategy in making sure Sora is an inclusive and diverse school.<\/p>\n<p>The diversity breakdown of Sora is 67% white, 15% Hispanic, 13% African American and 5% Asian\/Middle Eastern. The gender split male to female is 54% and 44%, respectively, with 2% of students identifying as non-binary.<\/p>\n<p>From a mental diversity perspective, Sora lacks key resources needed to support students with special needs. Virtual high school as a product isn\u2019t built for adoption en masse, but instead works best for students who can afford to partake in self-directed and independent learning. Similar to pandemic pods, it could exacerbate the widening inequalities between wealthy and low-income students.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"hH7X92XvSs\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/06\/are-learning-pods-the-future-of-edtech-remote-learning\/\">Can learning pods scale, or are they widening edtech&#8217;s digital divide?<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Can learning pods scale, or are they widening edtech&#8217;s digital divide?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/06\/are-learning-pods-the-future-of-edtech-remote-learning\/embed\/#?secret=hH7X92XvSs\" data-secret=\"hH7X92XvSs\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Smiley says that they \u201cdefinitely thought about\u201d accessibility and are working on it.
