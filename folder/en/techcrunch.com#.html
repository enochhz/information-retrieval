Individuals involved in the plot organized across Facebook groups, in-person events and at least two encrypted chat apps that the FBI did not name.<\/p>\n<p>Whitmer, a Democrat, became a major target of pervasive anti-lockdown sentiment on the political right earlier this year when states imposed restrictions to slow the spread of the coronavirus. According to the affidavit, at a June in-person meeting, members of the group &#8220;talked about murdering &#8216;tyrants&#8217; or &#8216;taking&#8217; a sitting governor.&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/opa\/pr\/six-arrested-federal-charge-conspiracy-kidnap-governor-michigan\">Thirteen people<\/a> have been charged in relation to the kidnapping plot.<\/p>\n<p>The group grew its numbers after contacting a Michigan-based militia known as the Wolverine Watchmen that shared overlapping interests.

Just this week, Facebook announced both a broader ban on the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/06\/facebook-qanon-ban\/\">pro-Trump conspiracy known as QAnon<\/a> and a new policy for <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/07\/facebook-poll-watching-trump-election-political-ads\/\">voter intimidation efforts<\/a> that use militaristic language.<\/p>\n<p>When asked if the terror plot had an impact on the company&#8217;s recent spate of surprising policy changes, Facebook did not provide a direct response. It&#8217;s also not clear if the domestic terror plot used Facebook groups to recruit and connect online or just to communicate among members who already knew each other in real life.<\/p>\n<p>Researchers who study extremism have long expressed concerns that Facebook&#8217;s algorithmic recommendations can push users toward dangerous ideas \u2014 and dangerous behavior.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"NTb75g00Jo\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/06\/facebook-qanon-ban\/\">Facebook says it will ban QAnon across its platforms<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Facebook says it will ban QAnon across its platforms&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/06\/facebook-qanon-ban\/embed\/#?secret=NTb75g00Jo\" data-secret=\"NTb75g00Jo\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Militias and other kinds of domestic extremist groups have increasingly leaned on Facebook for recruitment in recent years. Once members are connected and vetted, often through public groups, they are allowed into an inner circle, sometimes in the form of a private Facebook group. The Proud Boys, a violent far-right group with ties to white supremacists, were <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/08\/10\/proud-boys-facebook-mcinnes\/\">a prominent example<\/a> of this recruitment strategy.<\/p>\n<p>Users can be ushered into these extremist groups by Facebook&#8217;s algorithmic suggestions, which previously appeared in a box next to a group&#8217;s activity. For Facebook pages, those suggestions still appear to the side of the main stream of content, directing users toward &#8220;related pages.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Facebook <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/10\/30\/facebook-proud-boys-mcinnes-kicked-off\/\">banned the Proud Boys<\/a> from its platform in late 2018. But groups interested in violence that kept a lower profile have maintained a large presence on the platform well into 2020, including a number of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adl.org\/resources\/glossary-terms\/patriot-movement\">state &#8220;patriot&#8221; organizations<\/a> and anti-government <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/2020\/6\/8\/21276911\/boogaloo-explained-civil-war-protests\">boogaloo groups<\/a> that coordinate firearm and combat trainings through the platform.<\/p>\n<p>In June, Facebook <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/30\/facebook-boogaloo-ban\/\">banned a &#8220;violent network&#8221; of boogaloo groups<\/a>, but other groups remain, organizing under code words related to the boogaloo movement.

a boom in SPACs, few women investors"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">If you&#8217;ve been following the SPAC boom, you may have noticed something about these blank-check vehicles that are springing up left and right in order to take public privately held companies. They are being organized mostly by men.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not surprising, given the relative dearth of women in senior financial positions in banking and the venture industry. But it also begs the question of whether women, already hustling to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/outlook\/2019\/04\/02\/america-doesnt-just-have-gender-pay-gap-it-has-gender-wealth-gap\/\">overcome a wealth gap<\/a>, could be left behind if the trend gains momentum.<\/p>\n<p>Consider that <a href=\"https:\/\/pitchbook.com\/media\/press-releases\/pitchbook-all-raise-report-on-venture-financing-in-female-founded-startups-shows-progress-yet-continued-gender-inequity\">studies<\/a> have shown women investors are are twice as likely to invest in startups with at least one female founder, and more than three times as likely to invest in startups with female CEOs. It&#8217;s not a huge leap to imagine that women-led SPACs might also be more inclined to identify women-led companies with which to merge and take public.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>SPAC sponsors can reap handsome rewards, too. In return for lining up investors, then persuading a target company to accept the terms it offers them, sponsors typically receive 25% of the SPACs founder shares, which can mean a lot of money in a short amount of time, given that SPACs typically aim to merge with a company in two years or less. In fact, even if the SPAC performs terribly &#8212; say the company with which it merges is later <a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/NKLA\/chart\/\">accused of fraud<\/a> &#8212; those sponsors get paid.<\/p>\n<p>Eventbrite cofounder Kevin Hartz, who is overseeing a $200 million SPAC, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/21\/almost-everything-you-need-to-know-about-spacs\/\">explained it to us<\/a> in August this way: &#8220;On a $200 million SPAC, there\u2019s a $50 million \u2018promote\u2019 that is earned.\u201d But \u201cif that company doesn\u2019t perform and, say, drops in half over a year or 18-month period, then the shares are still worth $25 million. (Hartz himself called this guaranteed payout \u201cegregious,\u201d though he and his partner in the SPAC, Troy Steckenrider, didn&#8217;t structure their SPAC differently, saying that as a first-time SPAC sponsor, they wanted to keep things straightforward.)<\/p>\n<p>Women aren&#8217;t entirely unaccounted for in the current SPAC craze. Thanks to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sos.ca.gov\/business-programs\/women-boards\">state law<\/a> passed in California in 2018, nearly all SPACs based in California have a female director, as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/spac-california-gender-rule-6ba4d12b-c310-4670-aa8e-ecc0ccf8838e.html\">reported earlier by Axios<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In the last two weeks, at least three SPACs to register with the SEC have been launched exclusively or in part by sponsors who are women. Hope Taiz, a New York-based investor who began her investment banking career at Drexel Burnham Lambert, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.renaissancecapital.com\/IPO-Center\/News\/71991\/Growth-focused-SPAC-Aequi-Acquisition-files-for-a-$300-million-IPO\">registered plans<\/a> this week with the SEC to raise a $300 million blank-check company called Aequi Acquisition.<\/p>\n<p>Northern Star Acquisition, a consumer-focused SPAC co-led by magazine vet Joanna Coles, meanwhile filed for a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/consumer-focused-spac-northern-star-acquisition-files-for-a-%24300-million-ipo-2020-09-29\">$300 million IPO<\/a> last week, and Climate Change Crisis Real Impact I Acquisition, a SPAC focused on climate technology, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.renaissancecapital.com\/IPO-Center\/News\/71711\/Climate-Change-Crisis-Real-Impact-I-Acquisition-a-SPAC-led-by-the-former-CE\">raised $200 million <\/a>in an <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/ipo\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"ipo\">IPO <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>. The blank check company is co-led by Mary Powell, the former CEO of Green Mountain Power.<\/p>\n<p>One SPAC sponsor &#8212; Betsy Cohen, a founder and former CEO of the financial services company Bancorp &#8212; has really taken to SPACs, establishing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crowdfundinsider.com\/2020\/09\/165777-spac-bancorp-founder-betsy-cohens-new-750-million-special-purpose-acquisition-company-to-acquire-fintech-business\/\">four fintech-related shell firms<\/a> so far, the most recent of which raised $750 million last month. (As an interesting aside, the SPAC programs of both <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gL6_L9vxIRU\">Goldman Sachs<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/tinapappas\/\">Jefferies<\/a> are led by women.)<\/p>\n<p>Given these developments, some might wonder &#8212; reasonably &#8212; if it isn&#8217;t a little early to worry about women missing out on this apparent gold rush. Still, women-led SPACs represent a tiny percentage of the 133 SPACs that have raised more than $50 billion in proceeds this year at last count.<\/p>\n<p>More, the only tech <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">investors to jump into the pool to date are exclusively men, including Chamath Palihapitiya of Social Capital (who has <\/span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/cant-stop-wont-stop-social-capital-hedosophia-just-filed-for-its-fourth-spac-says-new-report\/\">dozens<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> of SPACs in mind); Hartz and Steckenrider; entrepreneur-investors <\/span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/09\/18\/business\/dealbook\/hoffman-pincus-spac.html\">Reid Hoffman and Mark Pincus<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">, Ribbit Capital&#8217;s <\/span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.renaissancecapital.com\/IPO-Center\/News\/70579\/Ribbit-Capitals-fintech-SPAC-Ribbit-LEAP-files-for-a-$350-million-IPO\">Mickey Malka<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">; former Uber executive <\/span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/02\/controversial-former-uber-exec-emil-michael-has-registered-plans-for-a-250-million-spac\/\">Emil Michael<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">; and the founders of <\/span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.renaissancecapital.com\/IPO-Center\/News\/71979\/FirstMark-Capitals-tech-SPAC-FirstMark-Horizon-Acquisition-prices-upsized-$\">FirstMark Capital<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>It isn&#8217;t that their female counterparts aren&#8217;t paying attention, seemingly. A number of top women VCs with whom we&#8217;ve talked say they&#8217;re following the action and weighing how to participate. One such prominent investor told us she&#8217;s been researching under what circumstances it makes sense for VC firms to engage in a SPAC&#8217;s origination.<\/p>\n<p>Others may be looking to gain exposure first to SPACs through their portfolio companies. Dana Grayson of Construct Capital, for example, led an early investment in the 3D printing company <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/desktop-metal\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"desktop-metal\">Desktop Metal <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> &#8212; which is <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/26\/desktop-metal-going-public-in-spac-led-deal-that-could-value-3d-printer-company-at-2-5b\/\">going public through a SPAC-led deal<\/a> &#8212;\u00a0 while a partner the firm NEA. At TechCrunch&#8217;s recent Disrupt event, Grayson, speaking about Desktop Metal, called SPACs a &#8220;great new <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/21\/a-meeting-room-of-ones-own-three-vcs-discuss-breaking-out-of-big-firms-to-found-their-own-gigs\/\">viable alternative<\/a> for companies.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Either way, observes Kristi Marvin, a former investment banker who now runs the data site <a href=\"https:\/\/spacinsider.com\/\">SPACInsider<\/a>, it&#8217;s not time to panic, she suggests.<\/p>\n<p>For one thing, as with &#8220;most banking things, SPACs skew heavily male,&#8221; so it&#8217;s to be expected that many more men are sponsoring SPACs. The SPAC market is also on the verge of overheating, based on what she is seeing. &#8220;You have 10 deals trying to price in the same day, and investors are tapped out.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>SPACs also require a learning curve that some underestimate. &#8220;It&#8217;s why you see hedge funds and PE firms more involved in SPACs; they have infrastructure to do them versus three guys who are facing a ton of work just to do the administrative side of things,&#8221; notes Marvin.<\/p>\n<p>As with other financial products, Marvin expects to see more women embrace SPACs over time, especially if they prove to be as durable as many early adherents suggest. That said, she adds, &#8220;If in a year or two, it&#8217;s still only male VCs who&#8217;ve dipped their toe into SPACs, it may be a problem.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you&#8217;ve been following the SPAC boom, you may have noticed something about these blank-check vehicles that are springing up left and right in order to take public privately held companies.

target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"affirm\">Affirm, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> a startup focused on providing point-of-sale credit to consumers making online purchases, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.affirm.com\/press\/releases\/affirm-announces-confidential-submission-of-draft-registration-statement\">announced that it has filed to go public<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The filing is confidential, so there&#8217;s little to be gleaned about the company&#8217;s performance from the news. That Affirm was exploring a public offering was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/affirm-prepares-ipo-that-could-value-fintech-firm-at-up-to-10-billion-11596143292\">reported by the Wall Street Journal back in July<\/a>. In the aftermath of that news, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/31\/working-to-understand-affirms-reported-ipo-pricing-hopes\/\">TechCrunch tried to understand the valuation<\/a> that Affirm was said to be targeting in its debut, which we placed at as much as $10 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Affirm has been richly funded throughout its private life. The fintech unicorn has raised private funds in excess of $1 billion, including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/funding_round\/affirm-series-g--8369cd0e\">a $500 million Series G in September of 2020<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/funding_round\/affirm-series-f--87997e72\">a $300 million Series F in April of 2019<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/funding_round\/affirm-series-e--ce60ebc2\">a $200 million Series E in December of 2017<\/a>. Affirm also raised more than $400 million in earlier equity rounds, and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/10\/13\/levchins-affirm-secures-100m-credit-line-from-morgan-stanley\/\">a $100 million debt line in late 2016<\/a>.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Many venture bets are therefore riding on the success of Affirm and its future liquidity.<\/p>\n<p>The company was valued at $2.9 billion at the time of its $300 million Series F last year according <a href=\"http:\/\/pitchbook.com\">to PitchBook data<\/a>. The company&#8217;s most recent valuation is not known. How much of a step-up a $10 billion public valuation would be, therefore, from its final private valuation is not clear.<\/p>\n<p>Affirm will enter warm public markets if it chooses to list in short-order. The third quarter of 2020 was a bonanza of public-market liquidity, as the United States saw its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pwc.com\/us\/en\/services\/deals\/capital-markets-watch-quarterly.html\">most active quarter of public offerings since at least 2016<\/a>, partially driven by the craze around SPACs. With retail investors and larger checkbooks alike active in their interest for growth-focused shares, unprofitable tech startups have done well in their recent debuts.<\/p>\n<p>Those that make money have done even better, certain outliers like Snowflake aside.<\/p>\n<p>After a confidential filing, Affirm will wait to hear back from the SEC on its application, and then will have the choice to file a nonconfidential S-1 when it is ready. There is no set timeline here, but once the company&#8217;s numbers are public, we&#8217;ll be diving into them. Affirm joins other recent companies like Palantir who filed their public offerings confidentially first, before later making them public.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"XDakEQF1cA\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/31\/working-to-understand-affirms-reported-ipo-pricing-hopes\/\">Working to understand Affirm&#8217;s reported IPO pricing hopes<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Working to understand Affirm&#8217;s reported IPO pricing hopes&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/31\/working-to-understand-affirms-reported-ipo-pricing-hopes\/embed\/#?secret=XDakEQF1cA\" data-secret=\"XDakEQF1cA\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This afternoon Affirm, a startup focused on providing point-of-sale credit to consumers making online purchases, announced that it has filed to go public.

vacation, so <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dannycrichton\">Danny<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/alex\">your humble servant<\/a> had to endeavor alone. She&#8217;s back next week, so we&#8217;ll be back to full strength as a collective soon enough.<\/p>\n<p>But even with a depleted hosting crew, we had a mountain of news to get through. And to joke about, as Danny was in the mood for a laugh. Here&#8217;s the rundown:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/reddit-cofounder-alexis-ohanians-new-venture-fund-invests-in-disposable-camera-app-11602072245\">Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian\u2019s New Venture Fund Invests in Disposable Camera App<\/a>: Danny and I are arbiters of what is cool, so we were the perfect pair to discuss influencers and new social applications. This one is actually neat, and Ohanian&#8217;s inclusion in the investment viz his new fund was noteworthy.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/07\/zira-raises-3-1m-for-its-shift-scheduling-service-that-helps-manage-hourly-workers\/\">Zira raises $3.1M for its shift-scheduling service that helps manage hourly workers<\/a>: This is a round that I covered, looking into <a href=\"http:\/\/zira.ai\">Zira.ai<\/a> and its product. Our take? It&#8217;s neat, but operates in a competitive market.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/07\/shogun-raises-35m-to-help-brands-take-on-amazon-with-faster-and-better-sites-of-their-own\/\">Shogun raises $35M to help brands take on Amazon with faster and better sites of their own<\/a>: This is a similar story. A neat company with a neat product in a space where there is proven demand (TAM, in other words), and competition.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/07\/unqorks-207m-series-c-underscores-growing-enterprise-demand-for-no-code-apps\/\">Unqork&#8217;s $207M Series C underscores growing enterprise demand for no-code apps<\/a>: Another round worth mentioning is the Unqork deal. Unqork is a no-code service that helps other businesses create apps for their companies. It&#8217;s growing like a weed, and is thus something worth knowing a bit about.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/alexkonrad\/2020\/10\/07\/video-startup-mmhmm-raises-31-million-pre-launch\/#1c49e2c1bcc2\">Mmhmm, Five-Month-Old Video Startup Making Virtual Meetings More Fun, Raises $31 Million Pre-Launch<\/a>: Yes, mmhmm has raised more money, and, we&#8217;re excited to learn, could be launching this very month.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/06\/remotion-raises-13m-to-create-a-workplace-video-platform-for-short-spontaneous-conversations\/\">Remotion raises $13M to create a workplace video platform for short, spontaneous conversations<\/a>: Following the Slack news, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/06\/remotion-raises-13m-to-create-a-workplace-video-platform-for-short-spontaneous-conversations\/\">this round stood out to us<\/a>.

keeps millions of Americans home, Hong Kong-based Lalamove believes it can seize the growing demand for delivery services in the country. It makes its debut in the Dallas Fort-Worth area, a major hub for distribution and logistics in the U.S. In days the service will launch in Chicago and Houston.<\/p>\n<p>The startup was one of the first in Hong Kong to hit the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/20\/lalamove-raises-300m\/\">$1 billion unicorn valuation mark<\/a> alongside its archrival <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/reeve-kwan-95658645\/?originalSubdomain=hk\">GoGoVan<\/a>. Its business is multifold and highly localized, but essentially it works as an Uber for businesses and individuals that need to move goods within the city.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>In China, where it&#8217;s known as Huolala (\u8d27\u62c9\u62c9), it primarily serves as a broker between shippers who need to send cargo and a network of truck drivers. In Southeast Asia, the business functions similarly with the addition of food delivery for restaurants, a crowded and cash-burning space. In the U.S., its fleet of sedans, SUVs and pickup trucks are available 24\/7, allowing it to target customers spanning catering, retail, e-commerce, manufacturing and construction, with fees <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lalamove.com\/us\/dallas\/en\/pricing\">starting at $8.90<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDelivery is essential, especially during the pandemic. But many local businesses don\u2019t have or cannot afford in-house fleets, so we\u2019re excited to work with businesses in the Dallas Fort-Worth area to provide same-day, on-demand delivery services to their customers,\u201d said Blake Larson, international managing director at Lalamove and formerly co-founder of Rocket Internet&#8217;s Asia-focused e-hailing startup <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/01\/09\/easy-taxi-confirms-asia-exit\/\">Easy Taxi<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Like GoGoVan, Lalamove was founded by a <a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/shchow\/?originalSubdomain=hk\">Hong Kong entrepreneur<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> who was educated in the U.S. Both companies have scored fundings from heavyweight institutions from China and elsewhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Lalamove&#8217;s investors<a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/easyvan\/company_financials\"> included<\/a>\u00a0Hillhouse Capital, Sequoia Capital China and Xiaomi founder&#8217;s Shunwei Capital. Through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/hongkong-gogovan-fundraising\/hks-gogovan-chinas-58-suyun-follow-merger-with-200-mln-fundraising-idUKL4N1LH3N5\">a merger with China&#8217;s 58 Suyun<\/a>, GoGoVan counts Tencent, Alibaba, KKR and New Horizon Capital amongst its backers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The Hong Kong startup&#8217;s global expansion comes at a time when TikTok stumbles in the U.S. due to its links to China. In the logistics startup&#8217;s case, a Chinese team operates the Chinese division Huolala, while separate international teams manage the overseas segments of Lalamove, TechCrunch understands. The core of TikTok&#8217;s challenge in the U.S. is the video app&#8217;s dependence on its Chinese parent ByteDance&#8217;s technological capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>To date, Lalamove has verified and onboarded more than 500 partner drivers in Dallas Fort-Worth, with plans to add another 500 in the area by the end of this year. It&#8217;s also hiring for its regional operational office at a time when the U.S. is struck by widespread virus-induced layoffs, furloughs and slowdown in hiring.<\/p>\n<p>Lalamove claims it has to date matched more than 7 million users with a pool of over 700,000 delivery partners in 22 markets around the world.<\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Lalamove, an on-demand logistics service active in China, Southeast Asia, and Latin America, has officially entered the U.S.\u00a0seven years after launch.

a boom in SPACs, few women investors"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">If you&#8217;ve been following the SPAC boom, you may have noticed something about these blank-check vehicles that are springing up left and right in order to take public privately held companies. They are being organized mostly by men.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not surprising, given the relative dearth of women in senior financial positions in banking and the venture industry. But it also begs the question of whether women, already hustling to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/outlook\/2019\/04\/02\/america-doesnt-just-have-gender-pay-gap-it-has-gender-wealth-gap\/\">overcome a wealth gap<\/a>, could be left behind if the trend gains momentum.<\/p>\n<p>Consider that <a href=\"https:\/\/pitchbook.com\/media\/press-releases\/pitchbook-all-raise-report-on-venture-financing-in-female-founded-startups-shows-progress-yet-continued-gender-inequity\">studies<\/a> have shown women investors are are twice as likely to invest in startups with at least one female founder, and more than three times as likely to invest in startups with female CEOs. It&#8217;s not a huge leap to imagine that women-led SPACs might also be more inclined to identify women-led companies with which to merge and take public.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>SPAC sponsors can reap handsome rewards, too. In return for lining up investors, then persuading a target company to accept the terms it offers them, sponsors typically receive 25% of the SPACs founder shares, which can mean a lot of money in a short amount of time, given that SPACs typically aim to merge with a company in two years or less. In fact, even if the SPAC performs terribly &#8212; say the company with which it merges is later <a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/NKLA\/chart\/\">accused of fraud<\/a> &#8212; those sponsors get paid.<\/p>\n<p>Eventbrite cofounder Kevin Hartz, who is overseeing a $200 million SPAC, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/21\/almost-everything-you-need-to-know-about-spacs\/\">explained it to us<\/a> in August this way: &#8220;On a $200 million SPAC, there\u2019s a $50 million \u2018promote\u2019 that is earned.\u201d But \u201cif that company doesn\u2019t perform and, say, drops in half over a year or 18-month period, then the shares are still worth $25 million. (Hartz himself called this guaranteed payout \u201cegregious,\u201d though he and his partner in the SPAC, Troy Steckenrider, didn&#8217;t structure their SPAC differently, saying that as a first-time SPAC sponsor, they wanted to keep things straightforward.)<\/p>\n<p>Women aren&#8217;t entirely unaccounted for in the current SPAC craze. Thanks to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sos.ca.gov\/business-programs\/women-boards\">state law<\/a> passed in California in 2018, nearly all SPACs based in California have a female director, as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/spac-california-gender-rule-6ba4d12b-c310-4670-aa8e-ecc0ccf8838e.html\">reported earlier by Axios<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In the last two weeks, at least three SPACs to register with the SEC have been launched exclusively or in part by sponsors who are women. Hope Taiz, a New York-based investor who began her investment banking career at Drexel Burnham Lambert, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.renaissancecapital.com\/IPO-Center\/News\/71991\/Growth-focused-SPAC-Aequi-Acquisition-files-for-a-$300-million-IPO\">registered plans<\/a> this week with the SEC to raise a $300 million blank-check company called Aequi Acquisition.<\/p>\n<p>Northern Star Acquisition, a consumer-focused SPAC co-led by magazine vet Joanna Coles, meanwhile filed for a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/consumer-focused-spac-northern-star-acquisition-files-for-a-%24300-million-ipo-2020-09-29\">$300 million IPO<\/a> last week, and Climate Change Crisis Real Impact I Acquisition, a SPAC focused on climate technology, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.renaissancecapital.com\/IPO-Center\/News\/71711\/Climate-Change-Crisis-Real-Impact-I-Acquisition-a-SPAC-led-by-the-former-CE\">raised $200 million <\/a>in an <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/ipo\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"ipo\">IPO <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>. The blank check company is co-led by Mary Powell, the former CEO of Green Mountain Power.<\/p>\n<p>One SPAC sponsor &#8212; Betsy Cohen, a founder and former CEO of the financial services company Bancorp &#8212; has really taken to SPACs, establishing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crowdfundinsider.com\/2020\/09\/165777-spac-bancorp-founder-betsy-cohens-new-750-million-special-purpose-acquisition-company-to-acquire-fintech-business\/\">four fintech-related shell firms<\/a> so far, the most recent of which raised $750 million last month. (As an interesting aside, the SPAC programs of both <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gL6_L9vxIRU\">Goldman Sachs<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/tinapappas\/\">Jefferies<\/a> are led by women.)<\/p>\n<p>Given these developments, some might wonder &#8212; reasonably &#8212; if it isn&#8217;t a little early to worry about women missing out on this apparent gold rush. Still, women-led SPACs represent a tiny percentage of the 133 SPACs that have raised more than $50 billion in proceeds this year at last count.<\/p>\n<p>More, the only tech <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">investors to jump into the pool to date are exclusively men, including Chamath Palihapitiya of Social Capital (who has <\/span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/cant-stop-wont-stop-social-capital-hedosophia-just-filed-for-its-fourth-spac-says-new-report\/\">dozens<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> of SPACs in mind); Hartz and Steckenrider; entrepreneur-investors <\/span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/09\/18\/business\/dealbook\/hoffman-pincus-spac.html\">Reid Hoffman and Mark Pincus<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">, Ribbit Capital&#8217;s <\/span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.renaissancecapital.com\/IPO-Center\/News\/70579\/Ribbit-Capitals-fintech-SPAC-Ribbit-LEAP-files-for-a-$350-million-IPO\">Mickey Malka<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">; former Uber executive <\/span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/02\/controversial-former-uber-exec-emil-michael-has-registered-plans-for-a-250-million-spac\/\">Emil Michael<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">; and the founders of <\/span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.renaissancecapital.com\/IPO-Center\/News\/71979\/FirstMark-Capitals-tech-SPAC-FirstMark-Horizon-Acquisition-prices-upsized-$\">FirstMark Capital<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>It isn&#8217;t that their female counterparts aren&#8217;t paying attention, seemingly. A number of top women VCs with whom we&#8217;ve talked say they&#8217;re following the action and weighing how to participate. One such prominent investor told us she&#8217;s been researching under what circumstances it makes sense for VC firms to engage in a SPAC&#8217;s origination.<\/p>\n<p>Others may be looking to gain exposure first to SPACs through their portfolio companies. Dana Grayson of Construct Capital, for example, led an early investment in the 3D printing company <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/desktop-metal\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"desktop-metal\">Desktop Metal <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> &#8212; which is <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/26\/desktop-metal-going-public-in-spac-led-deal-that-could-value-3d-printer-company-at-2-5b\/\">going public through a SPAC-led deal<\/a> &#8212;\u00a0 while a partner the firm NEA. At TechCrunch&#8217;s recent Disrupt event, Grayson, speaking about Desktop Metal, called SPACs a &#8220;great new <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/21\/a-meeting-room-of-ones-own-three-vcs-discuss-breaking-out-of-big-firms-to-found-their-own-gigs\/\">viable alternative<\/a> for companies.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Either way, observes Kristi Marvin, a former investment banker who now runs the data site <a href=\"https:\/\/spacinsider.com\/\">SPACInsider<\/a>, it&#8217;s not time to panic, she suggests.<\/p>\n<p>For one thing, as with &#8220;most banking things, SPACs skew heavily male,&#8221; so it&#8217;s to be expected that many more men are sponsoring SPACs. The SPAC market is also on the verge of overheating, based on what she is seeing. &#8220;You have 10 deals trying to price in the same day, and investors are tapped out.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>SPACs also require a learning curve that some underestimate. &#8220;It&#8217;s why you see hedge funds and PE firms more involved in SPACs; they have infrastructure to do them versus three guys who are facing a ton of work just to do the administrative side of things,&#8221; notes Marvin.<\/p>\n<p>As with other financial products, Marvin expects to see more women embrace SPACs over time, especially if they prove to be as durable as many early adherents suggest.

While armed political groups had long been flourishing on the platform, the company cracked down on what it calls &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2020\/08\/addressing-movements-and-organizations-tied-to-violence\/\">militarized social movements<\/a>&#8221; in August. Just this week, Facebook announced both a broader ban on the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/06\/facebook-qanon-ban\/\">pro-Trump conspiracy known as QAnon<\/a> and a new policy for <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/07\/facebook-poll-watching-trump-election-political-ads\/\">voter intimidation efforts<\/a> that use militaristic language.<\/p>\n<p>When asked if the terror plot had an impact on the company&#8217;s recent spate of surprising policy changes, Facebook did not provide a direct response. It&#8217;s also not clear if the domestic terror plot used Facebook groups to recruit and connect online or just to communicate among members who already knew each other in real life.<\/p>\n<p>Researchers who study extremism have long expressed concerns that Facebook&#8217;s algorithmic recommendations can push users toward dangerous ideas \u2014 and dangerous behavior.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"NTb75g00Jo\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/06\/facebook-qanon-ban\/\">Facebook says it will ban QAnon across its platforms<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Facebook says it will ban QAnon across its platforms&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/06\/facebook-qanon-ban\/embed\/#?secret=NTb75g00Jo\" data-secret=\"NTb75g00Jo\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Militias and other kinds of domestic extremist groups have increasingly leaned on Facebook for recruitment in recent years. Once members are connected and vetted, often through public groups, they are allowed into an inner circle, sometimes in the form of a private Facebook group. The Proud Boys, a violent far-right group with ties to white supremacists, were <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/08\/10\/proud-boys-facebook-mcinnes\/\">a prominent example<\/a> of this recruitment strategy.<\/p>\n<p>Users can be ushered into these extremist groups by Facebook&#8217;s algorithmic suggestions, which previously appeared in a box next to a group&#8217;s activity. For Facebook pages, those suggestions still appear to the side of the main stream of content, directing users toward &#8220;related pages.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Facebook <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/10\/30\/facebook-proud-boys-mcinnes-kicked-off\/\">banned the Proud Boys<\/a> from its platform in late 2018. But groups interested in violence that kept a lower profile have maintained a large presence on the platform well into 2020, including a number of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adl.org\/resources\/glossary-terms\/patriot-movement\">state &#8220;patriot&#8221; organizations<\/a> and anti-government <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/2020\/6\/8\/21276911\/boogaloo-explained-civil-war-protests\">boogaloo groups<\/a> that coordinate firearm and combat trainings through the platform.<\/p>\n<p>In June, Facebook <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/30\/facebook-boogaloo-ban\/\">banned a &#8220;violent network&#8221; of boogaloo groups<\/a>, but other groups remain, organizing under code words related to the boogaloo movement. One boogaloo page TechCrunch identified calling itself &#8220;definitely not boogaloo&#8221; was selling &#8220;Boogaloo Boys&#8221; patches and posting violent memes as recently as this week.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately for researchers and reporters tracking this kind of activity, Facebook recently removed the option to see how many members are in a public group at a glance from the search page.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook recently announced a plan to actually <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/01\/facebook-groups-to-gain-suite-of-new-tools-for-managing-discussions-surfacing-public-content\/\">expand the reach of its public groups<\/a>, surfacing them to more users. &#8220;Public Group posts may now get more distribution on and off Facebook so that more people can discover and join in on the conversation,&#8221; Facebook wrote in the announcement.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Kn4srUrhkT\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/07\/facebook-poll-watching-trump-election-political-ads\/\">Facebook: Trump can&#8217;t recruit &#8216;army&#8217; of poll watchers under new voter intimidation rules<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Facebook: Trump can&#8217;t recruit &#8216;army&#8217; of poll watchers under new voter intimidation rules&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/07\/facebook-poll-watching-trump-election-political-ads\/embed\/#?secret=Kn4srUrhkT\" data-secret=\"Kn4srUrhkT\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/2020-election\/\"><img src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/us-2020-election-footer.png\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>According to details from a shocking new affidavit, the FBI uncovered a group planning &#8220;violent action against multiple state governments,&#8221; including a detailed plot to capture or kill Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.

She&#8217;s back next week, so we&#8217;ll be back to full strength as a collective soon enough.<\/p>\n<p>But even with a depleted hosting crew, we had a mountain of news to get through. And to joke about, as Danny was in the mood for a laugh.

This one is actually neat, and Ohanian&#8217;s inclusion in the investment viz his new fund was noteworthy.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/07\/zira-raises-3-1m-for-its-shift-scheduling-service-that-helps-manage-hourly-workers\/\">Zira raises $3.1M for its shift-scheduling service that helps manage hourly workers<\/a>: This is a round that I covered, looking into <a href=\"http:\/\/zira.ai\">Zira.ai<\/a> and its product. Our take? It&#8217;s neat, but operates in a competitive market.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/07\/shogun-raises-35m-to-help-brands-take-on-amazon-with-faster-and-better-sites-of-their-own\/\">Shogun raises $35M to help brands take on Amazon with faster and better sites of their own<\/a>: This is a similar story. A neat company with a neat product in a space where there is proven demand (TAM, in other words), and competition.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/07\/unqorks-207m-series-c-underscores-growing-enterprise-demand-for-no-code-apps\/\">Unqork&#8217;s $207M Series C underscores growing enterprise demand for no-code apps<\/a>: Another round worth mentioning is the Unqork deal. Unqork is a no-code service that helps other businesses create apps for their companies. It&#8217;s growing like a weed, and is thus something worth knowing a bit about.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/alexkonrad\/2020\/10\/07\/video-startup-mmhmm-raises-31-million-pre-launch\/#1c49e2c1bcc2\">Mmhmm, Five-Month-Old Video Startup Making Virtual Meetings More Fun, Raises $31 Million Pre-Launch<\/a>: Yes, mmhmm has raised more money, and, we&#8217;re excited to learn, could be launching this very month.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/06\/remotion-raises-13m-to-create-a-workplace-video-platform-for-short-spontaneous-conversations\/\">Remotion raises $13M to create a workplace video platform for short, spontaneous conversations<\/a>: Following the Slack news, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/06\/remotion-raises-13m-to-create-a-workplace-video-platform-for-short-spontaneous-conversations\/\">this round stood out to us<\/a>.

drones or insects such as moths, which can traverse through narrow spaces better than any drone and sustain much longer flights,&#8221; said Gollakota in a UW news release. He&#8217;s made a specialty of demonstrating new capabilities at extremely small scales, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/12\/11\/bumble-bees-bearing-high-tech-backpacks-act-as-a-living-data-collection-platform\/\">bee backpacks<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/19\/technique-to-beam-hd-video-with-99-percent-less-power-could-sharpen-the-eyes-of-smart-homes\/\">super low-power video transmission<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The sensor platform, which you can see below on top of a penny, could be anything from environmental monitoring to a microphone or light-sensing device.

To keep things lightweight and simple, the little sensor is held on with a tiny magnetic pin. A wireless signal can be sent that creates a current in a coil surrounding the pin, affecting its magnetic field and dropping the gadget.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s small enough to be carried quiet easily by a moth \u2014 though it must be noted that the hawk moth isn&#8217;t exactly the smallest moth of all time; they get up to hummingbird size, as I&#8217;ve experienced myself.

Maybe that&#8217;s the next experiment.<\/p>\n<p>Cheap, long-lasting sensors carried to every corner of an ecosystem by moths (or other insects) could produce very interesting data for those who study those ecosystems.

Interestingly, while they&#8217;re solving for the same problems, they have very different backgrounds and approaches.<\/p>\n<p>Hou and Sofman started out by talking about why they were pursuing the trucking market in the first place. (Quotes have been lightly edited for clarity.)<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;The market is massive; I think in the United States, $700-$800 billion a year is spent on the trucking industry. It&#8217;s continuing to grow every single year,&#8221; said Sofman, who joined Waymo from Anki last year to lead the effort in freight. &#8220;And there&#8217;s a huge shortage of drivers today, which is only going to increase over the next period of time. It&#8217;s just such a clear need. But it&#8217;s not going to be overnight \u2014 there&#8217;s still a really long tail of challenges that you can&#8217;t avoid. So the way we talk about it is the things that are hardest are just different.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really the cost and reward analysis, thinking about building the operating system,&#8221; said Hou. &#8220;The cost is the number of features that you develop, and the reward is basically how many miles are you driving \u2014 you charge on a per mile basis. From that cost-reward analysis, trucking is simply the natural way to go for us. The total number of issues that you need to solve is probably 10 times less, but maybe, you know, five times harder.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really hard to quantify those numbers, though,&#8221; he concluded, &#8220;but you get my point.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"AtOkcwaE4W\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/26\/tusimple-seeking-250-million-in-new-funding-to-scale-self-driving-trucks\/\">TuSimple seeking $250 million in new funding to scale self-driving trucks<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;TuSimple seeking $250 million in new funding to scale self-driving trucks&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/26\/tusimple-seeking-250-million-in-new-funding-to-scale-self-driving-trucks\/embed\/#?secret=AtOkcwaE4W\" data-secret=\"AtOkcwaE4W\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The two also discussed the complexity of creating a perceptual framework good enough to drive with.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Even if you have perfect knowledge of the world, you have to predict what other objects and agents are going to do in that environment, and then make a decision yourself and the combination knows is very challenging,&#8221; said Sofman.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s really helped us is a realization from the car side of the of the company many, many years ago that in order to help us solve this problem in the easiest way possible, and facilitate the challenges downstream, we had to create our own sensors,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;And so we have our own lidar, our own radar, our own cameras, and they have incredibly unique properties that were custom designed through five generations of hardware that try to really lean into the kind of most challenging situations that you just can&#8217;t avoid on the road.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"GnDwnMK941\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/02\/12\/wtf-is-lidar\/\">WTF is lidar?<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;WTF is lidar?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/02\/12\/wtf-is-lidar\/embed\/#?secret=GnDwnMK941\" data-secret=\"GnDwnMK941\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Hou explained that while many autonomous systems are descended from the approaches used in the famous DARPA Grand Challenge 15 years ago, TuSimple&#8217;s is a little more anthropomorphic.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;m heavily influenced by my background, which has a tinge of neuroscience.

For me, I&#8217;m trying to answer the question of, how do we reconstruct the world?

These are things that are very hard to model.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Sofman, on the other hand, felt that while the problems are different, solving one contributes substantially to solving the other: &#8220;If you break up the problem into the many, many building blocks of an AV system, there&#8217;s a pretty huge leverage where even if you don&#8217;t solve the problem 100% it takes away 85%-90% of the complexity. We use the exact same sensors, exact same compute infrastructures, simulation framework, the perception system carries over, very largely, even if we have to retrain some of the models. The core of all of our algorithms are, we&#8217;re working to keep them the same.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>You can see the rest of that last exchange in the video above.

target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"affirm\">Affirm, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> a startup focused on providing point-of-sale credit to consumers making online purchases, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.affirm.com\/press\/releases\/affirm-announces-confidential-submission-of-draft-registration-statement\">announced that it has filed to go public<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The filing is confidential, so there&#8217;s little to be gleaned about the company&#8217;s performance from the news. That Affirm was exploring a public offering was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/affirm-prepares-ipo-that-could-value-fintech-firm-at-up-to-10-billion-11596143292\">reported by the Wall Street Journal back in July<\/a>. In the aftermath of that news, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/31\/working-to-understand-affirms-reported-ipo-pricing-hopes\/\">TechCrunch tried to understand the valuation<\/a> that Affirm was said to be targeting in its debut, which we placed at as much as $10 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Affirm has been richly funded throughout its private life. The fintech unicorn has raised private funds in excess of $1 billion, including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/funding_round\/affirm-series-g--8369cd0e\">a $500 million Series G in September of 2020<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/funding_round\/affirm-series-f--87997e72\">a $300 million Series F in April of 2019<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/funding_round\/affirm-series-e--ce60ebc2\">a $200 million Series E in December of 2017<\/a>. Affirm also raised more than $400 million in earlier equity rounds, and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/10\/13\/levchins-affirm-secures-100m-credit-line-from-morgan-stanley\/\">a $100 million debt line in late 2016<\/a>.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Many venture bets are therefore riding on the success of Affirm and its future liquidity.<\/p>\n<p>The company was valued at $2.9 billion at the time of its $300 million Series F last year according <a href=\"http:\/\/pitchbook.com\">to PitchBook data<\/a>. The company&#8217;s most recent valuation is not known. How much of a step-up a $10 billion public valuation would be, therefore, from its final private valuation is not clear.<\/p>\n<p>Affirm will enter warm public markets if it chooses to list in short-order. The third quarter of 2020 was a bonanza of public-market liquidity, as the United States saw its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pwc.com\/us\/en\/services\/deals\/capital-markets-watch-quarterly.html\">most active quarter of public offerings since at least 2016<\/a>, partially driven by the craze around SPACs. With retail investors and larger checkbooks alike active in their interest for growth-focused shares, unprofitable tech startups have done well in their recent debuts.<\/p>\n<p>Those that make money have done even better, certain outliers like Snowflake aside.<\/p>\n<p>After a confidential filing, Affirm will wait to hear back from the SEC on its application, and then will have the choice to file a nonconfidential S-1 when it is ready. There is no set timeline here, but once the company&#8217;s numbers are public, we&#8217;ll be diving into them. Affirm joins other recent companies like Palantir who filed their public offerings confidentially first, before later making them public.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"XDakEQF1cA\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/31\/working-to-understand-affirms-reported-ipo-pricing-hopes\/\">Working to understand Affirm&#8217;s reported IPO pricing hopes<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Working to understand Affirm&#8217;s reported IPO pricing hopes&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/31\/working-to-understand-affirms-reported-ipo-pricing-hopes\/embed\/#?secret=XDakEQF1cA\" data-secret=\"XDakEQF1cA\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This afternoon Affirm, a startup focused on providing point-of-sale credit to consumers making online purchases, announced that it has filed to go public.

Lack of macro distribution, consumption and audience data<\/h2>\n<p>There were several resources that released updates based on what they saw in terms of consumption when COVID-19 hit. Hosting platforms, publishers and third-party tracking platforms all put out their best guesses as to what was happening. Advertisers\u2019 own podcast listening habits had been upended due to lockdowns; they wanted to know how broader changes in listening habits were affecting their campaigns. Were downloads going up, down or staying the same? What was happening with sports podcasts, without sports?<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><em>Read part 1 of this article, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/08\/podcast-advertising-has-a-business-intelligence-gap\/\">Podcast advertising has a business intelligence gap<\/a>, on TechCrunch.<\/em><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"wmzbDiSaC9\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/08\/podcast-advertising-has-a-business-intelligence-gap\/\">Podcast advertising has a business intelligence gap<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Podcast advertising has a business intelligence gap&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/08\/podcast-advertising-has-a-business-intelligence-gap\/embed\/#?secret=wmzbDiSaC9\" data-secret=\"wmzbDiSaC9\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<p>At Right Side Up, we receive and analyze all of the available research from major publishers (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.stitcher.com\/\">Stitcher<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.acast.com\/\">aCast<\/a>), to major platforms (<a href=\"https:\/\/megaphone.fm\/\">Megaphone<\/a>) and third-party research firms (<a href=\"http:\/\/analytics.podtrac.com\/\">Podtrac<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.iab.com\/\">IAB<\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.edisonresearch.com\/\"> Edison Research<\/a>). However, no single entity encompasses the entire space or provides the kind of interactive, off-the-shelf customizable SaaS product we\u2019d prefer, and that digitally native marketers expect. Plus, there isn\u2019t anything published in real-time; most sources publish once or twice annually.<\/p>\n<p>So what did we do? We reached out to trusted publishers and partners to gather data around shifting consumption due to COVID-19 ourselves, and determined that, though there was a drop in downloads in the short term, it was neither as precipitous nor as enduring as some had feared. This was confirmed by some <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/megaphonepods\/the-top-3-podcasting-trends-were-observing-f2237866d65\">early<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/analytics.podtrac.com\/blog\/2020\/4\/13\/weekly-podcast-data-amid-the-coronavirus-crisis-update-through-april-12-2020\">reports<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/acast\/podcastings-resilience-and-the-automated-opportunity-for-brands-8901837541f5\">available<\/a>, but how were we to evidence our own piecewise sample with another? Moreover, how could you invest 6-7 figures of marketing dollars if you didn\u2019t have the firsthand intelligence we gathered and our subject matter experts on deck to make constant adjustments to your approach?<\/p>\n<p>We were able to piece together trends we\u2019re seeing that point to increased download activity in recent months that surpass February\/March heights. We\u2019ve determined that the industry is back on track for growth with a less steep, but still growing, listenership trajectory. But even though more <a href=\"https:\/\/www.westwoodone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Westwood-Ones-Podcast-Download-Fall-2020-Report.pdf\">recent<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalpublicmedia.com\/insights\/reports\/npr-podcast-report\/\">reports<\/a> have been published, a longitudinal, objective resource has not yet emerged to show a majority of the industry\u2019s journey through one of the most disruptive media environments in recent history.<\/p>\n<p>There is a need for a new or existing entity to create cohesive data points; a third party that collects and reports listening across all major hosts and distribution points, or \u201cpodcatchers,\u201d as they\u2019re colloquially called. As a small example: Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to objectively track seasonal listening of news\/talk programming and schedule media planning and flighting around that? Or to know what the demographics of that audience look like compared to other verticals?<\/p>\n<p>What percentage increase in efficiency and\/or volume would you gain from your marketing efforts in the channel? Would that delta be profitable against paying a nominal or ongoing licensing or research fee for most brands?<\/p>\n<p>These challenges aren\u2019t just affecting advertisers. David Cohn, VP of Sales at Megaphone, agrees that \u201cfull transparency from the listening platforms would make our jobs easier, along with everyone else&#8217;s in the industry. We&#8217;d love to know how much of an episode is listened to, whether an ad is skipped, etc. Along the same lines, having a central source for [audience] measurement would be ideal \u2014 similar to what Nielsen has been for TV.\u201d This would also enable us to understand cross-show ad frequency, another black box for advertisers and the industry at large.<div

meaningful gaps in the knowledge collection and publication of podcast listening and engagement statistics. Coupled with still-developing advertising technology because of the distributed nature of the medium, this causes uncertainty in user consumption and ad exposure and impact. There is also a lot of misinformation and misconception about the challenges marketers face in these channels.<\/p>\n<p>All of this compounds to delay ad revenue growth for creators, publishers and networks by inhibiting new and scaling advertising investment, resulting in lost opportunity among all parties invested in the channel. There\u2019s a viable opportunity for a collective of industry professionals to collaborate on a solution for unified, free reporting, or a new business venture that collects and publishes more comprehensive data that ultimately promotes growth for podcast advertising.<\/p>\n<p>Podcasts have always had challenges when it comes to the analytics behind distribution, consumption and conversion. For an industry projected to exceed $1 billion in ad spend in 2021, it\u2019s impressive that it\u2019s built on RSS: A stable, but decades-old technology that literally means really simple syndication. Native to the technology is a one-way data flow, which democratizes the medium from a publishing perspective and makes it easy for creators to share content, but difficult for advertisers trying to measure performance and figure out where to invest ad dollars. This is compounded by a fractured creator, server and distribution\/endpoint environment unique to the medium.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tBecause podcasts lag other media channels in business intelligence, it\u2019s still an underinvested channel relative to its ability to reach consumers and impact purchasing behavior.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>For creators, podcasting has begun to normalize distribution analytics through a rising consolidation of hosts like <a href=\"https:\/\/art19.com\/\">Art19<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/megaphone.fm\/\">Megaphone<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/simplecast.com\/\">Simplecast<\/a>\u00a0and influence from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.iab.com\/guidelines\/podcast-measurement-guidelines\/\">IAB<\/a>. For advertisers, though, consumption and conversion analytics still lag far behind. For the high-growth tech companies we work with, and as performance marketers ourselves, measuring the return on investment of our ad spend is paramount.<\/p>\n<p>Because podcasts lag other media channels in business intelligence, it\u2019s still an underinvested channel relative to its ability to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.edisonresearch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/The-Infinite-Dial-2020-U.S.-Edison-Research.pdf\">reach<\/a> consumers and <a href=\"https:\/\/cdn.pdst.fm\/reports\/benchmarks\/podsights-july-2020-benchmark-report.pdf\">impact<\/a> purchasing behavior. This was evidenced when COVID-19 hit this year, as advertisers that were highly invested or highly interested in investing in podcast advertising asked a very basic question: \u201cIs COVID-19, and its associated lifestyle shifts, affecting podcast listening? If so, how?\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"DzTKD9YSDN\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/29\/voice-tech-in-2020\/\">Where is voice tech going?<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Where is voice tech going?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/29\/voice-tech-in-2020\/embed\/#?secret=DzTKD9YSDN\" data-secret=\"DzTKD9YSDN\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h2>The challenges of decentralized podcast ad data<\/h2>\n<p>We reached out to trusted partners to ask them for insights specific to their shows.<\/p>\n<p>Nick Southwell-Keely, U.S. director of Sales &amp; Brand Partnerships at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.acast.com\/\">Acast<\/a>, said: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing our highest listens ever even amid the pandemic. Across our portfolio, which includes more than 10,000 podcasts, our highest listening days in <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/acast\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"acast\">Acast <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> history have occurred in [July].\u201d Most partners provided similar anecdotes, but without centralized data, there was no one, singular firm to go to for an answer, nor one report to read that would cover 100% of the space. Almost more importantly, there is no third-party perspective to validate any of the anecdotal information shared with us.<\/p>\n<p>Publishers, agencies and firms all scrambled to answer the question. Even still, months later, we don\u2019t have a substantial and unifying update on exactly what, if anything, happened, or if it\u2019s still happening, channel-wide. Rather, we\u2019re still checking in across a wide swath of partners to identify and capitalize on microtrends. Contrast this to native digital channels like paid search and paid social, and connected, yet formerly \u201ctraditional\u201d media (e.g., TV, CTV\/OTT) that provide consolidated reports that marketers use to make decisions about their media investments.<\/p>\n<p>The lasting murkiness surrounding podcast media behavior during COVID-19 is just one <em>recent<\/em> case study on the challenges of a decentralized (or nonexistent) universal research vendor\/firm, and how it can affect advertisers\u2019 bottom lines. A more common illustration of this would be an advertiser pulling out of ads, for fear of underdelivery on a flat rate unit, missing out on incremental growth because they were worried about not being able to get download reporting and getting what they paid for. It\u2019s these kinds of basic shortcomings that the ad industry needs to account for before we can hit and exceed the ad revenue heights projected for podcasting.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tAdvertisers may pull out of campaigns for fear of under-delivery, missing out on incremental growth because they were worried about not getting what they paid for.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>If there\u2019s a silver lining to the uncertainty in podcast advertising metrics and intelligence, it\u2019s that supersavvy growth marketers have embraced the nascent medium and allowed it to do what it does best: personalized endorsements that drive conversions. While increased data will increase demand and corresponding ad premiums, for now, podcast advertising &#8220;veterans&#8221; are enjoying the relatively low profile of the space.<\/p>\n<p>As Ariana Martin, senior manager, Offline Growth Marketing at <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/babbel\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"babbel\">Babbel <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> notes, \u201cOn the other hand, podcast marketing, through host read ads, has something personal to it, which might change over time and across different podcasts. Because of this personal element, I am not sure if podcast marketing can ever be transformed into a pure data game. Once you get past the understanding that there is limited data in podcasting, it is actually very freeing as long as you\u2019re seeing a certain baseline of good results, [such as] sales attributed to podcast [advertising] via [survey based methodology], for example.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So how do we grow from the industry feeling like a secret game-changing channel for a select few brands, to widespread adoption across categories and industries?<\/p>\n<p>Below, we\u2019ve laid out the challenges of nonuniversal data within the podcast space, and how that hurts advertisers, publishers, third-party research\/tracking organizations, and broadly speaking, the podcast ecosystem. We\u2019ve also outlined the steps we\u2019re taking to make incremental solutions, and our vision for the industry moving forward.<\/p>\n<h2>Lingering misconceptions about podcast measurement<\/h2>\n<h3><strong>1. Download standardization<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>In search of a rationale to how such a buzzworthy growth channel lags behind more established media types\u2019 advertising revenue, many articles will point to \u201clistener\u201d or \u201cdownload\u201d numbers not being normalized. As far as we can tell at Right Side Up, where we power most of the scaled programs run by direct advertisers, making us a top three DR buying force in the industry, the majority of publishers have adopted the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.iab.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Podcast_Measurement_v2-Final-Dec2017.pdf\">IAB Podcast Measurement Technical Guidelines Version 2.0<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This widespread adoption solved the \u201capples to apples\u201d problem as it pertained to different networks\/shows valuing a variable, nonstandard \u201cdownload\u201d as an underlying component to their CPM calculations. Previous to this widespread adoption, it simply wasn\u2019t known whether a &#8220;download&#8221; from publisher X was equal to a &#8220;download&#8221; from publisher Y, making it difficult to aim for a particular CPM as a forecasting tool for performance marketing success.<\/p>\n<p>However, the IAB 2.0 guidelines don\u2019t completely solve the unique-user identification problem, as Dave Zohrob, CEO of <a href=\"https:\/\/chartable.com\/\">Chartable<\/a> points out. \u201cHaving some sort of anonymized user identifier to better calculate audience size would be fantastic \u2014\u00a0 the IAB guidelines offer a good approximation given the data we have but [it] would be great to actually know how many listeners are behind each IP\/user-agent combo.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><strong>2. Proof of ad delivery<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>A second area of business intelligence gaps that many articles point to as a cause of inhibited growth is a lack of \u201cproof of delivery.\u201d Ad impressions are unverifiable, and the channel doesn\u2019t have post logs, so for podcast advertisers the analogous evidence of spots running is access to \u201cairchecks,\u201d or audio clippings of the podcast ads themselves.<\/p>\n<p>Legacy podcast advertisers remember when a full-time team of entry-level staffers would hassle networks via phone or email for airchecks, sometimes not receiving verification that the spot had run until a week or more after the fact. This delay in the ability to accurately report spend hampered fast-moving performance marketers and gave the illusion of podcasts being a slow, stiff, immovable media type.<\/p>\n<p>Systematic aircheck collection has been a huge advent and allowed for an increase in confidence in the space \u2014 not only for spend verification, but also for creative compliance and optimization. Interestingly, this feature has come up almost as a byproduct of other development, as the companies who offer these services actually have different core business focuses: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.magellan.ai\/\">Magellan AI<\/a>, our preferred partner, is primarily a competitive intelligence platform, but pivoted to also offer airchecking services after realizing what a pain point it was for advertisers; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.veritone.com\/\">Veritone<\/a>, an AI company that\u2019s tied this service to its ad agency, Veritone One; and <a href=\"https:\/\/podsights.com\/\">Podsights<\/a>, a pixel-based attribution modeling solution.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>3. Competitive intelligence<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Last, competitive intelligence and media research continue to be a challenge. Magellan AI and Podsights offer a variety of fee and free tiers and methods of reporting to show a subset of the industry\u2019s activity. You can search a show, advertiser or category, and get a less-than-whole, but still directionally useful, picture of relevant podcast advertising activity. While not perfect, there are sufficient resources to at least see the tip of the industry iceberg as a consideration point to your business decision to enter podcasts or not.<\/p>\n<p>As Sean Creeley, founder of Podsights, aptly points out: \u201cWe give all Podsights research data, analysis, posts, etc. away for free because we want to help grow the space. If [a brand], as a DIY advertiser, desired to enter podcasting, it&#8217;s a downright daunting task. Research at least lets them understand what similar companies in their space are doing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There is also a nontech tool that publishers would find valuable. When we asked Shira Atkins, co-founder of Wonder Media Network, how she approaches research in the space, she had a not-at-all-surprising, but very refreshing response: \u201cTo be totally honest, the &#8216;research&#8217; I do is texting and calling the 3-5 really smart sales people I know and love in the space. The folks who were doing radio sales when I was still in high school, and the podcast people who recognize the messiness of it all, but have been successful at scaling campaigns that work for both the publisher and the advertiser. I wish there was a true tracker of cross-industry inventory &#8212; how much is sold versus unsold. The way I track the space writ large is by listening to a sample set of shows from top publishers to get a sense for how they&#8217;re selling and what their ads are like.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Even though podcast advertising is no longer limited by download standardization, spend verification and competitive research, there are still hurdles that the channel has not yet overcome.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<div

data-entity=\"andrew-young-2\">Andrew Young, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> the entertainer Michael Render (better known as Killer Mike) and Bounce TV founder Ryan Glover &#8212; have launched a <a href=\"https:\/\/bankgreenwood.com\/\">new digital bank<\/a> focused on developing and promoting local communities and cultivating Black and Latinx entrepreneurs and small businesses.<\/p>\n<p>Named Greenwood in an homage to the thriving Tulsa, Oklahoma, business community known as &#8220;Black Wall Street&#8221; that was destroyed by white rioters in 1921, the digital bank has several features designed to promote social causes and organizations for the Black and Latinx community.<\/p>\n<p>For every sign-up to the bank, Greenwood will donate the equivalent of five free meals to an organization addressing food insecurity. And every time a customer uses a Greenwood debit card, the bank will make a donation to either the <a href=\"https:\/\/uncf.org\/\">United Negro College Fund<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodr.co\/\">Goodr<\/a> (an organization that addresses food insecurity) or the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.naacp.org\/\">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People<\/a>.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>In addition, each month the bank will provide a $10,000 grant to a Black or Latinx small business owner that uses the company&#8217;s financial services.<\/p>\n<p>For Render, the decision to launch a new digital bank alongside Young and Glover was a way to link Atlanta&#8217;s well-established, centuries-old Black business community with the technologies that are redefining wealth and creating new opportunities in the twenty-first century. It was also a way to equip a new generation with financial tools that could empower them instead of undermine them.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;What I have learned about capitalism is that you&#8217;re either going to be a participant in it or a victim of it,&#8221; said Render. &#8220;The ultimate protest is focusing your dollar like a weapon.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Young, who is also the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, had seen the ways digital banking technologies were transforming the social order in countries like India &#8212; reducing the power of payday lenders and providing greater economic access &#8212; and wanted to bring those opportunities to communities in the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>Atlanta is a perfect home for a new Black-owned digital bank. After riots in 1906 destroyed Atlanta&#8217;s own bustling Black business district in a prelude to the Greenwood Massacre 15 years later, the community rebuilt with banks like Citizen&#8217;s Trust (founded in 1921) and Carver (founded in 1946) serving the city&#8217;s Black community.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"lxjQlZMbfj\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/05\/mozper-launches-digital-banking-service-for-latin-american-parents-and-kids\/\">Mozper launches digital banking service for Latin American parents and kids<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Mozper launches digital banking service for Latin American parents and kids&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/05\/mozper-launches-digital-banking-service-for-latin-american-parents-and-kids\/embed\/#?secret=lxjQlZMbfj\" data-secret=\"lxjQlZMbfj\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Rendon, a serial entrepreneur who owns a chain of barber shops called the SWAG Shop, some real estate and a restaurant along with the rapper T.I., said that he&#8217;s not just a founder of Greenwood, he&#8217;ll soon become a customer.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Today, a dollar circulates for 20 days in the white community but only six hours in the Black community,&#8221; said Render in a statement. &#8220;Moreover, a Black person is twice as likely as a white person to be denied a mortgage. This lack of fairness in the financial system is why we created Greenwood.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Greenwood will offer a physical debit card and savings and checking accounts to its customers &#8212; along with all of the digital features one would expect, including integrations with Apple, Samsung and Google Pay, the ability to make peer-to-peer payments, mobile checking deposits and free ATM usage at over 30,000 locations.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no secret that traditional banks have failed the Black and Latinx community,&#8221; said Glover, in a statement. &#8220;We needed to create a new financial platform that understands our history and our needs going forward, a banking platform built by us and for us, a platform that helps us build a stronger future for our communities. This is our time to take back control of our lives and our financial future.

href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/assistant\/hey-google-now-works-your-android-apps\/\">announced<\/a> it&#8217;s making it possible to use the voice command &#8220;Hey Google&#8221; to not just open but also perform specific tasks within Android apps. The feature will be rolled out to all Google Assistant-enabled Android phones, allowing users to launch apps with their voice as well as search inside apps or perform specific tasks &#8212; like ordering food, playing music, posting to social media, hailing a ride and more.<\/p>\n<p>For example, users could say something like, &#8220;Hey Google, search cozy blankets on Etsy,&#8221; &#8220;open Selena Gomez on Snapchat,&#8221; &#8220;start my run with Nike Run Club,&#8221; or &#8220;check news on <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/twitter\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"twitter\">Twitter <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>At launch, Google says these sorts of voice commands will work with more than 30 of the top apps on Google Play in English globally, with more apps coming soon. Some of the supported apps today include Spotify, Snapchat, Twitter, Walmart, Discord, Etsy, MyFitnessPal, Mint, Nike Adapt, Nike Run Club, eBay, Kroger and Postmates, Wayfair, to name a few.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>If the specific voice command you would use to perform a common task is a little clumsy, the feature will also allow you to create a custom shortcut phrase instead. That means, instead of saying &#8220;Hey Google, tighten my shoes with Nike Adapt,&#8221; you could create a command that just said, &#8220;Hey Google, lace it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>To get started with shortcuts, Android users can say &#8220;Hey Google, show my shortcuts&#8221; to get to the correct Settings screen.<\/p>\n<p>The feature is similar to Apple&#8217;s support for using Siri with iOS apps, which also includes the ability to open apps, perform tasks and record your own custom phrase.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"hpeH2KsurH\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/08\/googles-new-verified-calls-feature-will-tell-you-why-a-business-is-calling-you\/\">Google&#8217;s new &#8216;Verified Calls&#8217; feature will tell you why a business is calling you<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Google&#8217;s new &#8216;Verified Calls&#8217; feature will tell you why a business is calling you&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/08\/googles-new-verified-calls-feature-will-tell-you-why-a-business-is-calling-you\/embed\/#?secret=hpeH2KsurH\" data-secret=\"hpeH2KsurH\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>In Google&#8217;s case, the ability to perform tasks inside an app is implemented on the developer&#8217;s side <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/assistant\/app\/overview\">by mapping users&#8217; intents<\/a> to specific functionality inside their apps. This feature, known as App Actions, allows users to open their favorite apps with a voice command &#8212; and, with the added functionality, lets users say &#8220;Hey Google&#8221; to search within the app or open specific app pages.<\/p>\n<p>Google <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.googleblog.com\/2020\/10\/google-assistant-developer-day-new.html\">says<\/a> it has grown its catalog to include more than 60 intents across 10 verticals, including Finance, Ridesharing, Food Ordering, Fitness and, now, Social, Games, Travel &amp; Local, Productivity, Shopping and Communications, too.<\/p>\n<p>To help users understand how and when they can use these new App Actions, Google says it&#8217;s building touchpoints in Android that will help them learn when they use certain voice commands. For instance, if a user said &#8220;Hey Google, show me Taylor Swift,&#8221; it may highlight a suggestion chip that will guide the users to opening the search result on Twitter.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2058366\" style=\"width: 332px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2058366\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical size-large wp-image-2058366\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Taylor-Swift-Sep-1-745PM.mp4.gif?w=322\" alt=\"\" width=\"322\" height=\"680\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2058366\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Google<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Related to this news, Google <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.googleblog.com\/2020\/10\/google-assistant-developer-day-new.html\">says<\/a> it also released two new English voices for developers to leverage when building custom experiences for Assistant on Smart Displays, alongside <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.googleblog.com\/2020\/10\/google-assistant-developer-day-new.html\">other developer tools<\/a> and resources for those building for displays.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"sFruJYH00y\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/30\/the-new-google-tv-brings-streaming-apps-live-tv-and-search-into-a-single-interface\/\">The new Google TV brings streaming apps, live TV and search into a single interface<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;The new Google TV brings streaming apps, live TV and search into a single interface&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/30\/the-new-google-tv-brings-streaming-apps-live-tv-and-search-into-a-single-interface\/embed\/#?secret=sFruJYH00y\" data-secret=\"sFruJYH00y\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The Google Assistant upgrade for apps was <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/android\/new-features-fall-2020\">one of several Android improvements Google highlighted today<\/a>.

employee onboarding and exiting, and today they are expanding into a broader set of IT services.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our vision when starting a company was really that IT is being redefined in the age of SaaS. So step one was to help with everything around managing SaaS. And step two is what does that mean in terms of the broader IT management vision,&#8221; Diaz told TechCrunch.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/blissfully\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"blissfully\">Blissfully <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> believed that SaaS was going to take a bigger and bigger part of IT in terms of mindshare, spend and how you manage it, and they turned out to be right.

In addition, they are adding role-based access control to allow different people access to various IT management services, which is increasingly essential during the pandemic as people are being forced to troubleshoot and manage various IT issues from home. Finally, the startup is opening up its APIs so that IT can tap into that and build customized functionality or workflows on top of the Blissfully platform.<\/p>\n<p>Diaz believes that the company has reached a point of maturity when it comes to SaaS management, and they saw a need in the midmarket to provide these additional IT services that larger organizations tend to get from a company like ServiceNow.<\/p>\n<p>The new services will be available starting today from Blissfully.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"GAueQcAKHl\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/10\/01\/why-blissfully-decided-to-go-all-in-on-serverless\/\">Why Blissfully decided to go all in on serverless<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Why Blissfully decided to go all in on serverless&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/10\/01\/why-blissfully-decided-to-go-all-in-on-serverless\/embed\/#?secret=GAueQcAKHl\" data-secret=\"GAueQcAKHl\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When Blissfully launched in 2016, it was focused on helping companies understand their SaaS usage inside their organizations, but over time the company has seen that there is a wider need, especially in midmarket companies, and today it announced it was expanding into broader IT management.

Palmieri suggested that one reason for this is the fragmentation of their tools and data.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If you\u2019re selling something like Campbell&#8217;s Soup, you want to figure out, how is your tomato soup business and your chicken soup business?&#8221; Palmieri said. &#8220;Today, brands are saying, &#8216;How\u2019s my <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/amazon\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"amazon\">Amazon <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> business?

Palmieri suggested that in some cases (like ad-buying), Tradeswell will replace existing software, while in other cases it will integrate.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Think of us as a neural AI layer, where [a brand] might have different platform relationships, which are the fingers, and we&#8217;re the AI brain,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re giving brands insights and forecasts: If you make this change, we anticipate XYZ will happen.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In some cases, like the aforementioned advertising, Tradeswell can also support full automation, so that merchants don&#8217;t have to worry about &#8220;setting up and tearing down hundreds of campaigns.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The key, Palmieri said, is that the platform has access to the business&#8217; full financials, so it can optimize for net margins, rather than simply driving the most impressions or clicks or sales.<\/p>\n<p>While Tradeswell is only coming out of stealth mode today, it&#8217;s already been working with more than 100 brands. For example, Steve Tracy of Red Monkey Foods and San Francisco Salt Company said in a statement that the startup&#8217;s &#8220;unique, comprehensive, algorithmic approach has helped us grow sales, identify commercialization opportunities and forecast far more accurately.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"OjhwUVrDvq\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/09\/03\/aol-acquires-millennial-media\/\">AOL Confirms It Is Buying Millennial Media In $238M Deal To Expand In Mobile Ads<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;AOL Confirms It Is Buying Millennial Media In $238M Deal To Expand In Mobile Ads&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/09\/03\/aol-acquires-millennial-media\/embed\/#?secret=OjhwUVrDvq\" data-secret=\"OjhwUVrDvq\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A new startup called Tradeswell said it&#8217;s using artificial intelligence to help direct-to-consumer and e-commerce brands build healthier businesses.

featuring prior investors. D1 Capital and Valiant Peregrine Fund led the investment. Instacart is now worth $17.7 billion, post-money, or $17.5 billion pre-money. The plan is to use the funding to focus on introducing new features and tools to improve the customer experience, and further support Instacart&#8217;s enterprise and ads businesses, <a href=\"https:\/\/news.instacart.com\/instacart-announces-new-funding-from-valiant-peregrine-fund-and-d1-capital-partners-21350dc9467\">according to a blog post<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Previously in 2020, Instacart <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/scoop-instacart-adds-100-million-1ffe5a05-a3d1-4521-a5d3-ffd44aa38d02.html\">raised $100 million in July<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/news.crunchbase.com\/news\/instacart-pushes-its-way-to-a-13-7b-valuation-with-new-225m-funding-round\/\">$225 million in June<\/a>. The June round valued the company at around $13.7 billion, meaning that the unicorn&#8217;s new funding round &#8212; raised just months later &#8212; came at a much higher price.<\/p>\n<p>Instacart, like some other tech, and tech-enabled businesses, has seen demand for its service expand during the pandemic. It&#8217;s not hard to trace a connection between COVID-19 and its business results, as folks wanting to stay at home have turned to on-demand services to keep themselves safe.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/06\/ubers-delivery-business-is-now-larger-than-ride-hailing\/\">growth shown by Uber&#8217;s food delivery business<\/a> is another example of this trend.<\/p>\n<p>Instacart&#8217;s valuation has more than doubled since its 2018 Series F, when it was worth around $7.9 billion. The pace at which Instacart has created paper value is impressive, though its IPO plans appear murky from the outside and how much of its COVID-bump will be retained when the pandemic ends is not yet clear.<\/p>\n<p>The startup famously turned a profit during a month in Q2, worth around $10 million <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theinformation.com\/articles\/instacart-swings-to-first-profit-as-pandemic-fuels-surge-in-grocery-delivery\">per The Information<\/a>. The same report indicated that Instacart lost around $300 million in 2019.

Of all the measures on this November\u2019s ballot, Yes on Prop 22 has received the most contributions, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fppc.ca.gov\/transparency\/top-contributors\/nov-20-gen.html\">according to California\u2019s Fair Political Practices Commission<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond Prop 22, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/27\/instacart-faces-lawsuit-from-dc-attorney-general-over-deceptive-service-fees\/\">Instacart is facing a lawsuit<\/a> from Washington, D.C. District Attorney General Karl A. Racine that alleges the company charged customers millions of dollars in \u201cdeceptive service fees\u201d and failed to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of sales tax. The suit seeks restitution for customers who paid those service fees, as well as back taxes and interest on taxes owed to D.C.

self-driving-project-turned-Alphabet unit, is beginning to open up its driverless ride-hailing service to the public.<\/p>\n<p>The company said that starting today, members of its Waymo One service will be able to take family and friends along on their fully driverless rides in the Phoenix area. Existing Waymo One members will have the first access to the driverless rides \u2014 terminology that means no human behind the wheel. However, the company said that in the next several weeks more people will be welcomed directly into the service through its app, which is available on Google Play and the App Store.<\/p>\n<p>Waymo said that 100% of its rides will be fully driverless \u2014 which it has deemed its &#8220;rider only&#8221; mode. That 100% claim requires a bit of unpacking. The public shouldn&#8217;t expect hundreds of Waymo-branded Chrysler Pacifica minivans \u2014 no human behind the wheel \u2014 to suddenly inundate the entire 600-plus square miles of the greater Phoenix area.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Waymo has abut 600 vehicles in its fleet. About 300 to 400 of those are in the Phoenix area. Waymo wouldn&#8217;t share exact numbers of how many of these vehicles would be dedicated to driverless rides. However, Waymo CEO <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/john-krafcik\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"john-krafcik\">John Krafcik <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> explained to TechCrunch in a recent interview that there will be various modes operating in the Phoenix area. Some of these will be &#8220;rider only,&#8221; while other vehicles will still have trained safety operators behind the wheel. Some of the fleet will also be used for testing.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re just ready from every standpoint,&#8221; Krafcik told TechCrunch.\u00a0&#8220;And how do we know we&#8217;re ready? We&#8217;ve had our wonderful group of early riders, who&#8217;ve helped us hone the service, obviously not from a safety standpoint because we&#8217;ve had the confidence on the safety side for some time, but rather more for the fit of the product itself.&#8221; He added that these early riders helped the company determine if the product was &#8220;delivering satisfaction and delight for them.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Later this year, Waymo will relaunch rides with a trained vehicle operator to add capacity and allow us to serve a larger geographical area. Krafcik said the company is in the process of adding in-vehicle barriers between the front row and rear passenger cabin for in-vehicle hygiene and safety.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"xEEyuDvail\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/02\/waymo-brings-in-2-25-billion-from-outside-investors-alphabet\/\">Waymo brings in $2.25 billion from outside investors, Alphabet<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Waymo brings in $2.25 billion from outside investors, Alphabet&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/02\/waymo-brings-in-2-25-billion-from-outside-investors-alphabet\/embed\/#?secret=xEEyuDvail\" data-secret=\"xEEyuDvail\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Waymo operates in about a 100-square-mile area.

The past five years has been particularly packed, starting with Steve Mahan, who is legally blind, taking the &#8220;first: driverless ride in the company\u2019s Firefly prototype on <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/waymo\/scenes-from-the-street-5bb77046d7ce\">Austin\u2019s city streets<\/a> in 2015. More than a dozen journalists experienced driverless rides in 2017 on a closed course at Waymo\u2019s testing facility in Castle. Then last November, TechCrunch took one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/01\/hailing-a-driverless-ride-in-a-waymo\/\">first driverless rides in a Waymo Pacifica minivan<\/a> along the public streets of a Phoenix suburb.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/waymo-driverless-app.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2058182 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/waymo-driverless-app.jpg\" alt=\"waymo-driverless app\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/waymo-driverless-app.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/waymo-driverless-app.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/waymo-driverless-app.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/waymo-driverless-app.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/waymo-driverless-app.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/waymo-driverless-app.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/waymo-driverless-app.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The company scaled its commercial product even as these demos and testing continued. In 2017, Waymo launched its early rider program, which let vetted members of the public, who had signed non-disclosure agreements, hail its self-driving cars in the Phoenix area. Those autonomous vehicles all had human safety operators behind the wheel.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"avjOUJXwc9\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/01\/hailing-a-driverless-ride-in-a-waymo\/\">Hailing a driverless ride in a Waymo<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Hailing a driverless ride in a Waymo&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/01\/hailing-a-driverless-ride-in-a-waymo\/embed\/#?secret=avjOUJXwc9\" data-secret=\"avjOUJXwc9\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Waymo then launched Waymo One, a self-driving ride-hailing service aimed for public use, no NDA strings attached. But again, those rides all had human safety operators in the driver&#8217;s seat, ready to take over if needed. Waymo slowly moved its early rider program members into the more open Waymo One service. It also started experimenting with charging for rides and expanded its footprint &#8212; or geofenced service area. Today, the company charges for rides across all of its programs (early rider and Waymo One) in the Phoenix area. The Waymo One service (with human safety operators) is about 100 square miles in Phoenix suburbs like Chandler.<\/p>\n<p>The first meaningful signs that Waymo was ready to put people in vehicles without human safety operators popped up last fall when members of its early rider program received an email indicating that driverless rides would soon become available.<\/p>\n<p>And they did. These driverless rides were limited and free. And importantly, still fell under the early rider program, which had that extra NDA protection. Waymo slowly scaled until about 5 to 10% of its total rides in 2020 were fully driverless for its exclusive group of early riders under NDA. Then COVID-19 hit and the service was halted. The company has continued testing with its safety drivers in Arizona and California. That has raised some concerns among those workers about the dual issue of catching COVID and dealing with air quality issues caused by wildfires in California.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"tYIcGa66io\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/21\/hailing-a-self-driving-taxi-when-blind-learn-how-waymo-answers-that-challenge-at-sight-tech-global\/\">Hailing a self-driving taxi when blind.
