				<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="http://blissfully.com">Blissfully</a> launched in 2016, it was focused on helping companies understand their SaaS usage inside their organizations, but over time the company has seen that there is a wider need, especially in midmarket companies, and today it announced it was expanding into broader IT management.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/ariel-diaz" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="ariel-diaz">Ariel Diaz <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> says that the startup began helping to track SaaS usage, eventually expanding into employee onboarding and exiting, and today they are expanding into a broader set of IT services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our vision when starting a company was really that IT is being redefined in the age of SaaS. So step one was to help with everything around managing SaaS. And step two is what does that mean in terms of the broader IT management vision,&#8221; Diaz told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/blissfully" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="blissfully">Blissfully <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> believed that SaaS was going to take a bigger and bigger part of IT in terms of mindshare, spend and how you manage it, and they turned out to be right. Now, they felt the time is right to expand their original idea to encompass more of the IT management function.</p>

<p>That has resulted in a newly expanded platform they are releasing today that not only includes the earlier SaaS management components that it&#8217;s been providing all along, but also four other new categories.</p>
<p>For starters they are offering IT asset management. &#8220;We are now offering the ability to track not just SaaS applications, but all your IT assets, including hardware devices and traditional software,&#8221; Diaz said.</p>
<p>Next, they are including help desk management and ticketing capabilities to handle requests that fall outside of their SaaS management workflows. In addition, they are adding role-based access control to allow different people access to various IT management services, which is increasingly essential during the pandemic as people are being forced to troubleshoot and manage various IT issues from home. Finally, the startup is opening up its APIs so that IT can tap into that and build customized functionality or workflows on top of the Blissfully platform.</p>
<p>Diaz believes that the company has reached a point of maturity when it comes to SaaS management, and they saw a need in the midmarket to provide these additional IT services that larger organizations tend to get from a company like ServiceNow.</p>
<p>The new services will be available starting today from Blissfully.</p>

Individuals involved in the plot organized across Facebook groups, in-person events and at least two encrypted chat apps that the FBI did not name.<\/p>\n<p>Whitmer, a Democrat, became a major target of pervasive anti-lockdown sentiment on the political right earlier this year when states imposed restrictions to slow the spread of the coronavirus. According to the affidavit, at a June in-person meeting, members of the group &#8220;talked about murdering &#8216;tyrants&#8217; or &#8216;taking&#8217; a sitting governor.&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/opa\/pr\/six-arrested-federal-charge-conspiracy-kidnap-governor-michigan\">Thirteen people<\/a> have been charged in relation to the kidnapping plot.<\/p>\n<p>The group grew its numbers after contacting a Michigan-based militia known as the Wolverine Watchmen that shared overlapping interests.

Just this week, Facebook announced both a broader ban on the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/06\/facebook-qanon-ban\/\">pro-Trump conspiracy known as QAnon<\/a> and a new policy for <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/07\/facebook-poll-watching-trump-election-political-ads\/\">voter intimidation efforts<\/a> that use militaristic language.<\/p>\n<p>When asked if the terror plot had an impact on the company&#8217;s recent spate of surprising policy changes, Facebook did not provide a direct response. It&#8217;s also not clear if the domestic terror plot used Facebook groups to recruit and connect online or just to communicate among members who already knew each other in real life.<\/p>\n<p>Researchers who study extremism have long expressed concerns that Facebook&#8217;s algorithmic recommendations can push users toward dangerous ideas \u2014 and dangerous behavior.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"NTb75g00Jo\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/06\/facebook-qanon-ban\/\">Facebook says it will ban QAnon across its platforms<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Facebook says it will ban QAnon across its platforms&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/06\/facebook-qanon-ban\/embed\/#?secret=NTb75g00Jo\" data-secret=\"NTb75g00Jo\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Militias and other kinds of domestic extremist groups have increasingly leaned on Facebook for recruitment in recent years. Once members are connected and vetted, often through public groups, they are allowed into an inner circle, sometimes in the form of a private Facebook group. The Proud Boys, a violent far-right group with ties to white supremacists, were <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/08\/10\/proud-boys-facebook-mcinnes\/\">a prominent example<\/a> of this recruitment strategy.<\/p>\n<p>Users can be ushered into these extremist groups by Facebook&#8217;s algorithmic suggestions, which previously appeared in a box next to a group&#8217;s activity. For Facebook pages, those suggestions still appear to the side of the main stream of content, directing users toward &#8220;related pages.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Facebook <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/10\/30\/facebook-proud-boys-mcinnes-kicked-off\/\">banned the Proud Boys<\/a> from its platform in late 2018. But groups interested in violence that kept a lower profile have maintained a large presence on the platform well into 2020, including a number of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adl.org\/resources\/glossary-terms\/patriot-movement\">state &#8220;patriot&#8221; organizations<\/a> and anti-government <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/2020\/6\/8\/21276911\/boogaloo-explained-civil-war-protests\">boogaloo groups<\/a> that coordinate firearm and combat trainings through the platform.<\/p>\n<p>In June, Facebook <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/30\/facebook-boogaloo-ban\/\">banned a &#8220;violent network&#8221; of boogaloo groups<\/a>, but other groups remain, organizing under code words related to the boogaloo movement.

a boom in SPACs, few women investors"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">If you&#8217;ve been following the SPAC boom, you may have noticed something about these blank-check vehicles that are springing up left and right in order to take public privately held companies. They are being organized mostly by men.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not surprising, given the relative dearth of women in senior financial positions in banking and the venture industry. But it also begs the question of whether women, already hustling to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/outlook\/2019\/04\/02\/america-doesnt-just-have-gender-pay-gap-it-has-gender-wealth-gap\/\">overcome a wealth gap<\/a>, could be left behind if the trend gains momentum.<\/p>\n<p>Consider that <a href=\"https:\/\/pitchbook.com\/media\/press-releases\/pitchbook-all-raise-report-on-venture-financing-in-female-founded-startups-shows-progress-yet-continued-gender-inequity\">studies<\/a> have shown women investors are are twice as likely to invest in startups with at least one female founder, and more than three times as likely to invest in startups with female CEOs. It&#8217;s not a huge leap to imagine that women-led SPACs might also be more inclined to identify women-led companies with which to merge and take public.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>SPAC sponsors can reap handsome rewards, too. In return for lining up investors, then persuading a target company to accept the terms it offers them, sponsors typically receive 25% of the SPACs founder shares, which can mean a lot of money in a short amount of time, given that SPACs typically aim to merge with a company in two years or less. In fact, even if the SPAC performs terribly &#8212; say the company with which it merges is later <a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/NKLA\/chart\/\">accused of fraud<\/a> &#8212; those sponsors get paid.<\/p>\n<p>Eventbrite cofounder Kevin Hartz, who is overseeing a $200 million SPAC, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/21\/almost-everything-you-need-to-know-about-spacs\/\">explained it to us<\/a> in August this way: &#8220;On a $200 million SPAC, there\u2019s a $50 million \u2018promote\u2019 that is earned.\u201d But \u201cif that company doesn\u2019t perform and, say, drops in half over a year or 18-month period, then the shares are still worth $25 million. (Hartz himself called this guaranteed payout \u201cegregious,\u201d though he and his partner in the SPAC, Troy Steckenrider, didn&#8217;t structure their SPAC differently, saying that as a first-time SPAC sponsor, they wanted to keep things straightforward.)<\/p>\n<p>Women aren&#8217;t entirely unaccounted for in the current SPAC craze. Thanks to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sos.ca.gov\/business-programs\/women-boards\">state law<\/a> passed in California in 2018, nearly all SPACs based in California have a female director, as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/spac-california-gender-rule-6ba4d12b-c310-4670-aa8e-ecc0ccf8838e.html\">reported earlier by Axios<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In the last two weeks, at least three SPACs to register with the SEC have been launched exclusively or in part by sponsors who are women. Hope Taiz, a New York-based investor who began her investment banking career at Drexel Burnham Lambert, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.renaissancecapital.com\/IPO-Center\/News\/71991\/Growth-focused-SPAC-Aequi-Acquisition-files-for-a-$300-million-IPO\">registered plans<\/a> this week with the SEC to raise a $300 million blank-check company called Aequi Acquisition.<\/p>\n<p>Northern Star Acquisition, a consumer-focused SPAC co-led by magazine vet Joanna Coles, meanwhile filed for a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/consumer-focused-spac-northern-star-acquisition-files-for-a-%24300-million-ipo-2020-09-29\">$300 million IPO<\/a> last week, and Climate Change Crisis Real Impact I Acquisition, a SPAC focused on climate technology, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.renaissancecapital.com\/IPO-Center\/News\/71711\/Climate-Change-Crisis-Real-Impact-I-Acquisition-a-SPAC-led-by-the-former-CE\">raised $200 million <\/a>in an <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/ipo\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"ipo\">IPO <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>. The blank check company is co-led by Mary Powell, the former CEO of Green Mountain Power.<\/p>\n<p>One SPAC sponsor &#8212; Betsy Cohen, a founder and former CEO of the financial services company Bancorp &#8212; has really taken to SPACs, establishing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crowdfundinsider.com\/2020\/09\/165777-spac-bancorp-founder-betsy-cohens-new-750-million-special-purpose-acquisition-company-to-acquire-fintech-business\/\">four fintech-related shell firms<\/a> so far, the most recent of which raised $750 million last month. (As an interesting aside, the SPAC programs of both <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gL6_L9vxIRU\">Goldman Sachs<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/tinapappas\/\">Jefferies<\/a> are led by women.)<\/p>\n<p>Given these developments, some might wonder &#8212; reasonably &#8212; if it isn&#8217;t a little early to worry about women missing out on this apparent gold rush. Still, women-led SPACs represent a tiny percentage of the 133 SPACs that have raised more than $50 billion in proceeds this year at last count.<\/p>\n<p>More, the only tech <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">investors to jump into the pool to date are exclusively men, including Chamath Palihapitiya of Social Capital (who has <\/span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/cant-stop-wont-stop-social-capital-hedosophia-just-filed-for-its-fourth-spac-says-new-report\/\">dozens<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> of SPACs in mind); Hartz and Steckenrider; entrepreneur-investors <\/span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/09\/18\/business\/dealbook\/hoffman-pincus-spac.html\">Reid Hoffman and Mark Pincus<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">, Ribbit Capital&#8217;s <\/span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.renaissancecapital.com\/IPO-Center\/News\/70579\/Ribbit-Capitals-fintech-SPAC-Ribbit-LEAP-files-for-a-$350-million-IPO\">Mickey Malka<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">; former Uber executive <\/span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/02\/controversial-former-uber-exec-emil-michael-has-registered-plans-for-a-250-million-spac\/\">Emil Michael<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">; and the founders of <\/span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.renaissancecapital.com\/IPO-Center\/News\/71979\/FirstMark-Capitals-tech-SPAC-FirstMark-Horizon-Acquisition-prices-upsized-$\">FirstMark Capital<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>It isn&#8217;t that their female counterparts aren&#8217;t paying attention, seemingly. A number of top women VCs with whom we&#8217;ve talked say they&#8217;re following the action and weighing how to participate. One such prominent investor told us she&#8217;s been researching under what circumstances it makes sense for VC firms to engage in a SPAC&#8217;s origination.<\/p>\n<p>Others may be looking to gain exposure first to SPACs through their portfolio companies. Dana Grayson of Construct Capital, for example, led an early investment in the 3D printing company <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/desktop-metal\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"desktop-metal\">Desktop Metal <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> &#8212; which is <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/26\/desktop-metal-going-public-in-spac-led-deal-that-could-value-3d-printer-company-at-2-5b\/\">going public through a SPAC-led deal<\/a> &#8212;\u00a0 while a partner the firm NEA. At TechCrunch&#8217;s recent Disrupt event, Grayson, speaking about Desktop Metal, called SPACs a &#8220;great new <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/21\/a-meeting-room-of-ones-own-three-vcs-discuss-breaking-out-of-big-firms-to-found-their-own-gigs\/\">viable alternative<\/a> for companies.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Either way, observes Kristi Marvin, a former investment banker who now runs the data site <a href=\"https:\/\/spacinsider.com\/\">SPACInsider<\/a>, it&#8217;s not time to panic, she suggests.<\/p>\n<p>For one thing, as with &#8220;most banking things, SPACs skew heavily male,&#8221; so it&#8217;s to be expected that many more men are sponsoring SPACs. The SPAC market is also on the verge of overheating, based on what she is seeing. &#8220;You have 10 deals trying to price in the same day, and investors are tapped out.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>SPACs also require a learning curve that some underestimate. &#8220;It&#8217;s why you see hedge funds and PE firms more involved in SPACs; they have infrastructure to do them versus three guys who are facing a ton of work just to do the administrative side of things,&#8221; notes Marvin.<\/p>\n<p>As with other financial products, Marvin expects to see more women embrace SPACs over time, especially if they prove to be as durable as many early adherents suggest. That said, she adds, &#8220;If in a year or two, it&#8217;s still only male VCs who&#8217;ve dipped their toe into SPACs, it may be a problem.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you&#8217;ve been following the SPAC boom, you may have noticed something about these blank-check vehicles that are springing up left and right in order to take public privately held companies.

target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"affirm\">Affirm, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> a startup focused on providing point-of-sale credit to consumers making online purchases, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.affirm.com\/press\/releases\/affirm-announces-confidential-submission-of-draft-registration-statement\">announced that it has filed to go public<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The filing is confidential, so there&#8217;s little to be gleaned about the company&#8217;s performance from the news. That Affirm was exploring a public offering was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/affirm-prepares-ipo-that-could-value-fintech-firm-at-up-to-10-billion-11596143292\">reported by the Wall Street Journal back in July<\/a>. In the aftermath of that news, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/31\/working-to-understand-affirms-reported-ipo-pricing-hopes\/\">TechCrunch tried to understand the valuation<\/a> that Affirm was said to be targeting in its debut, which we placed at as much as $10 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Affirm has been richly funded throughout its private life. The fintech unicorn has raised private funds in excess of $1 billion, including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/funding_round\/affirm-series-g--8369cd0e\">a $500 million Series G in September of 2020<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/funding_round\/affirm-series-f--87997e72\">a $300 million Series F in April of 2019<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/funding_round\/affirm-series-e--ce60ebc2\">a $200 million Series E in December of 2017<\/a>. Affirm also raised more than $400 million in earlier equity rounds, and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/10\/13\/levchins-affirm-secures-100m-credit-line-from-morgan-stanley\/\">a $100 million debt line in late 2016<\/a>.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Many venture bets are therefore riding on the success of Affirm and its future liquidity.<\/p>\n<p>The company was valued at $2.9 billion at the time of its $300 million Series F last year according <a href=\"http:\/\/pitchbook.com\">to PitchBook data<\/a>. The company&#8217;s most recent valuation is not known. How much of a step-up a $10 billion public valuation would be, therefore, from its final private valuation is not clear.<\/p>\n<p>Affirm will enter warm public markets if it chooses to list in short-order. The third quarter of 2020 was a bonanza of public-market liquidity, as the United States saw its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pwc.com\/us\/en\/services\/deals\/capital-markets-watch-quarterly.html\">most active quarter of public offerings since at least 2016<\/a>, partially driven by the craze around SPACs. With retail investors and larger checkbooks alike active in their interest for growth-focused shares, unprofitable tech startups have done well in their recent debuts.<\/p>\n<p>Those that make money have done even better, certain outliers like Snowflake aside.<\/p>\n<p>After a confidential filing, Affirm will wait to hear back from the SEC on its application, and then will have the choice to file a nonconfidential S-1 when it is ready. There is no set timeline here, but once the company&#8217;s numbers are public, we&#8217;ll be diving into them. Affirm joins other recent companies like Palantir who filed their public offerings confidentially first, before later making them public.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"XDakEQF1cA\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/31\/working-to-understand-affirms-reported-ipo-pricing-hopes\/\">Working to understand Affirm&#8217;s reported IPO pricing hopes<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Working to understand Affirm&#8217;s reported IPO pricing hopes&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/31\/working-to-understand-affirms-reported-ipo-pricing-hopes\/embed\/#?secret=XDakEQF1cA\" data-secret=\"XDakEQF1cA\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This afternoon Affirm, a startup focused on providing point-of-sale credit to consumers making online purchases, announced that it has filed to go public.

vacation, so <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dannycrichton\">Danny<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/alex\">your humble servant<\/a> had to endeavor alone. She&#8217;s back next week, so we&#8217;ll be back to full strength as a collective soon enough.<\/p>\n<p>But even with a depleted hosting crew, we had a mountain of news to get through. And to joke about, as Danny was in the mood for a laugh. Here&#8217;s the rundown:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/reddit-cofounder-alexis-ohanians-new-venture-fund-invests-in-disposable-camera-app-11602072245\">Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian\u2019s New Venture Fund Invests in Disposable Camera App<\/a>: Danny and I are arbiters of what is cool, so we were the perfect pair to discuss influencers and new social applications. This one is actually neat, and Ohanian&#8217;s inclusion in the investment viz his new fund was noteworthy.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/07\/zira-raises-3-1m-for-its-shift-scheduling-service-that-helps-manage-hourly-workers\/\">Zira raises $3.1M for its shift-scheduling service that helps manage hourly workers<\/a>: This is a round that I covered, looking into <a href=\"http:\/\/zira.ai\">Zira.ai<\/a> and its product. Our take? It&#8217;s neat, but operates in a competitive market.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/07\/shogun-raises-35m-to-help-brands-take-on-amazon-with-faster-and-better-sites-of-their-own\/\">Shogun raises $35M to help brands take on Amazon with faster and better sites of their own<\/a>: This is a similar story. A neat company with a neat product in a space where there is proven demand (TAM, in other words), and competition.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/07\/unqorks-207m-series-c-underscores-growing-enterprise-demand-for-no-code-apps\/\">Unqork&#8217;s $207M Series C underscores growing enterprise demand for no-code apps<\/a>: Another round worth mentioning is the Unqork deal. Unqork is a no-code service that helps other businesses create apps for their companies. It&#8217;s growing like a weed, and is thus something worth knowing a bit about.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/alexkonrad\/2020\/10\/07\/video-startup-mmhmm-raises-31-million-pre-launch\/#1c49e2c1bcc2\">Mmhmm, Five-Month-Old Video Startup Making Virtual Meetings More Fun, Raises $31 Million Pre-Launch<\/a>: Yes, mmhmm has raised more money, and, we&#8217;re excited to learn, could be launching this very month.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/06\/remotion-raises-13m-to-create-a-workplace-video-platform-for-short-spontaneous-conversations\/\">Remotion raises $13M to create a workplace video platform for short, spontaneous conversations<\/a>: Following the Slack news, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/06\/remotion-raises-13m-to-create-a-workplace-video-platform-for-short-spontaneous-conversations\/\">this round stood out to us<\/a>.

employee onboarding and exiting, and today they are expanding into a broader set of IT services.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our vision when starting a company was really that IT is being redefined in the age of SaaS. So step one was to help with everything around managing SaaS. And step two is what does that mean in terms of the broader IT management vision,&#8221; Diaz told TechCrunch.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/blissfully\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"blissfully\">Blissfully <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> believed that SaaS was going to take a bigger and bigger part of IT in terms of mindshare, spend and how you manage it, and they turned out to be right.

In addition, they are adding role-based access control to allow different people access to various IT management services, which is increasingly essential during the pandemic as people are being forced to troubleshoot and manage various IT issues from home. Finally, the startup is opening up its APIs so that IT can tap into that and build customized functionality or workflows on top of the Blissfully platform.<\/p>\n<p>Diaz believes that the company has reached a point of maturity when it comes to SaaS management, and they saw a need in the midmarket to provide these additional IT services that larger organizations tend to get from a company like ServiceNow.<\/p>\n<p>The new services will be available starting today from Blissfully.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"GAueQcAKHl\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/10\/01\/why-blissfully-decided-to-go-all-in-on-serverless\/\">Why Blissfully decided to go all in on serverless<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Why Blissfully decided to go all in on serverless&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/10\/01\/why-blissfully-decided-to-go-all-in-on-serverless\/embed\/#?secret=GAueQcAKHl\" data-secret=\"GAueQcAKHl\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When Blissfully launched in 2016, it was focused on helping companies understand their SaaS usage inside their organizations, but over time the company has seen that there is a wider need, especially in midmarket companies, and today it announced it was expanding into broader IT management.
