But on this record \u2014 while the government has established that China\u2019s activities raise significant national- security concerns \u2014 it has put in scant little evidence that its effective ban of WeChat for all U.S. users addresses those concerns. And, as the plaintiffs point out, there are obvious alternatives to a complete ban, such as barring WeChat from government devices, as Australia has done, or taking other steps to address data security.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Given the likelihood of a lawsuit proceeding and the immediate damage a ban would have if implemented, the judge initiated a nationwide injunction against implementation of the Commerce Department\u2019s order to ban the app.<\/p>\n<p>Commerce will have a chance to respond to this development, and whether it chooses to edit its order, pursue other avenues through the courts, or just rescind the order entirely, we will see in the coming days.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A few days ago, the U.S. Commerce Department published a series of rules that aimed to block the downloading of TikTok and WeChat by American users, following an executive order signed by President Trump back in August.

Users collected these cricket-themed stickers for sending money to others, or making transactions such as topping up credit on their phone or paying their broadband or electricity bill.<\/p>\n<p>In a statement on Sunday evening, a Google spokesperson said, \u201coffering cashbacks and vouchers alone do not constitute a violation of our Google Play gambling policies\u201d and that Play Store \u201cpolicies are applied and enforced on all developers consistently.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But it\u2019s arguably anything but consistent.<\/p>\n<p>On September 18, Google told Paytm that it had pulled its app for not complying with Play Store\u2019s \u201cgambling policy\u201d as it offered games with \u201cloyalty points.\u201d Paytm said that Google had not expressed any concerns over Paytm\u2019s new marketing campaign prior to its notice on Friday, in which it revealed that Paytm app had been temporarily removed from the Play Store.<\/p>\n<p>But Google itself is running a similar campaign linked to cricket in India, Paytm argues. (Why cricket? Cricket is immensely popular in India and one of the biggest cricket tournaments globally, Indian Premier League, kicked off its latest season on Saturday.)<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2049284\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2049284\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2049284 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"286\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg 3284w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=150,42 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=300,84 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=768,214 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=680,190 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=1536,428 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=2048,571 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=50,14 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2049284\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cricket-themed cashback offered by Paytm (left) and Google Pay (right) in India<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Google Play Store in India has long prohibited apps that promote gambling such as betting on sporting events, and Google has raised concerns about Paytm&#8217;s marquee app promoting Paytm First Games, a fantasy sports app run by Paytm, in the past.<\/p>\n<p>Paytm executives argued that <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/phonepe\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"phonepe\">PhonePe, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> a Walmart-owned payments app in India, also promoted Dream11, the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/indian-fantasy-sports-app-dream11s-parent-firm-raises-225m-at-over-2-5b-valuation\/\">most popular fantasy sports app in the country<\/a>, and got away without any action.<\/p>\n<p>Google also permits fantasy sports app operators &#8212; including Paytm &#8212; to advertise on Search in India.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-theme=\"light\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Where is Google hypocritical?

The removal of Paytm app was only on the grounds of Paytm offering cricket-themed cashback, he claimed. \u201cGoogle is not allowing us to acquire new customers right now. That\u2019s all what this is,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s payments app, Google Pay, competes with Paytm in India. In fact, Google Pay is the largest payments app for peer-to-peer transaction between users in India and holds the largest market share in UPI.<\/p>\n<p>Without identifying any names, Sharma, the poster child of Indian startup ecosystem, claimed that many founders in India have just accepted that it is Google that has the final say on any matter in India &#8212; and not the country\u2019s regulatory agencies.<\/p>\n<p>For Google, which reaches more users than any other company in India and whose Android operating system commands 99% of the local smartphone market, this kind of accusation is exactly what it needs to avoid in the country. The Silicon Valley search and advertising giant has launched a charm offensive in India, including a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/13\/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india\/\">recently commitment to invest $10 billion<\/a> &#8212;\u00a0more than any other American or Chinese technology firm.<\/p>\n<p>The timing for Google&#8217;s parent company, Alphabet, couldn&#8217;t be worse. Google is currently the <a href=\"https:\/\/in.reuters.com\/article\/us-india-google-antitrust-exclusive\/exclusive-google-faces-antitrust-case-in-india-over-payments-app-sources-idUKKBN2331G3\">subject of an antitrust complaint<\/a> in India over an allegation that it has abused its market position to unfairly promote its mobile payments app in the country; and in the U.S., Congress has intimidated that it may pursue antitrust regulatory action against Alphabet and Apple over app store concerns.<\/p>\n<p>In India, Google&#8217;s moves could have a devastating impact on businesses and everyday consumers.<\/p>\n<p>Paytm is not just a payments app. It is also a fully licensed digital bank. And just an eight-hour of absence from the Play Store created a panic among a portion of its users. A source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that Paytm saw several people withdraw their fixed deposit in Paytm Payments Bank on Friday.<\/p>\n<p>Anecdotally, TechCrunch heard of instances where vendors who previously preferred Paytm for accepting money digitally asked their customers to use a different payments method as they had heard that Paytm was \u201cbanned\u201d in India.<\/p>\n<p>Sharma said Google&#8217;s monopoly on Indian app ecosystem is of a magnitude unparalleled elsewhere in the world.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf paying someone and getting a cashback is gambling, then the same rule should be applied to everyone,\u201d said Sharma. \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful that we are standing here at the cusp of an internet revolution in India and we are being sanctioned by companies that are not governed by the law of this country.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If this sentiment gained traction in India it could create challenges for Google&#8217;s future in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. is forcing a Chinese company to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/19\/tiktok-deal-terms\/\">sell stakes to local firms to continue operations in the country<\/a>. In a recent episode of Dithering podcast, Ben Thompson cautioned that Trump administration\u2019s move &#8212; which some have argued is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/08\/18\/opinion\/tiktok-wechat-ban-trump.html\">a long due tit for tat against Chinese companies<\/a> (as China has long prevented U.S. firms from meaningfully operating in the world&#8217;s largest \u00a0internet market) &#8212;\u00a0might encourage\u00a0other open markets to do to American firms what it is doing to TikTok.<\/p>\n<p>Several U.S. tech executives share these concerns.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The problem with this TikTok deal is that the US is the largest player in tech globally.

capitalism and the American theft of Chinese innovation"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">It used to be \u201ceasy\u201d to tell the American and Chinese economies apart. One was innovative, one made clones. One was a free market while the other demanded payments to a political party and its leadership, a corrupt wealth generating scam that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/business\/global\/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html\">by some estimates<\/a> has netted top leaders billions of dollars. One kept the talent borders porous acting as a magnet for the world\u2019s top brains while the other interviewed you in a backroom at the airport before imprisoning you on sedition charges (okay, that might have been both).<\/p>\n<p>The comparison was always facile yes, but it was easy and at least directionally accurate if failing on the specifics.<\/p>\n<p>Now though, the country that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2019\/04\/lithium-ion-batteries-amazon-are-exploding\/587005\/\">exported exploding batteries<\/a> is pioneering quantum computing, while the country that pioneered the internet <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/03\/made-in-america-is-on-government-life-support-and-the-prognosis-isnt-good\/\">now builds planes that fall out of the sky<\/a> (and good news, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/boeing-flags-additional-787-production-problem-11599577936\">we\u2019ve identified even more planes<\/a> that might fall out of the sky at an airport near you!)<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tiktok\">TikTok\u2019s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> success is many things, but it is quite frankly just an embarrassment for the United States. There are thousands of entrepreneurs and hundreds of venture capitalists swarming Silicon Valley and the other American innovation hubs looking for the next great social app or building it themselves. But the power law of user growth and investor returns happens to reside in Haidian, Beijing. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/bytedance\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"bytedance\">ByteDance <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> through its local apps in China and overseas apps like TikTok <i>is<\/i> the consumer investor return of the past decade (there\u2019s a reason why all the IPOs this seasons are enterprise SaaS).<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a win that you can\u2019t chalk up just to industrial policy. Unlike in semiconductors or other capital-intensive industries where Beijing can offer billions in incentives to spur development, ByteDance builds apps. It distributes them on app stores across the world. It has exactly the same tools available to it that every entrepreneur with an Apple Developer account has access to. There is no <a href=\"https:\/\/www.csis.org\/analysis\/made-china-2025\">Made in China 2025<\/a> plan to build and popularize a consumer app like TikTok (you literally can\u2019t plan for consumer success like that). Instead, it\u2019s a well-executed product that\u2019s addictive to hundreds of millions of people.<\/p>\n<p>So much as China protected its industry from overseas competitors like Google and Amazon through market-entry barriers, America is now protecting its entrenched incumbents from overseas competitors like TikTok. We\u2019re demanding joint ventures and local cloud data sovereignty just as the Communist Party has demanded for years.<\/p>\n<p>Hell, we\u2019re apparently demanding a $5 billion tax payment from ByteDance, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-09-20\/trump-wants-5-billion-from-tiktok-deal-for-new-history-project\">which the president says will fund patriotic education for youth<\/a>. The president says a lot of things of course, but at least the $5 billion price point has been confirmed by Oracle in its press release over night (what the tax revenue will <i>actually<\/i> be used for is anyone\u2019s guess). If you followed the recent Hong Kong protests for a long time, you will remember that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-hongkong-patriotism\/hong-kong-frets-over-china-model-patriotic-education-idUSBRE86A09L20120711\">patriotic youth education<\/a> was some of the original tinder for those demonstrations back in 2012. What comes around, goes around, I guess.<\/p>\n<p>Development economists like to talk about \u201ccatch-up\u201d strategies, tactics that countries can take to avoid the middle income trap and cut the gap between the West and the rest. But what we need now are developed economists to explain America\u2019s \u201cfall behind\u201d strategy. Because we are falling behind, in pretty much everything.<\/p>\n<p>As the TikTok process and the earlier Huawei imbroglio show, America is no longer on the leading edge of technology in many key strategic markets. Mainland Chinese companies are globally winning in areas as diverse as 5G and social networks, and without direct government intervention to kill that innovation, American and European tech purveyors would have lost those markets entirely (and even <i>with<\/i> those interventions, they may still lose them). In Taiwan, TSMC has come from behind Intel to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/051b2c80-d53b-410e-8e80-f433d25a82dd\">take a year or two lead<\/a> in the fabrication of the most advanced semiconductors.<\/p>\n<p>I mean, we can\u2019t even pilfer Chinese history and mythology and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/21428088\/mulan-review-disney-live-action-remake\">turn it into a decent god damn film<\/a> these days.<\/p>\n<p>And the fall-behind strategy continues. Immigration restrictions from an administration hell-bent on destroying the single greatest source of American innovation, coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic, have fused into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/international-student-enrollment-trump-covid19-5caad69c-f6d4-4b79-bfb4-7b6ed038bc5b.html\">the largest single drop in international student migration in American history<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Why does that matter? In the U.S. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.insidehighered.com\/quicktakes\/2017\/10\/11\/foreign-students-and-graduate-stem-enrollment\">according to relatively recent data<\/a>, 81% of electrical engineering grad students are international, 79% in computer science are, and in most engineering and technical fields, the number hovers above a majority.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s great to believe the fantasy that if only these international grad students would stay home, then \u201creal\u201d Americans would somehow take these slots. But what\u2019s true of the strawberry pickers and food service workers is also true for EE grad students: proverbial \u201cAmericans\u201d don\u2019t want these jobs. They are hard jobs, thankless jobs, and require a ridiculous tenacity that American workers and students by and large don\u2019t have. These industries have huge contingents of foreign workers precisely because no one domestic wants to take these roles.<\/p>\n<p>So goes the talent, so goes the innovation. Without this wellspring of brainpower lodging itself in America\u2019s top innovation hubs, where exactly do we think it will go? That former aspiring Stanford or MIT computer scientist with ideas in his or her brain isn\u2019t just going to sit by the window gazing at the horizon waiting for the moment when they can enter the gilded halls of the U.S. of A. It\u2019s the internet era, and they are just going to get started on their dreams wherever they are, using whatever tools and resources they have available to them.<\/p>\n<p>All you have to do is look at the recent YC batches and realize that the future cohorts of great startups are going to increasingly come from outside the continental 48. Dozens of smart, brilliant entrepreneurs aren\u2019t even trying to migrate, instead rightfully seeing their home markets as more open to innovation and technological progress than the vaunted superpower. The frontier is closed here, and it has moved elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>So what are we left with here in the U.S. and increasingly Europe? A narrow-minded policy of blocking external tech innovation to ensure that our sclerotic and entrenched incumbents don\u2019t have to compete with the best in the world. If that isn\u2019t a recipe for economic disaster, I don\u2019t know what is.<\/p>\n<p>But hey: at least the youth will be patriotic.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It used to be \u201ceasy\u201d to tell the American and Chinese economies apart.

subscription monetization to more apps in 2016 \u2014 and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2016\/6\/8\/11880730\/apple-app-store-subscription-update-phil-schiller-interview\">enticed developers with an 85\/15 split<\/a> on revenue from customers that remain subscribed for more than a year \u2014 subscription monetization and retention has felt like the Holy Grail for app developers. So much so that <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/googleplay\/android-developer\/answer\/112622?hl=en\">Google quickly followed suit<\/a>\u00a0in what appeared to be an example of healthy competition for developers in the mobile OS duopoly.<\/p>\n<p>But how does that split actually work out for most apps? Turns out, the 85\/15 split \u2014 which Apple is keen to mention anytime developers complain about the App Store rev share \u2014 doesn\u2019t have a meaningful impact for most developers. Because churn.<\/p>\n<p>No matter how great an app is, subscribers are going to churn. Sometimes it\u2019s because of a credit card expiring or some other billing issue. And sometimes it\u2019s more of a pause, and the user comes back after a few months. But the majority of churn comes from subscribers who, for whatever reason, decide that the app just isn\u2019t worth paying for anymore. If a subscriber churns before the one-year mark, the developer never sees that 85% split. And even if the user resubscribes, Apple and Google reset the clock if a subscription has lapsed for more than 60 days. Rather convenient\u2026 for Apple and Google.<\/p>\n<p>Top mobile apps like Netflix and Spotify report churn rates in the low single digits, but they are the outliers. According to our data, the median churn rate for subscription apps is around\u00a013% for monthly subscriptions\u00a0and around 50% for annual. Monthly subscription churn is generally a bit higher in the first few months, then it tapers off. But an average churn of 13% leaves just 20% of subscribers crossing that magical 85\/15 threshold.<\/p>\n<p>In practice, what this means is that, for all the hype around the 85\/15 split, very few developers are going to see a meaningful increase in revenue:<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2048964\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img

rumors beg the question: Did Trump solve anything?"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Over the past 24 hours, rumors picked up by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-09-16\/oracle-s-tiktok-bid-leaves-u-s-security-concerns-unaddressed?sref=j5SuHr0s\">Bloomberg<\/a>, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/trump-administration-pushes-for-u-s-control-of-tiktok-11600295711?mod=hp_lead_pos3\">Wall Street Journal<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/09\/17\/trump-to-rule-on-tiktok-deal-in-24-36-hours-oracle-to-take-20percent-stake.html\">CNBC<\/a> have put some boundaries on what a possible deal between Oracle and TikTok\u2019s parent company ByteDance will look like.<\/p>\n<p>In its current incarnation floating around the DC press corps, it appears that <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tiktok\">TikTok\u2019s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> data on American users will be stored in Oracle\u2019s cloud, with <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/oracle\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"oracle\">Oracle <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> acting as a \u201ctrusted technology partner.\u201d Oracle will have some sort of real-time source code verification duty, in which it will audit TikTok\u2019s codebase to ensure that there aren\u2019t \u201cbackdoors\u201d that allow China to siphon data into its national security apparatus. ByteDance will create a new organization for its U.S. operations, which will have a board of directors approved by the U.S. government and will have a license agreement to access TikTok\u2019s algorithms. One member of that board (at least) will come from the American national security community.<\/p>\n<p>There remains a pretty yawning gap in these rumors over what the ownership of this new entity looks like, and precisely who is going to own what. Oracle is presumed to take a fairly large stake, with CNBC reporting this morning that it will get a 20% stake. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/walmart\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"walmart\">Walmart <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> apparently has broken away from its deal partner Microsoft, and is still pursuing some sort of deal engagement with the company, now with Oracle as its champion.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>While President Trump has repeatedly said that a deal had to be reached by September 15, his executive order gave the parties until September 20 to hash out an agreement. Therefore, we expect a final deal to be approved \u2014 or denied outright \u2014 in the next two to three days.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously, all terms are still under negotiation, and for all we know, McDonalds will end up buying the company (it\u2019s been that kind of year).<\/p>\n<p>Given what we know so far though, how did the Trump administration do in furthering its goals? The administration has repeatedly said that it wants to protect American users, particularly the young users who love TikTok, from the prying eyes of China. It also wanted to ensure that any protections would last into the future and couldn\u2019t be changed retrospectively by, say, a more aggressive future policy implemented by China. And Trump has also said that the U.S. government <a href=\"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Politics\/trump-demand-payment-microsoft-tiktok-deal\/story?id=72187365\">should be paid<\/a> for allowing the company to essentially continue to exist in the U.S. at all.<\/p>\n<p>The latter point is the easiest one \u2014 U.S. government lawyers have said outright that the country <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/trump-admits-tiktok-cant-legally-pay-us-government-sale-2020-9\">can\u2019t accept a payment for allowing a deal through<\/a>, a point that Trump now appears to agree with.<\/p>\n<p>So let\u2019s head over to national security and privacy. Hosting American data on American soil helps with some jurisdictional issues of course. So-called <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/29\/gdpr-and-the-cloud-winners\/\">data sovereignty laws<\/a> have been popular in the European Union, China, India, Brazil and elsewhere as a means of ensuring that citizen data comports with the laws of those citizens\u2019 countries. If the EU wants better privacy protections than America for instance, then it actually needs to \u201cown\u201d its own data to put its policies into place.<\/p>\n<p>However, what has not been made clear is how \u201cTikTok US\u201d (or whatever the entity is called) will be able to take advantage of its parent company\u2019s algorithms without actually handing American data over for processing.<\/p>\n<p>The kinds of algorithms that run TikTok\u2019s feed \u2014 like other social media feeds or Google\u2019s search results \u2014 require real-time tuning of millions if not billions of parameters benchmarked against the quality of the user experience. For instance, users who linger on a particular video for longer than others, interact with it in specific ways, and share it are all data points that get fed into the \u201calgorithm\u201d to optimize exactly what each user sees in their own feeds.<\/p>\n<p>This is an extraordinarily hard problem, and one that the word \u201calgorithm\u201d barely begins to describe. TikTok has to ingest billions of data points <i>in real time<\/i> from its app, needs to evaluate mullions of uploaded videos <i>in real time<\/i>, and needs to curate a custom stream of videos <i>in real time<\/i> for hundreds of millions of active users. That\u2019s not an algorithm so much as a massively scaled computing system.<\/p>\n<p>In the current deal framework, it sounds like \u201cTikTok US\u201d will supposedly \u201clicense\u201d the underlying systems that power TikTok Global\u2019s feeds. Yet, there has so far been zero clarity on how those algorithmic systems can tune their parameters without peering into U.S. data, or even how you can bifurcate such a system into a global half and a U.S.-only half.<\/p>\n<p>One answer might be that the U.S.will just have an entirely independent algorithmic system that is tuned to the tastes of U.S. users and doesn\u2019t take input from other global sources. That might work, although it\u2019s an open question whether the smaller scale of TikTok US\u2019 data will allow it to create as compelling a feed as today.<\/p>\n<p>The larger issue is the pace of change in these systems. Updates to these algorithmic systems happen around the clock as engineers, product managers, data scientists and others determine ever more optimal and novel ways to improve the user experience. TikTok\u2019s engineering team is expected to stay in China, meaning that any entity licensing those systems would have to absorb that constant avalanche of new code changes and integrate it into the U.S. codebase. Worse, those changes would have to be continuously evaluated by Oracle for backdoors \u2014 an incredibly hard engineering problem that remains by and large unsolved even if certain services offer a modicum of protection here.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, building this infrastructure is not going to be easy. We haven\u2019t heard much on how long TikTok would have to transition its systems, but it is hard to imagine that the company could rebuild its infrastructure on Oracle, add in real-time source code verification, completely separate its core machine learning algorithms into independent systems, and do all that while continuing to adapt its product to changing consumer whims in anything less than three years. One doesn\u2019t just rebuild the code from scratch of a system used by hundreds of millions of people.<\/p>\n<p>In all honesty, the rapid iterations required of a social media service will wither and die in the deal framework offered here. Which means that TikTok\u2019s U.S. engineering efforts look all but doomed if this deal is approved.<\/p>\n<p>Then there is this deal term of potentially adding an all U.S. government-approved board, with at least one director coming with a national security background. That experience isn\u2019t unheard of in tech companies these days: <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/09\/former-nsa-chief-general-keith-alexander-is-now-on-amazons-board\/\">Amazon just last week added former National Security Agency director Keith Alexander to its board<\/a>, presumably due to the company\u2019s expanding cloud services sales to the government.<\/p>\n<p>Given that so many of the concerns expressed by the administration were around citizen privacy though, how exactly does this board structure protect privacy whatsoever? The company will essentially replace presumed Chinese surveillance with presumed American surveillance, and that\u2019s a Pyrrhic victory in the end. We\u2019ve heard next to nothing in these rumors about how the company can better protect user data in a more transparent fashion.<\/p>\n<p>So the net-net right now is that the U.S. government isn\u2019t going to get paid its tithe\/bribe, the company\u2019s engineering velocity is going to crater from bureaucracy, and its user data won\u2019t have any more protections than what pretty much already exists with other social networks.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe in the end, killing TikTok was the goal all along. Certainly some analysts in the DC national security community would like to see that happen. But at least from the seat over here, what a colossal failure of imagination and opportunity.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Over the past 24 hours, rumors picked up by Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal and CNBC have put some boundaries on what a possible deal between Oracle and TikTok\u2019s parent company ByteDance will look like.

She recently left Atomico to pursue her early and seed-stage passion with Cherry Ventures. Bendz is a prolific angel investor, with a total of more than 44 deals in the last nine years. Her angel investments include AidenAI, Tictail, Joints Academy, Omnius, LifeX, Eastnine, Manual, Headvig, Simple Feast and Sana Labs. She is known for being a champion of the femtech space, and her angel investments in that space include Clue, Grace Health, Daye, O School and Boost Thyroid.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/carolina-brochado\">Carolina Brochado<\/a>, the former Atomico partner and most recently a partner at SoftBank Vision Fund\u2019s London office, recently joined EQT Ventures to help launch EQT\u2019s Growth fund, which is positioned between ventures and private equity. Brochado led investments in a number of promising companies at Atomico,\u00a0 including logistics company OnTruck, health tech company Hinge Health and restaurant supply chain app Rekki.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>After establishing that these two knew each other while at Atomico, I asked Bendz why she headed back into the seed-stage arena.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a trained marketeer and storyteller by heart\u2026 What makes me excited is new markets opportunities, people, culture, teams. So with that, in combination with my angel investing, I think I&#8217;m better suited to be in the earlier stages of investing. When I was investing before joining Atomico, I said to myself, I want to learn from the best, I want to see how it&#8217;s done, how you structure the process and how you think about the bigger investments.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Brochado says the European &#8220;cat is out of the bag,&#8221; as it were:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>When I first moved to Europe in 2012 and first joined Atomico, after having been at a very small startup, there was still a massive gap in funding and Europe versus the U.S. I think you know the European secret is no longer a secret, and you have incredible funds being started at that early-stage seed and Series A, and because I was here in 2012, I&#8217;ve seen the amazing pipeline of growth companies that are coming up the curve, how the momentum of those companies is accelerating and how the market cap of those businesses are growing. And so I just became super excited about helping those businesses scale\u2026 I just now felt like bridging that gap in between was really exciting.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>One of the perennial topics that come up time and time again is whether or not founders should go with VC partners who have previously been operators, versus those with a finance background.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLooking back, my years at Spotify, we had great investors, but there were not many of them that had the experience of scaling a big company,&#8221; Bendz said. &#8220;So, I&#8217;m happy to give [a startup] more than just the check in a way that I would have wished I had a sounding board when I was 25 and tackling that challenge at Spotify.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Brochado concurred: \u201cHaving operators in the room is just is an incredible gift I think to a fund and at certain levels, having people that understand you know different forms of financing and different structures can also be incredibly helpful to founders who may not necessarily have that background. So I think that the funds that do it best have that diversity.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Bendz is passionate about investing in female founders and femtech: \u201cIt&#8217;s such a massive business opportunity that is completely untapped. We&#8217;ve seen it many times when you have a female investment partner [that] the pipeline opens up and you get more deal flow from female founders&#8230;. So I think we have a lot of work to do. I think it&#8217;s definitely improved a lot in the last couple of years but not enough\u2026 That is one of the drivers for why I put my money where my mouth is and invest in lifting the founders, but also because there are incredibly interesting business opportunities\u2026 There are so many opportunities and products or services that we will see being developed. When we have a more equal society, and more women, both building their own companies, coding and also investing\u2026 I can&#8217;t wait to see what that world will look like.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Brochado\u2019s view is that \u201ceven beyond founders\u2026 the best managers today are putting a lot of focus on this and I think what&#8217;s exciting is, I think we&#8217;re past the point where you have to explain to people why diversity matters.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Is there a post-Series A chasm?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Bendz thinks: \u201cWe have more big funds in Europe [now]. We have a really solid ground here in Europe of A, B and C investors.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Brochado said: \u201cIt&#8217;s definitely getting better. You don&#8217;t hear as many founders say that to do my Series B or my Series C I have to move to the Valley as you used to. But there&#8217;s a lot of room still for growth investors in Europe. I think Series B is the hardest round actually because, at seed or Series A, you can raise on very early traction or the quality of the management team. At Series B the price goes up but the risk doesn&#8217;t necessarily go down as much. And so I think that&#8217;s where you really need investors who are sector or thematic focused, who can come with conviction and also some knowledge around the company to really propel that company forward.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Did they both see European entrepreneurs still making silly mistakes, or has the ecosystem mastered?<\/p>\n<p>Brochado thinks 10 years ago it was hard for European founders as a lot of the talent to scale companies was still in the U.S. \u201cWhat you&#8217;ve seen is a lot of big companies grow up in Europe, a lot of people come back from the U.S., and so I think that pool of talent now is larger, which is very helpful. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s yet at the scale of where the U.S. is. But it gives us, you know as investors, a great window of opportunity to help get some of that talent for our portfolio companies.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>The impact of COVID-19<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Bendz thinks we will \u201csee a much slower spring, but\u2026 I think it has been overall a good exercise for some companies, and I have not seen a slower deal flow. I\u2019ve actually done more angel deals this spring than I normally do\u2026 Some businesses have definitely accelerated their whole business concept because of COVID. Investments are being made even though we haven&#8217;t met the founders. We\u2019re able to do everything remotely so I think the system is kind of adjusting.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Brochado\u2019s view is that at the growth stage \u201cthere&#8217;s been a flight to quality. So actually, the really great companies or the companies that are seeing great tailwinds or companies that will still be category-leading once [have] seen a lot of interest. It&#8217;s been a very busy summer, which usually it isn\u2019t, particularly at the growth stage\u2026 I think a lot of money is still in the system, and has flown into technology. And so if you look at how tech in the public markets has performed it&#8217;s performed extremely well. And that includes European public companies and within tech.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Watch the full panel below.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f5c0f26ae62e42c37634fd8\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As part of Disrupt 2020 we wanted to look at the contrasting positions of both early and later-stage investing in Europe.

href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/hulu\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"hulu\">Hulu <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> was one of the first major streaming services to introduce a &#8220;co-viewing&#8221; feature that allows friends and family to watch Hulu content together from different locations. The feature, Hulu Watch Party, was initially only available for subscribers on the the ad-free tier of Hulu&#8217;s streaming service. Now, the company is making Watch Party available to ad-supported subscribers as well, but in a more limited capacity.<\/p>\n<p>When <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/28\/hulu-launches-a-new-watch-party-feature-for-virtual-viewing-parties-and-chat\/\">Hulu Watch Party launched in May<\/a>, it worked across thousands of movies and TV shows in Hulu&#8217;s on-demand streaming library. As Hulu explained at the time, if a show is available for co-viewing, it will indicate this with a &#8220;Watch Party&#8221; icon on the title&#8217;s Details page. Users can then provide the co-viewing link to those with whom they want to watch together. Currently, a Watch Party session supports up to eight people.<\/p>\n<p>What makes Hulu&#8217;s implementation different from those seen on rival services is that viewers can control their own Watch Party experience. If someone wants to grab a snack or needs a bathroom break, for example, they can pause playback. But doing so doesn&#8217;t impact the group&#8217;s shared stream. Then, when they return, the viewer can either watch what they missed or tap a &#8220;Catch Up&#8221; button to get back in sync with the group.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Hulu says since the product debuted, viewers have used Watch Party to host movie nights and watch new series premieres. &#8220;Palm Springs,&#8221; &#8220;Parasite&#8221; and &#8220;Love, Victor&#8221; were among the top titles that were co-viewed to date.<\/p>\n<p>Now, Hulu wants to bring the feature to ad-supported viewers.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2048091\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2048091\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2048091\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Pen15-Hulu-Watch-Party.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2048091\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Hulu<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The company is testing co-watching on &#8220;Pen15,&#8221; whose season 2 premieres on Friday, September 18.<\/p>\n<p>Over the next 10 days, Hulu subscribers on both the ad-supported and ad-free plans will be able to join Watch Parties for this particular program.<\/p>\n<p>Hulu is also trying out a branded experience within Watch Party for this particular test.<\/p>\n<p>In a nod to the show, the Watch Party interface will be designed to resemble a classic instant messenger chat room, and will include screen names taken from the series. This design will only display when Watch Party is used to stream &#8220;Pen15,&#8221; not other shows. It&#8217;s an interesting example of how Watch Party could help build out more of a fan community around a show by theming the chat interface in a unique way for viewers.<\/p>\n<p>Users today have to be 18 and older to use Watch Party, Hulu says. Support for co-viewing of &#8220;Pen15&#8221; across Hulu&#8217;s tiers is live as of Wednesday and will continue for 10 days from that date.<\/p>\n<p>The company is now one of several to either officially support co-viewing or at least endorse it.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/amazon\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"amazon\">Amazon&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Twitch <a href=\"https:\/\/variety.com\/2020\/digital\/news\/twitch-watch-parties-amazon-prime-video-titles-1234576194\/\">launched<\/a> Watch Parties for Amazon Prime Video following <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/29\/amazon-prime-video-introduces-watch-party-a-social-coviewing-experience-included-with-prime\/\">a built-in feature on Prime Video itself<\/a>. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/28\/plex-launches-a-co-watching-experience-for-its-on-demand-library-and-users-personal-media\/\">Plex<\/a> added Watch Together in May, and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/14\/scener-now-lets-you-co-watch-hbo-or-netflix-in-a-virtual-theater-with-up-to-20-people\/\">HBO teamed up<\/a> with Scener for co-viewing experiences.

rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Imagine Impact<\/a>, a content accelerator that <a href=\"https:\/\/imagine-entertainment.com\/ron-howard-and-brian-grazer-debut-imagine-impact\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">launched two years<\/a> ago under production powerhouse Imagine Entertainment to impart a &#8220;Y Combinator&#8221; approach to sourcing new work and connecting it with production opportunities, has raised a Series A round of funding from Benchmark, the VC firm that has backed Uber, Twitter, Dropbox, Snapchat and many more &#8212; funding that it plans to use to continue building out its accelerator model as well as launching new technology ventures, it said.<\/p>\n<p>With the investment, Imagine Impact is effectively spinning out of <a

Entertainment, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and rebranding as a standalone company called <a href=\"https:\/\/impactcreativesystems.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Impact Creative Systems<\/a>.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Brian Grazer and Ron Howard, the high-profile duo that in 1985 started the <a href=\"https:\/\/imagine-entertainment.com\/film\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">film<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/imagine-entertainment.com\/television\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TV<\/a> production company that has been behind a string of hits, stay on as founders, but Impact (as the firm calls itself) will be run day to day by CEO Tyler Mitchell. (And all three will be talking with us on the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/disrupt-sf-2020\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Disrupt stage today<\/a> about this and more.)<\/p>\n<p>Mitchell says that the amount of the investment, the first outside money that Impact has taken, is not being disclosed but that it&#8217;s in line with a typical <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/benchmark\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"benchmark\">Benchmark <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Series A. That would put it between $10 million and $20 million. The investment is being led by Bill Gurley, who will join the board with the deal.<\/p>\n<p>The funding will be used to help the firm spearhead new ventures that continue building out the idea of taking a new approach to networking and finding career opportunities throughout the entertainment industry, breaking down some of the barriers of how business has always been done &#8212; through networks of who you know, lots of lunches and other hobnobbing. The idea is for the projects coming out of Impact to be underpinned not just with a tech ethos, but with actual technology.<\/p>\n<p>First up is the launch later this year of The Creative Network, which Imagine describes as &#8220;an online marketplace and professional networking platform designed specifically for entertainment industry professionals to help bring efficiency and access to Hollywood.&#8221; It&#8217;s a little like LinkedIn meets Behance.<\/p>\n<p>Up to now, Impact has been focusing its energies on building out its accelerators and securing deals for the writers in its cohorts, with the whole set-up inspired by the famous Silicon Valley accelerator.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f63a2c9ddb6614e940d36f7\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n<p>The YC playbook is used in two ways. The first is in the model it&#8217;s using, where it opens applications to anyone interested to applying, and then provides those selected with mentorship, time and a little financing to do their creative work. The second comes in the form of the mentors having a lot of connections in the industry and using those to help the writers connect with others to produce their work.<\/p>\n<p>The accelerator model has seen an accelerating amount of interest. Impact now has built a second accelerator outside of LA, in Australia, and started a podcast featuring interviews with famous actors, directors and others (pointing to other kinds of content that it might spin out as business projects). And it has inked a deal with Netflix Films to help source and develop content globally.<\/p>\n<p>And perhaps most interestingly for laying groundwork for The Creative Network, it has built up a network of 30,000 writers across 80 countries; it has helped develop 72 projects, 25 of which are now with major studios.<\/p>\n<p>Those efforts have also had some tech built around them. Mitchell said that a beta of sorts for The Creative Network was built originally to use for the accelerator. &#8220;We built it because we were just three people running the accelerator and didn&#8217;t have the human resources available to send out or read potentially thousands of scripts&#8221; &#8212; specifically 3,000 script submissions in 72 hours &#8212; &#8220;so we built a mobile app.&#8221; Features include the ability to push submissions, make watermarks and track emails in the bigger database, he said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We talk about ourselves as a dating app,&#8221; joked Mitchell. &#8220;You have to get four people to fall in love with one story or writer or piece of material&#8221; to advance, he said, &#8220;the\u00a0producer, director, star and financier. That involves a lot of phone calls and relationships and phone tag. It can be a very long process to triangulate and build the right teams.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>While efforts so far have been focused on building ways of connecting writers with producers, the bigger picture is to build a network that can bring in the rest of the ecosystem, including directors, actors and the extensive technical and admin talent needed to get a project off the ground and on to a screen. All of these connections up to now have been firmly stuck in the analogue world, making them slow, limited in terms of inclusiveness, and obviously very ripe for technological disruption.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It takes 500-1,000 people in total to bring a project to life,&#8221; Mitchell said. And the bigger opportunity for connecting networks is massive. Mitchell estimates that just in the U.S., the production business employs 2.6 million people and accounts for some $177 billion in wages each year, and it&#8217;s growing.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe old way of sourcing talent in the entertainment industry is based on who you know, which presents high barriers-to-entry for the fresh voices we need to hear from,\u201d said Gurley, in a statement. \u201cImpact is knocking down these barriers through a marketplace model that reduces information asymmetry and levels the playing field. Ultimately this leads to more opportunities and better outcomes for everyone involved.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, Hollywood has been between a rock and a hard place when it comes to changing up its ways.<\/p>\n<p>On one side, the industry regularly faces criticism for lacking diversity in its ranks and failing to identify with the masses. Complaints include too few women in decision-making roles and the difficulty of finding work if you don&#8217;t fit into particular age and appearance types; accusations of racism (OscarsSoWhite being a recurring theme each awards season); and more.<\/p>\n<p>On the other, the media industry &#8212; including how consumers watch video &#8212; is rapidly evolving. For better or worse, the TV was once the absolute epicenter of how a family came together and saw what was happening in the world outside. Those Happy Days are gone now, so to speak. People watch YouTube and TikTok, Snapchat and Netflix, and while some of that definitely is still tapping into the older Hollywood ecosystem &#8212; Netflix, of course, repurposes a lot of traditional TV and film content, and commissions its own &#8212; it also speaks to just how rapidly the mediums and their delivery are changing.<\/p>\n<p>While the first efforts of Impact are addressing the first group of these issues, one follow-up question &#8212; the sequel, you might say &#8212; might be how and if Impact chooses to use its networks, tech and strategy to think about the second of these.<\/p>\n<p>Before coming to the entertainment industry (he was a writer and producer for years before this), Mitchell said he had a background in finance and has &#8220;always been entrepreneurial.&#8221; The tech scene in LA has definitely been growing over the years &#8212; it&#8217;s home to Snap and others &#8212; meaning it&#8217;s ripe for tapping for hiring more people for the startup.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re talking with data scientists to build better algorithms for the Network and yes we&#8217;re hiring engineers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve attracted some incredible talent and the majority of the investment is going to scaling our team.&#8221; Impact now has 11 full-time<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0technical staff, he said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe could not be more thrilled to be working with Benchmark. They have an unrivaled track record in building marketplaces and companies that have changed the world,\u201d said Grazer, in a statement. \u201cFrom the moment we met Bill, it was clear that he understood and believed in our vision.

The goal is to create a scalable, eventually globe-spanning service that can provide service where previously unavailable, or to customers who had to rely on shaky or slow connections in the past.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"8SFR9kRg7d\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/03\/spacex-confirms-starlink-internet-private-beta-underway-showing-low-latency-and-speeds-over-100mbps\/\">SpaceX confirms Starlink internet private beta underway, showing low latency and speeds over 100Mbps<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;SpaceX confirms Starlink internet private beta underway, showing low latency and speeds over 100Mbps&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/03\/spacex-confirms-starlink-internet-private-beta-underway-showing-low-latency-and-speeds-over-100mbps\/embed\/#?secret=8SFR9kRg7d\" data-secret=\"8SFR9kRg7d\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The launch today includes use of a Falcon 9 first-stage booster that has flown twice previously, including first during SpaceX&#8217;s landmark Demo-2 Crew Dragon mission, the first ever for the company to carry human astronauts.

They can also set up personalized saved replies here, in order to respond to common customer inquiries.<\/p>\n<p>The app offers tools for creating feed posts for Facebook and Instagram, scheduling posts and provides insights on what&#8217;s working. Here, businesses can view their posts&#8217; reach, engagement and performance across both Facebook and Instagram. They can also choose to create an ad to help boost that engagement and grow their audience, if needed.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook says it&#8217;s initially building Facebook Business Suite with the needs of small businesses first, as so many have been forced by the pandemic to find new ways to reach customers and sell online. However, the long-term plan is to build out a set of tools that can be used by all businesses, including larger ones. The company aims to address that market sometime next year. Business Suite will also expand to include WhatsApp in the future.<\/p>\n<p>Related to the news, Facebook published two surveys offering insights on small business trends. One, the monthly <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2020\/09\/global-state-of-small-business-report-3\/\">Global State of Small Business Report<\/a>, produced in partnership with the World Bank and OECD, found that businesses that make more than 25% of sales online are more likely to be reporting higher sales this year, and are less likely to have laid off employees.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Deloitte-Digital-Tools-in-Crisis-and-Recovery-Report.pdf\">A second study<\/a> details the impact of COVID-19 on consumer purchasing patterns and use of digital tools. Nearly half of respondents said they spent more money online overall since the outbreak, and 40% increased their use of social media and online messaging for product and business recommendations, Facebook says.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, these fairly upbeat reports on the state of small businesses in the midst of the pandemic don&#8217;t provide the full picture. In the U.S., for example, Yelp is reporting that <a href=\"https:\/\/markets.businessinsider.com\/news\/stocks\/yelp-business-closures-permanent-covid-report-2020-9-1029598577\">60% of the U.S. businesses that closed due to COVID-19 won&#8217;t be re-opening.<\/a> As of August, 163,735 U.S. businesses have closed since the start of the pandemic, the report said, up 23% since mid-July.<\/p>\n<p>These closures could impact Facebook as well, as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/kathleenchaykowski\/2017\/04\/10\/sheryl-sandberg-facebook-hit-5-million-advertisers-by-turning-users-into-marketers\/?utm_source=FBPAGE&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=856243173&amp;utm_campaign=sprinklrForbesMainFB#356d6f72e99d\">majority <\/a>of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2020\/06\/30\/tech\/facebook-ad-business-boycott\/index.html\">Facebook&#8217;s advertisers<\/a> are small and medium-sized businesses. But Facebook&#8217;s global nature protects it. Even if the U.S. loses more small businesses due to its mishandling of the pandemic, there<a href=\"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2017\/04\/10\/facebook-has-more-than-5-million-advertisers-with-75-from-outside-the-u-s\/\"> are far more advertisers outside the U.S<\/a>. that Facebook taps into.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook says the Business Suite will gradually roll out during the month of September. The app joins several other Facebook offers today for its business customers, including Facebook Pages Manager, Facebook Analytics and Facebook Ads Manager. However, Facebook notes that its new Business Suite isn&#8217;t currently designed to serve those who use Ads Manager.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Facebook this morning launched a new app designed to make it easier for businesses to manage in a single place their pages and profiles across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger.

Currently, there are 550 Darkstores across 283 cities.<\/p>\n<p>With FastAF, consumers can now order directly from those Darkstores for same-day delivery. FastAF currently offers 1,200 items from 170 brands. Fast AF has partnered with <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/doordash\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"doordash\">DoorDash <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> to handle deliveries and a different company for returns.

FastAF sells the products at MSRP but charges consumers fees related to delivery and fulfillment. Initially, FastAF will waive that delivery fee and is considering rolling out a free delivery option for orders over a certain amount.<\/p>\n<p>Hnetinka, you may remember, founded WunWun back in 2012 to provide on-demand delivery for stores and businesses. The company, which was a strong competitor to <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/postmates\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"postmates\">Postmates, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/05\/11\/alfred-purchases-wunwun-tech-employees-in-fire-sale\/\">ultimately shut down in 2015 and then sold its assets to Alfred<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;For WunWun, we were powering offline online,&#8221; Hnetinka told me. &#8220;We had runners that went to local stores and brought you things in as fast as 30 minutes. With Darkstore, we&#8217;re powering online offline. The next wave of that has always been a consumer facing app to enable all of the brands on these e-commerce companies to deliver products quickly. We felt there was no place to get the brands you have a high affinity towards from. These are the types of brands you weren&#8217;t able to get fast, previously.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>FastAF is currently only available in Los Angeles, but the plan is to launch in New York later this year. San Francisco is on the road map, but Hnetinka did not share an exact timeline.<\/p>\n<p>Darkstore, the company behind FastAF, has raised more than $30 million in funding. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/09\/19\/darkstore-raises-21-million-series-b-round\/\">Its most recent funding came last September<\/a> as part of a $21 million Series B round led by EQT Ventures.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Darkstore, the tech-driven fulfillment solution to enable e-commerce companies to offer same-day delivery, has just released a consumer-facing app called FastAF.

Amazon didn&#8217;t disclose the amount of the investments.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>At least one of these investments has already been announced, although without the specific detail that the funds were coming from the climate fund. For instance, Amazon, an existing investor in Rivian, was a named a participant in the electric automaker&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/10\/rivian-raises-massive-2-5-billion-as-it-pushes-to-bring-its-electric-pickup-suv-to-market\/\">$2.5 billion round in July<\/a>. Rivian said 2019 it was developing an electric delivery van for Amazon using its skateboard platform. Amazon ordered 100,000 of these vans, with deliveries starting in 2021.<\/p>\n<p>While Amazon&#8217;s interest in Rivian has been public for more than a year, the other investments have been unknown until now.<\/p>\n<p>However, there were hints earlier this month that Amazon might have an interest in \u2014 and at the very least an awareness of \u2014 Redwood Materials. The startup, which launched in 2017, recently raised $40 million from investors, including Capricorn Investment Group and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the environmental-focused fund launched by Bill Gates that includes Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos as a board member. It&#8217;s possible that Amazon participated in that $40 million raise.<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s perhaps more important than the investment amount is the relationship that has been established. Redwood Materials will also help Amazon recycle lithium-ion batteries from its electric vehicles as well as\u00a0 e-waste from other parts of Amazon\u2019s businesses and reuse their components.<\/p>\n<p>Redwood Materials, a recycling startup based in Carson City, Nevada, is aiming to create a circular supply chain.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve made maybe more progress than some people may think and we&#8217;re actually running recycling operations and have revenue from those,&#8221; Straubel told TechCrunch. &#8220;In terms of customers, we have customers\u00a0 on both sides of our company \u2014 on the incoming side there is material we recycle for companies and then on the outgoing side there are chemicals and materials that we sell back into the supply chain.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Redwood already has customers on both sides of the business, Straubel said, although Panasonic and now Amazon are the only two that have been publicly named. Redwood is recycling the scrap from Panasonic&#8217;s battery cell manufacturing operation at the so-called Gigafactory it operates with Tesla in Sparks, Nevada. The company also has customers \u2014 that have yet to be named \u2014 on the consumer electronics side, Straubel said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re recycling and processing things as diverse as cell phone batteries, laptop computers, power tools, power banks, scooters and electric bicycles,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So it&#8217;s a kind of an amazing diversity of small- to mid-range applications that today really struggle to find a good solution. The recycling rates of those materials in particular are really atrocious in the market.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Redwood Materials, the recycling startup founded by Tesla&#8217;s longtime CTO and co-founder JB Straubel, has landed Amazon as a new investor and customer.

The economy contracted sharply \u2014 and the effects of the 2020 recession will persist.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a founder, you can help. You can build companies that connect people, create employment and spark lasting change.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Building is how we reboot the American dream,&#8221; declared Marc Andreessen, venture capitalist and co-founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/a16z.com\/\">Andreessen Horowitz<\/a>. In his rallying cry &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/a16z.com\/2020\/04\/18\/its-time-to-build\/\">It&#8217;s Time to Build&#8221;<\/a> he writes: &#8220;We need to break the rapidly escalating price curves for housing, education and healthcare, to make sure that every American can realize the dream, and the only way to do that is to build.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Yet building requires capital. How <em>do<\/em> you raise funding when the economy is on its knees? I spoke with six top venture capitalists to find out:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bill Trenchard, general partner, First Round Capital<\/li>\n<li>Dan Rose, chairman, Coatue Ventures<\/li>\n<li>Brianne Kimmel, founder, Work Life<\/li>\n<li>Sarah Guo, general partner, Greylock<\/li>\n<li>Merci Grace, partner, Lightspeed<\/li>\n<li>Charles Hudson, managing partner, Precursor Ventures<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>How has investment behavior changed during the pandemic?<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Deal velocity has gone up.<\/li>\n<li>The bar for investments is rising.<\/li>\n<li>VCs are nurturing existing investments and \u201cproto-founders.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The recession did not cause activity to stall. In fact, deal velocity has gone up.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s almost like a superheated environment right now,&#8221; says Bill Trenchard, general partner at <a href=\"https:\/\/firstround.com\/\">First Round<\/a>. &#8220;The speed with which partnerships can quickly meet with a company that&#8217;s of interest is so much higher in the Zoom world. It&#8217;s changing our thinking around velocity in the market, which was already very high.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been as active as we were before,&#8221; agrees Dan Rose, chairman at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coatue.com\/\">Coatue Ventures<\/a>. &#8220;Maybe even slightly more active because I think more good companies are raising as kind of an insurance policy. When it became clear that we weren&#8217;t going to be able to meet with founders in person anymore, we snapped to Zoom.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Velocity may be rising, but investors now require more data to reach conviction.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The pricing is still the same but we see risk going up,&#8221; says Bill Trenchard. &#8220;You need to be very rigorous on your investment theses and how you&#8217;re looking at companies. We&#8217;ve been looking for more grapple hooks and more data for things that we do invest in, so that we have more conviction when we do.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been almost an immediate shift in terms of expectations from VCs,&#8221; says <a href=\"http:\/\/briannekimmel.com\/\">Brianne Kimmel<\/a>, founder of early stage venture firm <a href=\"https:\/\/www.worklife.vc\/\">Work Life<\/a>. &#8220;Companies have been forced to come in with more richness and customer development, a clear path to revenue, a lot more of a strategic approach around the core mechanics of the business and more specifically the business model.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Sarah Guo, general partner at <a href=\"https:\/\/greylock.com\/\">Greylock<\/a>, also has high expectations for founders.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For founders and VCs alike, 2020 has changed the game for good.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":133574325,"featured_media":1930999,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","carmot_uuid":"4626c09f-fc2f-356c-b5d6-78786b62b30c"},"categories":[25515,20429,17396,35394854],"tags":[576734528,576700741,576740177,183,576707652],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[576796353,576796357],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/GettyImages-157530211.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/33zJ3TS","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"featured":false,"subtitle":"","fundingRound":false,"seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","premiumContent":true,"premiumCutoffPercent":0.21,"tc_cb_mapping":[{"slug":"rahul-vohra","cb_name":"Rahul Vohra","cb_slug":"rahul-vohra-person","cb_link":"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/rahul-vohra"}],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[2047686],"hideFeaturedImage":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2047691"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2047691"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2047691\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2047816,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2047691\/revisions\/2047816"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/rahul-vohra"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2047691&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/133574325"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1930999"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2047691"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2047691"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2047691"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2047691"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2047691"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2047691"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2047691"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":2047686,"name":"Rahul Vohra","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/rahul-vohra\/","description":"Rahul Vohra is the founder and CEO of email app Superhuman.","slug":"rahul-vohra","links":{"twitter":"rahulvohra"},"position":"Contributor","cbDescription":"Rahul Vohra is the founder and CEO of email app Superhuman.","cbAvatar":"","twitter":"rahulvohra"}],"author":[{"id":133574325,"name":"Walter Thompson","url":"https:\/\/anchor.fm\/thegoldencity","description":"Senior Editor Walter Thompson manages Extra Crunch and TechCrunch's guest post program.

But if you\u2019re just entering the job market, you may end up with reliable income and a low limit on your credit card. <a href=\"https:\/\/x1creditcard.com\">X1 Card<\/a> wants to solve that by setting limits based on your current and future income instead of your credit score.<\/p>\n<p>The company says some customers can expect limits up to five times higher than what they would get from a traditional credit card. And that limit can move up if you get a promotion at your job, for instance.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe consumer credit card industry has been almost untouched by tech and has relied on the archaic credit score system. Max [Levchin], David [Sacks] and I have similar scores \u2014 that makes no sense!\u201d co-founder Deepak Rao told me. \u201cWe reimagined the credit card from the ground up to have smarter limits, intelligent features, modern rewards and a new look.\u201d<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Depending on your creditworthiness, you\u2019ll get a variable APR of 12.9 to 19.9% and a balance transfer fee of 2%. There\u2019s no annual subscription fee and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/x1-card\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"x1-card\">X1 Card <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> doesn\u2019t change any late fee or foreign transaction fee.<\/p>\n<p>Behind the scene, X1 Card is built by Thrive, the company that created <a href=\"https:\/\/thrivecash.com\">ThriveCash<\/a>, a loan platform that lets you get a credit line based on offer letters for an upcoming summer internship or your first full-time job after college.<\/p>\n<p>You can then borrow as much as 25% of your total internship salary or 25% of your first three paychecks if it\u2019s a full-time job. There are some fees, but it can be helpful if you\u2019re signing a new lease and you don\u2019t have any money on your bank account, for instance.<\/p>\n<p>Thrive has raised $10.25 million in funding from PayPal and Affirm founder Max Levchin, former Twitter COO <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/adam-bain\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"adam-bain\">Adam Bain, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Craft Ventures general partner David Sacks and others.

It helps you track your subscriptions in different ways. First, you can cancel your subscription payments from the app. If you\u2019re trying out a new service and they require you to enter your credit card information to start a free trial, you can also generate an auto-expiring virtual credit card.<\/p>\n<p>If you receive a refund, X1 Card sends you a notification. You can also attach receipts to your transaction in the app.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to rewards, X1 Card uses points. You get 2x points on all purchases by default \u2014 there&#8217;s no category or retailers that give you special rewards. If you spend more than $15,000 using the card in a year, you get 3X points. If you refer a friend, you get 4X points on your purchases for a month \u2014 each new referral adds an extra month with 4X points. Points can be redeemed at retail partners, such as Apple, Airbnb, Delta, Everlane, etc.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, it&#8217;s a credit card. But what makes this product more interesting than your average Chase-branded card is that it wants to disrupt the credit score system. It&#8217;s going to be interesting to see if people can really get higher limits with that system.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2037623\" style=\"width: 980px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2037623\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical size-full wp-image-2037623\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Rewards-Screen.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"970\" height=\"1760\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Rewards-Screen.png 970w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Rewards-Screen.png?resize=83,150 83w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Rewards-Screen.png?resize=165,300 165w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Rewards-Screen.png?resize=768,1393 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Rewards-Screen.png?resize=375,680 375w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Rewards-Screen.png?resize=847,1536 847w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Rewards-Screen.png?resize=28,50 28w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2037623\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image credits: X1 Card<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are many reasons why you could have a good or a bad credit score.

It\u2019s a special circumstance attributable to the virtual nature of this week\u2019s event.<\/p>\n<p>Simply put, it has given me significantly more time than I would traditionally get amid the press scrum after an <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> event, but not nearly enough to feel comfortable calling this a full review.

Given how many of these things Apple has sold \u2014 and how the company continues to dominate the category \u2014 it\u2019s easy enough to understand why it hasn\u2019t messed too much with the formula here. That goes double for the lower-cost SE, which has a lot of common DNA with the discontinued Series 5.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2047920\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2047920\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2047920\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-16-061908197.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-16-061908197.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-16-061908197.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-16-061908197.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-16-061908197.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-16-061908197.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-16-061908197.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-16-061908197.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2047920\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>There are some new case colors, however. Blue and a new (Product)RED join silver, space gray and gold aluminum. Apple sent the former, and honestly, I\u2019m a bit surprised at how subtle and deep the blue is. In most lighting, the color looks more like a blueish hue than a louder shade. For most users, that\u2019s probably for the best. The deep blue is something more appropriate for a wider range of situations. From what I\u2019ve seen, the red is a bit louder \u2014 more akin to the color on (Product)RED iPhones.<\/p>\n<p>And there\u2019s always the bands if you really want to stand out. It continues to be a proprietary design, but there are a ton of choices on the market at this point \u2014 and a lot of third-party options (though I admit I recently had a bad experience with one that tore after a week or so). Solo Loop is probably the biggest addition on the band front, removing the buckle\/Velcro from the equation.<\/p>\n<p>There are two primary styles (and a bunch of different colors). I\u2019m partial to the braided version. It more closely resembles the fabric bands I prefer, while adding a little additional design into the mix. I\u2019m less of a fan of the straight-up silicone model \u2014 I\u2019ve never really been a fan of the rubbery silicon bands. The Loops are nice and stretchy, but you\u2019ll still want to find which of the 12 sizes best fits you. You can measure and approximate from home, but honestly, it\u2019s going to be a lot easier to deal with when more Apple Stores open for in-person sizing.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"cLpRk65KBE\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/15\/apple-introduces-the-apple-watch-se-a-cheaper-apple-watch\/\">Apple introduces the Apple Watch SE, a cheaper Apple Watch<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Apple introduces the Apple Watch SE, a cheaper Apple Watch&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/15\/apple-introduces-the-apple-watch-se-a-cheaper-apple-watch\/embed\/#?secret=cLpRk65KBE\" data-secret=\"cLpRk65KBE\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The biggest addition for the Series 6 on the hardware front is a blood oxygen sensor. Apple\u2019s hardly the first smartwatch maker to offer the functionality, but it arrives at a key time, when more people are tuned into such numbers amid COVID-19. Here\u2019s how Apple describes it,<\/p>\n<p>The new blood oxygen sensor is made up of four LED clusters and four photodiodes. Incorporated into the completely redesigned back crystal, this new sensor works in concert with the Blood Oxygen app to determine your blood oxygen level. The testing will work in the background, or you can enable it through the app. The process takes about 15 seconds, though there are a lot of variables that can mess up a reading, including how much you move and the tightness and placement of your band. I found myself having to repeat it a couple of times to get a good reading.<\/p>\n<p>It would be great if Apple offered up more contextual information about what blood oxygen levels actually mean. I assume a vast majority of people don\u2019t know what constitutes a healthy level. It\u2019s a tricky line to walk, however. Healthy levels vary from person to person, and Apple certainly doesn\u2019t want to position itself as diagnosing people. The company did, however, mention COVID-19 a few times with regard to health monitoring.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2047916\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2047916\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2047916 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-16-061940318.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-16-061940318.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-16-061940318.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-16-061940318.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-16-061940318.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-16-061940318.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-16-061940318.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-16-061940318.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2047916\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>It is participating in some early studies, but again, for obvious reasons, it can&#8217;t come out and say it\u2019s going to diagnose you with the condition. Rather, like the rest of the vitals, it can offer early detection of potential underlying problems. The SE, meanwhile, drops ECG monitoring altogether, which may or may not be worth the price differential, depending on what you\u2019re looking to get out of such a device.<\/p>\n<p>My biggest disappointment with Tuesday\u2019s news (and the hands-on thus far) is that the battery life hasn\u2019t changed much.

The company has stated, however that the S6 processor is more battery efficient than its predecessor. The Watch can also be charged faster, with a full charging in around 90 minutes, which should help with topping up before bed.<\/p>\n<p>Looking forward into more depth with sleep tracking and fitness features soon (though the Fitness+ service will sadly have to wait a bit). I have exactly one night with the Watch under my belt. I apparently slept seven hours and 31 minutes &#8212; which is surprisingly good for me. Chalk it up to Disrupt\/Apple week exhaustion. The tracking is pretty basic so far, though I imagine it will offer a fuller picture over time. Right now it&#8217;s limited to time in bed and time asleep, attached to iOS&#8217;s new bed time features. It will also show you what your heart rate looked like over the course of the night.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"2LazxKtyb7\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/29\/apple-began-work-on-the-watchs-hand-washing-feature-years-before-covid-19\/\">Apple began work on the Watch\u2019s handwashing feature years before COVID-19<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Apple began work on the Watch\u2019s handwashing feature years before COVID-19&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/29\/apple-began-work-on-the-watchs-hand-washing-feature-years-before-covid-19\/embed\/#?secret=2LazxKtyb7\" data-secret=\"2LazxKtyb7\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The hand-washing feature introduced with watchOS 7 works reasonably well, though there\u2019s still so much variation in bathroom acoustics and sinks it can sometimes be an issue, even while listening for the sound of soap squishing between your fingers. For instance, it had a little trouble with my bathroom sink, but was happy to start the 15-second countdown when I wash my hands (or the dishes) in the sink. The Health app collects hand washing metrics over time, including the average time washed and the number of times per day. It&#8217;s an odd thing to see mapped out, but Apple&#8217;s timing couldn&#8217;t have have been better.<\/p>\n<p>So far, the Series 6 isn\u2019t a giant leap forward, but it\u2019s nice to see Apple taking health more and more seriously \u2014 and again, it\u2019s going to be great to revisit the hardware when Fitness+ drops. The Series 6 is available starting Friday at $499 for the cellular version and $399 without. The SE, meanwhile is $329 and $279, respectively, while the old standby Series 3 starts at an extremely accessible $199.<\/p>\n<p>The new Watches go on sale tomorrow.

href=\"https:\/\/www.gfi.org\/industry\">The Good Food Institute<\/a>, which is tracking the growth of investments into sustainable foods. The report identified fermentation technologies as a rising third pillar of foundational technologies on which new and established food brands are making products that swap out animal products for other protein sources.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fermentation technologies, which use microbes like microalgae and mycoprotein, can produce biomass, improve plant proteins and create new functional ingredients, and companies developing and deploying these technologies have raised $435 million in funding through the end of July 2020. It&#8217;s an indication of how competitive the market is for food technologies, representing an increase of nearly 60% over the $274 million invested in all of 2019, according to GFI.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cFermentation is powering a new wave of alternative protein products with huge potential for improving flavor, sustainability, and production efficiency. Investors and innovators are recognizing this market potential, leading to a surge of activity in fermentation as an enabling platform for the alternative protein industry as a whole,&#8221; said GFI Associate Director of Science and Technology Liz Specht, in a statement. &#8220;And this is just the beginning: The opportunity landscape for technology development is completely untapped in this area. Many alternative protein products of the future will harness the plethora of protein production methods now available, with the option of leveraging combinations of proteins derived from plants, animal cell culture, and microbial fermentation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><div id=\"attachment_2043056\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2043056\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2043056\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/GettyImages-1205758678.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/GettyImages-1205758678.jpg 2121w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/GettyImages-1205758678.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/GettyImages-1205758678.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/GettyImages-1205758678.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/GettyImages-1205758678.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/GettyImages-1205758678.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/GettyImages-1205758678.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/GettyImages-1205758678.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2043056\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Portrait of the head of an adult black and white cow, gentle look, pink nose, in front of a blue sky. <strong>Image Credit:\u00a0<\/strong>Getty Images<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As the $1.5. billion figure indicates, big-time investors are taking notice.

On the one hand, biomass fermentation can create nutritious, clean protein in a highly efficient and low-cost way. On the other hand, the potential for precision fermentation to produce value-added, highly functional and nutritious ingredients is very exciting and could revolutionize the plant-based category,&#8221; said Rosie Wardle, an investor with the CPT Capital, which specializes in backing startups developing novel protein production technologies. &#8220;From an investment perspective, we are very excited about the white space opportunities in this category, and we are actively looking to increase our investments in the space. This new report from GFI is the first comprehensive overview of fermentation for alternative protein applications and should be required reading for everyone who wants to create a more efficient and less harmful global food system.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Companies like Perfect Day, Impossible Foods and a host of other startups that are developing replacements for animal-farmed goods used in food, clothes, cosmetics and chemicals have raised a whopping $1.5 billion through the first half of the year.

By enabling faster, longer, and higher quality DNA synthesis with their fully enzymatic process, Ansa will help accelerate the entire synthetic biology industry.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Arlow likens the state of the industry now to the early days of programming. &#8220;If it took three weeks to compile your code or recompile your code to make a simple change you could never make any progress in developing software for the computer,&#8221; Arlow said. And that&#8217;s the state for programmable biology these days.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;It took a really long time to test your idea after it was designed. It forces you to plan things out much more carefully and to be less spontaneous and less agile,&#8221; he said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Using Ansa, companies can have DNA made based on their specific requirements at a speed and scale that Arlow said other companies in the market can&#8217;t match.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"TcqSn79qcL\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/daphne-koller-digital-biology-is-an-incredible-place-to-be-right-now\/\">Daphne Koller: &#8216;Digital biology is an incredible place to be right now&#8217;<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Daphne Koller: &#8216;Digital biology is an incredible place to be right now&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/daphne-koller-digital-biology-is-an-incredible-place-to-be-right-now\/embed\/#?secret=TcqSn79qcL\" data-secret=\"TcqSn79qcL\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Currently, DNA molecules are made using a thirty year-old chemical method that has limitations on the length of molecules that can be made. By contrast, Ansa&#8217;s biologically inspired DNA synthesis method means that the company can make long molecules directly, without the risk of errors that can result from patching pieces of genetic material together.<\/p>\n<p>The company has developed an enzyme that basically adds bases to a DNA molecule. The company basically has a cut and paste function that serves to unblock DNA and then allows another base to be attached.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also important to note that Arlow&#8217;s company is doing synthesis as a service rather than selling bioprinters that can enable any researcher to make their own DNA.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the reasons we&#8217;re developing our business as a DNA synthesis service&#8230; as opposed to making a printer&#8230; is because that gives us a much greater ability to vet orders for biosecurity risk before we manufacture them,&#8221; Arlow said.<\/p>\n<p>Other companies like <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/dna-script\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"dna-script\">DNA Script <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> (from France) and Nuclera (a Cambridge, UK-based company) are going to market with bioprinters that they&#8217;re selling directly to research labs, according to Arlow.<\/p>\n<p>All of these businesses are the next iteration of companies like <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/twist-biosciences\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"twist-biosciences\">Twist Bioscience, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> that are manufacturing DNA to power the synthetic biology revolution (something that TechCrunch Disrupt attendees have been hearing a lot about).<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"1gpOw4QQe2\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/video\/crispr-in-the-post-covid-era\/\">CRISPR in the post-COVID Era<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;CRISPR in the post-COVID Era&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/video\/crispr-in-the-post-covid-era\/embed\/#?secret=1gpOw4QQe2\" data-secret=\"1gpOw4QQe2\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Ansa hasn&#8217;t shipped any DNA yet, but the company will soon be taking orders to begin competing in a market that Arlow estimates is over $1 billion today and is growing quite rapidly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;Writing is really the bottleneck,&#8221; Arlow said. &#8220;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The business we\u2019re in is selling to R&amp;D.. the faster we can crank out the DNA the better it is.

So how does a hot startup keep its edge?<\/p>\n<p>As part of this year&#8217;s virtual Disrupt, we sat down to talk with the company&#8217;s founder and CEO, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/ilkka-paananen\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"ilkka-paananen\">Ilkka Paananen, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> about that and the other challenges and opportunities facing the company, and asked for his tips and opinion on spinning up and running startups in Europe today.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Times are definitely not easy right now: all of us are living through a global health pandemic, and economies as a result of that are teetering; and there is an interesting sea change happening as gaming companies (along with other content makers) face off against big tech, where there&#8217;s a question of whether platforms or the games themselves have the upper hand. (The most visible and recent example of that: the counter-lawsuits between Epic and Apple over in-app payments.)<\/p>\n<p>For <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/supercell\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"supercell\">Supercell <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> specifically, its majority owner, Tencent, is in hot water in the U.S. (a major market for Supercell); and it&#8217;s sitting on a still-popular but now-ageing game franchise that you could argue is in the middle of its own Battle Royale against the many other big games that are vying for people&#8217;s attention (and spending power to keep playing and levelling up). In short, the company itself, now 10 years old, may itself be facing more existential questions of who are we now, and what comes next?<\/p>\n<p>As you&#8217;ll see in the video below, Paananen is very sanguine and calm, which is to say quite Finnish, about a lot of this.<\/p>\n<p>Even without the experience thus far of Supercell under his belt, he has been in the industry for years. Supercell is his second big hit company: before that he founded Sumea, which was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/articles\/digital-chocolate-purchases-sumea\/1100-6101256\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">acquired by Digital Chocolate<\/a>, where he became president in the now-defunct bigger studio&#8217;s heyday. And, he has been and is an investor, too: most recently Paananen backed Zwift, the gamefied home fitness startup, in its most recent, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/zwift-maker-of-a-popular-indoor-training-app-just-landed-a-whopping-450-million-in-funding-led-by-kkr\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$450 million round<\/a>, which included him joining the company&#8217;s board. All of this is to say that he can see the bigger picture.<\/p>\n<p>The Tencent issues in the U.S., he said, are something that the company is watching. But not only are they unresolved &#8212; indeed just this week, ahead of any proposed bans on Tencent properties and WeChat in particular, the U.S. government <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-09-16\/wechat-users-won-t-be-targeted-by-trump-s-order-u-s-says\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">issued more clarification<\/a> on how people are liable for using WeChat. In any case, Paananen said in the interview that he believes that Supercell doesn&#8217;t fall under the U.S. executive order to be shut down, because Tencent is only a shareholder, not a full owner. He&#8217;s still waiting to see how it all plays out.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our current understanding [is that] it&#8217;s about WeChat not Tencent as a whole,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and that it doesn&#8217;t apply to Tencent-invested companies like Supercell.&#8221; (Also: one of the good things to have come out of not getting fully acquired, it seems.)<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, Paananen is not overly concerned about the fact that its big hit, while still one of the highest-grossing apps globally, is getting on and slowly bringing in fewer revenues.<\/p>\n<p>Judging by the fact that Supercell has yet to follow up with another successful franchise, and has killed quite a few attempts in the meantime, the process to produce a hit, in fact, still seems to be as elusive to a company that has produced a hit already as it is to those that have not.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It would be nice to be always on this kind of a growth curve, but the reality is&#8230; it&#8217;s very much about hits or misses,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Sometimes figures go up, and sometimes they go down [so] what&#8217;s your time horizon? We never ever think about the next quarter, and very, very rarely think about it and maybe next year, I think that&#8217;s a target in itself, you know. We try to think in decades. Our dream is to build a game so as many people as possible will play for a very long time. We are inspired by companies like, say, Nintendo. And if you&#8217;re going to take that&#8230; then that changes your perspective.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The company has been building out its options, though, making about three investments a year in other gaming startups, and some full acquisitions of studios, to diversify the team and bring in more options for new games in the future. Later in the Q&amp;A with viewers, Paananen said Supercell has no plans yet for anything in AR or VR, with a firm belief that mobile, and the mechanics of a touch screen, are the best for what it&#8217;s building.<\/p>\n<p>It seems the most valuable lesson Paananen has learned, it turns out, is the thing that continues to be his top priority: building the right team for the long haul.<\/p>\n<p>Making sure you have a group that can work together, inspire each other and be productive has been the constant, one that perhaps means even more as the company grows bigger and we continue to work under very decentralised circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are currently on the look-out for people from all around the world to join Supercell to build the best teams and then of course the best games,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Hear about all this, plus Paananen&#8217;s opinion on raising money, and more, below.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_1\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f5c0f26b65dff2c9a07d8d9\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=1\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mobile games maker Supercell has been one of the great, understated breakthroughs of the European startup world.

He&#8217;s the CEO and co-founder of <a href=\"http:\/\/Lidya.co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lidya<\/a>, a startup out of Nigeria that has built a platform for SMBs to apply for and get loans and other financial services, aimed at markets on the African continent and increasingly also in emerging economies in Europe. We sat down with him as part of our new virtual Disrupt series, where we have been connecting with some of the biggest movers and shakers in the tech world beyond the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>Kehinde has been called the &#8220;Jeff Bezos of Africa,&#8221; a funny title you might think sounds like tenuous or cheesy marketing until you know more about his history in business and the impact it&#8217;s had so far (he&#8217;s not that old) in the region &#8212; and until you hear him speak.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Kehinde &#8212; born in Nigeria and exposed to a lot of the U.S. way of doing things through university years at Howard and then Harvard &#8212; was previously the co-founder of one of the biggest tech startups to have come out of the continent &#8212; <a href=\"http:\/\/jumia.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jumia<\/a>\u00a0&#8212; an Amazon-style marketplace that is slowly branching out into a wider web of services like payments, food delivery and more.<\/p>\n<p>Initially incubated by Rocket Internet, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/jumia\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"jumia\">Jumia <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> raised hundreds of millions of dollars from VCs, scaled to multiple countries on the continent and is now traded publicly on Nasdaq with a current market cap of $660 million &#8212; modest by Amazon standards maybe, but a real milestone for African tech.<\/p>\n<p>That alone would probably cause some to wonder if he&#8217;s the &#8220;next Bezos,&#8221; but it&#8217;s been his follow-up act at <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/lidya\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"lidya\">Lidya <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> that paints a broader picture. In short, there is a lot more potential for payment and online commerce services in emerging markets, and focusing on helping small businesses cross the digital chasm is not just a good business opportunity, but a developmental one, too. Capital, specifically the lack thereof, has always been a huge hindrance to growth, and these days it&#8217;s an even more critical axiom to address.<\/p>\n<p>You can see the full Disrupt conversation below, where Kehinde covers a lot of ground, not just about his company but about how tech is evolving in the region.<\/p>\n<p>The breakout success of a handful of startups &#8212; which include the likes of new digital payments unicorn <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/11\/nigerias-interswitch-confirms-1b-valuation-after-visa-investment\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interswitch<\/a> as well as Jumia &#8212; venturing into multiple jurisdictions, he noted, is seeing more VCs also increase their interest and investment activity.

rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SmartNews<\/a> took on a major challenge. After launching in Japan in 2012, the news discovery app decided that its first international market would be the United States. During Disrupt 2020, co-founder Kaisei Hamamoto talked about how <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/smartnews-inc\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"smartnews-inc\">SmartNews <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> adapts its app for two very different markets (the video is embedded below). Hamamoto, who is also chief operating officer and chief engineer of the startup, which <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/08\/04\/news-discovery-app-smartnews-valued-at-1-1b\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hit unicorn status last year<\/a>, also dove into how the company deals with media polarization, especially in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>At Disrupt, SmartNews announced a roster of major new features for the U.S. version of the app, including sections dedicated to voting information and articles related to local and national elections. Hamamoto said the SmartNews\u2019 goal is to make the app a &#8220;one-stop solution for users\u2019 participation in the election process.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Vswu4zWlh6\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/smartnews-u-s-app-unveils-new-features-for-the-elections-covid-19-and-local-weather\/\">SmartNews&#8217; U.S. app unveils new features for the elections, COVID-19 and local weather<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;SmartNews&#8217; U.S. app unveils new features for the elections, COVID-19 and local weather&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/smartnews-u-s-app-unveils-new-features-for-the-elections-covid-19-and-local-weather\/embed\/#?secret=Vswu4zWlh6\" data-secret=\"Vswu4zWlh6\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The media landscape has changed a lot since SmartNews was founded in 2012. In the U.S., SmartNews is tackling the same issues as many journalists are: increasing polarization, especially along political lines, and monetization (SmartNews currently has more than 3,000 publishing partners around the world and splits ad revenue with them). And, of course, it&#8217;s up against a host of new competitors, including Apple News and Google News.<\/p>\n<p>While many Japanese startups focus on other Asian markets when expanding internationally, SmartNews decided to enter the United States because it is home to some of the most influential media companies in the world. On the engineering side, Hamamoto said the company also wanted to tap into the country\u2019s AI and machine learning talent pool.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The U.S. is not only an attractive market, but also an important development center for SmartNews,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>The Japanese and American versions of SmartNews share the same code base, and its offices in both countries work closely together. While the company&#8217;s machine learning-based algorithms drive the bulk of news discovery and personalized recommendations, publishers are first screened by SmartNews&#8217; content team before being added to its platform. The company&#8217;s vice president of content is Rich Jaroslovsky, a veteran journalist who wrote for publications like Bloomberg News and The Wall Street Journal.<\/p>\n<p>While AI-based algorithms can perform tasks like filtering out obscene images, &#8220;it does not have the ability to evaluate how each publisher meets certain standards,&#8221; Hamamoto said. &#8220;We are doing everything we can to ensure that our users can read the news with trust every day thanks to efforts led by our team of journalism experts.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3>Breaking readers out of information bubbles<\/h3>\n<p>In addition to their code base, the two versions of the app share some of the same features. For example, each has SmartNews\u2019 COVID-19 channel, with continuous updates about the pandemic. In the States, this includes visualizations of confirmed cases by county or state, and information about local closing or reopening orders.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of adapting the apps&#8217; user experience, Hamamoto said Japanese readers prefer to have a lot of news displayed on one screen, so it uses a layout algorithm that deliberately increases the density of information presented in its Japanese app. But testing showed Americans prefer a simpler, cleaner layout with more white space.<\/p>\n<p>But the differences go beyond the apps&#8217; user interface. In 2016, members of the U.S. and Japanese team spent three weeks traveling across 13 states, including Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas, to talk to people they met through Craigslist postings or in diners and cafes. SmartNews\u2019 leaders decided to do this after the Japan team realized that most of their U.S. trips were to their offices in New York and the Bay Area.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We knew we couldn\u2019t get a get a true sense of America by only visiting the East Coast and West Coast,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Hamamoto said one of his biggest takeaways from the 2016 trip was that &#8220;we tend to categorize people into just two segments, our side or the other side, and we tend to think of the other side as the enemy, but in reality the world is not that simple.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In a bid to tackle political polarization in American media, the company <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/09\/16\/smartnews-latest-news-discovery-feature-shows-users-articles-from-across-the-political-spectrum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">launched a &#8220;News from All Sides&#8221;<\/a> feature last year, that displays articles about one topic from publications displayed on a slider from &#8220;most conservative&#8221; to &#8220;most liberal.&#8221; The U.S. app<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/03\/smartnews-local-news-feature-now-covers-more-than-6000-u-s-cities\/\"> also has a stronger emphasis on local news<\/a>. Based on users\u2019 locations, this can be as specific as information from county or even city news outlets.<\/p>\n<p>Hamamoto added that one of SmartNews&#8217; guiding principles is a belief that &#8220;having a willingness to listen to other people and not easily label them will help solve the division of our society.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f5c0f26b65dff2c9a07d8ed\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Six years ago, SmartNews took on a major challenge.
