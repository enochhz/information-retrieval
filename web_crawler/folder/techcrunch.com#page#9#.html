But on this record \u2014 while the government has established that China\u2019s activities raise significant national- security concerns \u2014 it has put in scant little evidence that its effective ban of WeChat for all U.S. users addresses those concerns. And, as the plaintiffs point out, there are obvious alternatives to a complete ban, such as barring WeChat from government devices, as Australia has done, or taking other steps to address data security.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Given the likelihood of a lawsuit proceeding and the immediate damage a ban would have if implemented, the judge initiated a nationwide injunction against implementation of the Commerce Department\u2019s order to ban the app.<\/p>\n<p>Commerce will have a chance to respond to this development, and whether it chooses to edit its order, pursue other avenues through the courts, or just rescind the order entirely, we will see in the coming days.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A few days ago, the U.S. Commerce Department published a series of rules that aimed to block the downloading of TikTok and WeChat by American users, following an executive order signed by President Trump back in August.

Users collected these cricket-themed stickers for sending money to others, or making transactions such as topping up credit on their phone or paying their broadband or electricity bill.<\/p>\n<p>In a statement on Sunday evening, a Google spokesperson said, \u201coffering cashbacks and vouchers alone do not constitute a violation of our Google Play gambling policies\u201d and that Play Store \u201cpolicies are applied and enforced on all developers consistently.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But it\u2019s arguably anything but consistent.<\/p>\n<p>On September 18, Google told Paytm that it had pulled its app for not complying with Play Store\u2019s \u201cgambling policy\u201d as it offered games with \u201cloyalty points.\u201d Paytm said that Google had not expressed any concerns over Paytm\u2019s new marketing campaign prior to its notice on Friday, in which it revealed that Paytm app had been temporarily removed from the Play Store.<\/p>\n<p>But Google itself is running a similar campaign linked to cricket in India, Paytm argues. (Why cricket? Cricket is immensely popular in India and one of the biggest cricket tournaments globally, Indian Premier League, kicked off its latest season on Saturday.)<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2049284\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2049284\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2049284 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"286\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg 3284w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=150,42 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=300,84 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=768,214 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=680,190 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=1536,428 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=2048,571 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=50,14 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2049284\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cricket-themed cashback offered by Paytm (left) and Google Pay (right) in India<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Google Play Store in India has long prohibited apps that promote gambling such as betting on sporting events, and Google has raised concerns about Paytm&#8217;s marquee app promoting Paytm First Games, a fantasy sports app run by Paytm, in the past.<\/p>\n<p>Paytm executives argued that <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/phonepe\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"phonepe\">PhonePe, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> a Walmart-owned payments app in India, also promoted Dream11, the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/indian-fantasy-sports-app-dream11s-parent-firm-raises-225m-at-over-2-5b-valuation\/\">most popular fantasy sports app in the country<\/a>, and got away without any action.<\/p>\n<p>Google also permits fantasy sports app operators &#8212; including Paytm &#8212; to advertise on Search in India.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-theme=\"light\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Where is Google hypocritical?

The removal of Paytm app was only on the grounds of Paytm offering cricket-themed cashback, he claimed. \u201cGoogle is not allowing us to acquire new customers right now. That\u2019s all what this is,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s payments app, Google Pay, competes with Paytm in India. In fact, Google Pay is the largest payments app for peer-to-peer transaction between users in India and holds the largest market share in UPI.<\/p>\n<p>Without identifying any names, Sharma, the poster child of Indian startup ecosystem, claimed that many founders in India have just accepted that it is Google that has the final say on any matter in India &#8212; and not the country\u2019s regulatory agencies.<\/p>\n<p>For Google, which reaches more users than any other company in India and whose Android operating system commands 99% of the local smartphone market, this kind of accusation is exactly what it needs to avoid in the country. The Silicon Valley search and advertising giant has launched a charm offensive in India, including a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/13\/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india\/\">recently commitment to invest $10 billion<\/a> &#8212;\u00a0more than any other American or Chinese technology firm.<\/p>\n<p>The timing for Google&#8217;s parent company, Alphabet, couldn&#8217;t be worse. Google is currently the <a href=\"https:\/\/in.reuters.com\/article\/us-india-google-antitrust-exclusive\/exclusive-google-faces-antitrust-case-in-india-over-payments-app-sources-idUKKBN2331G3\">subject of an antitrust complaint<\/a> in India over an allegation that it has abused its market position to unfairly promote its mobile payments app in the country; and in the U.S., Congress has intimidated that it may pursue antitrust regulatory action against Alphabet and Apple over app store concerns.<\/p>\n<p>In India, Google&#8217;s moves could have a devastating impact on businesses and everyday consumers.<\/p>\n<p>Paytm is not just a payments app. It is also a fully licensed digital bank. And just an eight-hour of absence from the Play Store created a panic among a portion of its users. A source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that Paytm saw several people withdraw their fixed deposit in Paytm Payments Bank on Friday.<\/p>\n<p>Anecdotally, TechCrunch heard of instances where vendors who previously preferred Paytm for accepting money digitally asked their customers to use a different payments method as they had heard that Paytm was \u201cbanned\u201d in India.<\/p>\n<p>Sharma said Google&#8217;s monopoly on Indian app ecosystem is of a magnitude unparalleled elsewhere in the world.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf paying someone and getting a cashback is gambling, then the same rule should be applied to everyone,\u201d said Sharma. \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful that we are standing here at the cusp of an internet revolution in India and we are being sanctioned by companies that are not governed by the law of this country.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If this sentiment gained traction in India it could create challenges for Google&#8217;s future in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. is forcing a Chinese company to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/19\/tiktok-deal-terms\/\">sell stakes to local firms to continue operations in the country<\/a>. In a recent episode of Dithering podcast, Ben Thompson cautioned that Trump administration\u2019s move &#8212; which some have argued is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/08\/18\/opinion\/tiktok-wechat-ban-trump.html\">a long due tit for tat against Chinese companies<\/a> (as China has long prevented U.S. firms from meaningfully operating in the world&#8217;s largest \u00a0internet market) &#8212;\u00a0might encourage\u00a0other open markets to do to American firms what it is doing to TikTok.<\/p>\n<p>Several U.S. tech executives share these concerns.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The problem with this TikTok deal is that the US is the largest player in tech globally.

capitalism and the American theft of Chinese innovation"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">It used to be \u201ceasy\u201d to tell the American and Chinese economies apart. One was innovative, one made clones. One was a free market while the other demanded payments to a political party and its leadership, a corrupt wealth generating scam that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/business\/global\/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html\">by some estimates<\/a> has netted top leaders billions of dollars. One kept the talent borders porous acting as a magnet for the world\u2019s top brains while the other interviewed you in a backroom at the airport before imprisoning you on sedition charges (okay, that might have been both).<\/p>\n<p>The comparison was always facile yes, but it was easy and at least directionally accurate if failing on the specifics.<\/p>\n<p>Now though, the country that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2019\/04\/lithium-ion-batteries-amazon-are-exploding\/587005\/\">exported exploding batteries<\/a> is pioneering quantum computing, while the country that pioneered the internet <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/03\/made-in-america-is-on-government-life-support-and-the-prognosis-isnt-good\/\">now builds planes that fall out of the sky<\/a> (and good news, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/boeing-flags-additional-787-production-problem-11599577936\">we\u2019ve identified even more planes<\/a> that might fall out of the sky at an airport near you!)<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tiktok\">TikTok\u2019s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> success is many things, but it is quite frankly just an embarrassment for the United States. There are thousands of entrepreneurs and hundreds of venture capitalists swarming Silicon Valley and the other American innovation hubs looking for the next great social app or building it themselves. But the power law of user growth and investor returns happens to reside in Haidian, Beijing. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/bytedance\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"bytedance\">ByteDance <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> through its local apps in China and overseas apps like TikTok <i>is<\/i> the consumer investor return of the past decade (there\u2019s a reason why all the IPOs this seasons are enterprise SaaS).<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a win that you can\u2019t chalk up just to industrial policy. Unlike in semiconductors or other capital-intensive industries where Beijing can offer billions in incentives to spur development, ByteDance builds apps. It distributes them on app stores across the world. It has exactly the same tools available to it that every entrepreneur with an Apple Developer account has access to. There is no <a href=\"https:\/\/www.csis.org\/analysis\/made-china-2025\">Made in China 2025<\/a> plan to build and popularize a consumer app like TikTok (you literally can\u2019t plan for consumer success like that). Instead, it\u2019s a well-executed product that\u2019s addictive to hundreds of millions of people.<\/p>\n<p>So much as China protected its industry from overseas competitors like Google and Amazon through market-entry barriers, America is now protecting its entrenched incumbents from overseas competitors like TikTok. We\u2019re demanding joint ventures and local cloud data sovereignty just as the Communist Party has demanded for years.<\/p>\n<p>Hell, we\u2019re apparently demanding a $5 billion tax payment from ByteDance, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-09-20\/trump-wants-5-billion-from-tiktok-deal-for-new-history-project\">which the president says will fund patriotic education for youth<\/a>. The president says a lot of things of course, but at least the $5 billion price point has been confirmed by Oracle in its press release over night (what the tax revenue will <i>actually<\/i> be used for is anyone\u2019s guess). If you followed the recent Hong Kong protests for a long time, you will remember that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-hongkong-patriotism\/hong-kong-frets-over-china-model-patriotic-education-idUSBRE86A09L20120711\">patriotic youth education<\/a> was some of the original tinder for those demonstrations back in 2012. What comes around, goes around, I guess.<\/p>\n<p>Development economists like to talk about \u201ccatch-up\u201d strategies, tactics that countries can take to avoid the middle income trap and cut the gap between the West and the rest. But what we need now are developed economists to explain America\u2019s \u201cfall behind\u201d strategy. Because we are falling behind, in pretty much everything.<\/p>\n<p>As the TikTok process and the earlier Huawei imbroglio show, America is no longer on the leading edge of technology in many key strategic markets. Mainland Chinese companies are globally winning in areas as diverse as 5G and social networks, and without direct government intervention to kill that innovation, American and European tech purveyors would have lost those markets entirely (and even <i>with<\/i> those interventions, they may still lose them). In Taiwan, TSMC has come from behind Intel to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/051b2c80-d53b-410e-8e80-f433d25a82dd\">take a year or two lead<\/a> in the fabrication of the most advanced semiconductors.<\/p>\n<p>I mean, we can\u2019t even pilfer Chinese history and mythology and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/21428088\/mulan-review-disney-live-action-remake\">turn it into a decent god damn film<\/a> these days.<\/p>\n<p>And the fall-behind strategy continues. Immigration restrictions from an administration hell-bent on destroying the single greatest source of American innovation, coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic, have fused into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/international-student-enrollment-trump-covid19-5caad69c-f6d4-4b79-bfb4-7b6ed038bc5b.html\">the largest single drop in international student migration in American history<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Why does that matter? In the U.S. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.insidehighered.com\/quicktakes\/2017\/10\/11\/foreign-students-and-graduate-stem-enrollment\">according to relatively recent data<\/a>, 81% of electrical engineering grad students are international, 79% in computer science are, and in most engineering and technical fields, the number hovers above a majority.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s great to believe the fantasy that if only these international grad students would stay home, then \u201creal\u201d Americans would somehow take these slots. But what\u2019s true of the strawberry pickers and food service workers is also true for EE grad students: proverbial \u201cAmericans\u201d don\u2019t want these jobs. They are hard jobs, thankless jobs, and require a ridiculous tenacity that American workers and students by and large don\u2019t have. These industries have huge contingents of foreign workers precisely because no one domestic wants to take these roles.<\/p>\n<p>So goes the talent, so goes the innovation. Without this wellspring of brainpower lodging itself in America\u2019s top innovation hubs, where exactly do we think it will go? That former aspiring Stanford or MIT computer scientist with ideas in his or her brain isn\u2019t just going to sit by the window gazing at the horizon waiting for the moment when they can enter the gilded halls of the U.S. of A. It\u2019s the internet era, and they are just going to get started on their dreams wherever they are, using whatever tools and resources they have available to them.<\/p>\n<p>All you have to do is look at the recent YC batches and realize that the future cohorts of great startups are going to increasingly come from outside the continental 48. Dozens of smart, brilliant entrepreneurs aren\u2019t even trying to migrate, instead rightfully seeing their home markets as more open to innovation and technological progress than the vaunted superpower. The frontier is closed here, and it has moved elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>So what are we left with here in the U.S. and increasingly Europe? A narrow-minded policy of blocking external tech innovation to ensure that our sclerotic and entrenched incumbents don\u2019t have to compete with the best in the world. If that isn\u2019t a recipe for economic disaster, I don\u2019t know what is.<\/p>\n<p>But hey: at least the youth will be patriotic.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It used to be \u201ceasy\u201d to tell the American and Chinese economies apart.

subscription monetization to more apps in 2016 \u2014 and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2016\/6\/8\/11880730\/apple-app-store-subscription-update-phil-schiller-interview\">enticed developers with an 85\/15 split<\/a> on revenue from customers that remain subscribed for more than a year \u2014 subscription monetization and retention has felt like the Holy Grail for app developers. So much so that <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/googleplay\/android-developer\/answer\/112622?hl=en\">Google quickly followed suit<\/a>\u00a0in what appeared to be an example of healthy competition for developers in the mobile OS duopoly.<\/p>\n<p>But how does that split actually work out for most apps? Turns out, the 85\/15 split \u2014 which Apple is keen to mention anytime developers complain about the App Store rev share \u2014 doesn\u2019t have a meaningful impact for most developers. Because churn.<\/p>\n<p>No matter how great an app is, subscribers are going to churn. Sometimes it\u2019s because of a credit card expiring or some other billing issue. And sometimes it\u2019s more of a pause, and the user comes back after a few months. But the majority of churn comes from subscribers who, for whatever reason, decide that the app just isn\u2019t worth paying for anymore. If a subscriber churns before the one-year mark, the developer never sees that 85% split. And even if the user resubscribes, Apple and Google reset the clock if a subscription has lapsed for more than 60 days. Rather convenient\u2026 for Apple and Google.<\/p>\n<p>Top mobile apps like Netflix and Spotify report churn rates in the low single digits, but they are the outliers. According to our data, the median churn rate for subscription apps is around\u00a013% for monthly subscriptions\u00a0and around 50% for annual. Monthly subscription churn is generally a bit higher in the first few months, then it tapers off. But an average churn of 13% leaves just 20% of subscribers crossing that magical 85\/15 threshold.<\/p>\n<p>In practice, what this means is that, for all the hype around the 85\/15 split, very few developers are going to see a meaningful increase in revenue:<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2048964\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img

id=\"speakable-summary\">Europe will propose its own digital tax early next year if there&#8217;s no agreement at a global level on how to update taxation rules for the internet age, EU president Ursula von der Leyen <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/speech_20_1655\">said today<\/a>, reiterating the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/18\/eu-digs-in-on-digital-tax-plan-after-us-quits-talks\/\">bloc&#8217;s determination not to let tax reform slide<\/a> in a &#8220;state of the union&#8221; speech to the European Parliament.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We will spare no effort to reach agreement in the framework of OECD and G20. But let there be no doubt: should an agreement fall short of a fair tax system that provides long-term sustainable revenues, Europe will come forward with a proposal early next year,&#8221; she told MEPs.<\/p>\n<p>In the wide-ranging speech &#8212; which also called for the 2020s to be Europe&#8217;s &#8220;digital decade&#8221; &#8212; von der Leyen committed the bloc to spending a fifth (\u20ac150 billion) of the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/27\/5g-ai-cybersecurity-and-renewable-energy-set-for-investment-boost-under-eu-coronavirus-recovery-plan\/\">\u20ac750 billion coronavirus support fund<\/a> announced earlier this year on digital investments.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There has never been a better time to invest in European tech companies with new digital hubs growing everywhere from Sofia to Lisbon to Katowice,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We have the people, the ideas and the strength as a Union to succeed. And this is why we will invest 20% of NextGenerationEU on digital.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are reaching the limits of the things we can do in an analogue way. And this great acceleration is just beginning. We must make this Europe&#8217;s Digital Decade,&#8221; von der Leyen added.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We need a common plan for digital Europe with clearly defined goals for 2030, such as for connectivity, skills and digital public services. And we need to follow clear principles: the right to privacy and connectivity, freedom of speech, free flow of data and cybersecurity.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;But Europe must now lead the way on digital &#8212; or it will have to follow the way of others, who are setting these standards for us. This is why we must move fast.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Beneath the rousing &#8220;digital sovereignty&#8221; rhetoric, the speech didn&#8217;t offer much new on the tech policy front &#8212; but the EU president confirmed that updates to Europe&#8217;s competition rules and regulation on the use of AI are coming next year.<\/p>\n<p>The Commission is <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/02\/europe-asks-for-views-on-platform-governance-and-competition-tools\/\">currently consulting<\/a> on whether a new competition tool is needed to respond to digital network effects that can lead to tipping markets, as well as more widely around a forthcoming Digital Services Act (which didn&#8217;t get any direct mentions in the speech).<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;On personalized data &#8212; business to consumer &#8212; Europe has been too slow and is now dependent on others,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This cannot happen with industrial data. And here the good news is that Europe is in the lead &#8212; we have the technology, and crucially we have the industry.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We presented our new industry strategy in March to ensure industry could lead the twin green and digital transition. The last six months have only accelerated that transformation &#8212; at a time when the global competitive landscape is fundamentally changing. This is why we will update our industry strategy in the first half of next year and adapt our competition framework which should also keep pace,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<h2>Tech investment priorities<\/h2>\n<p>Priorities for digital investment she highlighted are the plan to build a European cloud &#8212; which will be based on the GaiaX federated data infrastructure that&#8217;s developing common requirements for pan-EU data sharing. (This is part of a major Commission push around industrial data reuse, announced <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/19\/europe-sets-out-plan-to-boost-data-reuse-and-regulate-high-risk-ais\/\">earlier this year<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>The second area of investment focus named was artificial intelligence &#8212; with the EU president citing the tech&#8217;s potential to deliver innovations such as &#8220;precision farming in agriculture, more accurate medical diagnosis and safe autonomous driving.&#8221; However, she also emphasized the importance of having rules in place to wrap around the tech, reiterating EU lawmakers&#8217; conviction that a framework is needed to ensure what they dub &#8220;human-centric&#8221; AI.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier this year the EU put out a white paper &#8212; setting out <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/19\/europe-sets-out-plan-to-boost-data-reuse-and-regulate-high-risk-ais\/\">proposals<\/a> for regulating &#8220;high risk&#8221; applications of artificial intelligence, though the final shape of the proposal will have to wait for 2021.<\/p>\n<p>Von der Leyen also suggested lawmakers are looking for ways to give consumers more control over how their data is used in the big data-powered AI era.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We want a set of rules that puts people at the centre. Algorithms must not be a black box and there must be clear rules if something goes wrong. The Commission will propose a law to this effect next year,&#8221; she said today.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This includes control over our personal data which [we] still have far too rarely today. Every time an App or website asks us to create a new digital identity or to easily log on via a big platform, we have no idea what happens to our data in reality.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>To this end, she said the Commission wants to develop &#8220;a secure European e-identity&#8221; that EU citizens could use anywhere in the bloc &#8212; &#8220;to do anything from paying your taxes to renting a bicycle.&#8221; It would be &#8220;a technology where we can control ourselves what data and how data is used,&#8221; she added, riffing on her <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/07\/tech-driven-change-a-key-priority-for-new-ec-president\/\">digital sovereignty theme<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The Commission is reviewing <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/digital-single-market\/en\/trust-services-and-eid\">existing regulations around eID<\/a>, including running a consultation that&#8217;s due to end next month &#8212; where it says it&#8217;s looking at barriers to uptake of eID and trusted services, and considering how to evolve the framework towards an &#8220;EU digital identity.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It now sounds like lawmakers have concrete plans to overhaul eID &#8212; with the aim of promoting a proprietary digital authentication mechanism that can help drive the wider strategy around digitization and data reuse.<\/p>\n<p>The third focus for &#8220;COVID-19 relief&#8221; digital spending is infrastructure, with a push planned around broadband access.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The investment boost through NextGenerationEU is a unique chance to drive [broadband] expansion to every village. This is why we want to focus our investments on secure connectivity, on the expansion of 5G, 6G and fiber,&#8221; said von der Leyen, adding: &#8220;NextGenerationEU is also a unique opportunity to develop a more coherent European approach to connectivity and digital infrastructure deployment.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Her speech also highlighted a planned \u20ac8 billion investment in developing next-gen supercomputers, and reiterated calls for European industry to develop its own next-generation chips &#8212; &#8220;that will allow us to use the increasing data volumes energy-efficient and securely.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;None of this is an end in itself &#8212; it is about Europe&#8217;s digital sovereignty, on a small and large scale,&#8221; she added.<\/p>\n<h2>Green Deal<\/h2>\n<p>Von der Leyen also spent a fair amount of time on the environment and the risks attached to climate change.<\/p>\n<p>The EU president revealed that the Commission is proposing to increase the 2030 target for emissions reduction from 40% to 55%.<\/p>\n<p>The European Green Deal is set to account for a larger chunk of COVID-19 relief spending than digital projects &#8212; although there could, presumably, be some overlap, with von der Leyen talking about &#8220;a world where we use digital technologies to build a healthier, greener society.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>She said 37% (\u20ac277 billion) of the NextGenerationEU fund is to be spent directly on Green Deal objectives.<\/p>\n<p>This spending looks set to give a major boost to electric cars via investment in charging infrastructure. Other areas of focus she mentioned are hydrogen replacing coal for industrial production, and adapting the construction industry to make it more sustainable and less polluting, including by the use of AI and smart technologies.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;NextGenerationEU should invest in lighthouse European projects with the biggest impact: hydrogen, renovation and 1 million electric charging points,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I want NextGenerationEU to create new European Hydrogen Valleys to modernise our industries, power our vehicles and bring new life to rural areas.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our buildings generate 40% of our emissions. They need to become less wasteful, less expensive and more sustainable,&#8221; she added. &#8220;And we know that the construction sector can even be turned from a carbon source into a carbon sink, if organic building materials like wood and smart technologies like AI are applied.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The systemic change needed to support a wholesale shift to a circular economy was dubbed &#8220;a new cultural project for Europe.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Every movement has its own look and feel. And we need to give our systemic change its own distinct aesthetic &#8212; to match style with sustainability,&#8221; she said, announcing a plan to set up &#8220;a new European Bauhaus&#8221; &#8212; aka &#8220;a co-creation space where architects, artists, students, engineers, designers work together to make that happen.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Europe will propose its own digital tax early next year if there&#8217;s no agreement at a global level on how to update taxation rules for the internet age, EU president Ursula von der Leyen said today, reiterating the bloc&#8217;s determination not to let tax reform slide in a &#8220;state of the union&#8221; speech to the [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":39990176,"featured_media":1929835,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","carmot_uuid":"4a577b4a-cea1-3eaa-8d6e-ad9f056eb1c1"},"categories":[424613844,24405894,449557100,13217],"tags":[12374,1232,69816,576734528,576740177,576807157,2702,576644135,576807158,576807159],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/GettyImages-1189431561.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/33zDN2z","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"featured":false,"subtitle":"","fundingRound":false,"seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","premiumContent":false,"premiumCutoffPercent":1,"tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[39990176],"hideFeaturedImage":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2047256"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2047256"}],"version-history":[{"count":32,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2047256\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2047702,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2047256\/revisions\/2047702"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/39990176"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2047256&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/39990176"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1929835"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2047256"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2047256"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2047256"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2047256"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2047256"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2047256"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2047256"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":39990176,"name":"Natasha Lomas","url":"","description":"","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/natasha-lomas\/","slug":"natasha-lomas","avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/68a02f90ad0a6349a7b852ddce6f93e4?s=24&d=identicon&r=g","48":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/68a02f90ad0a6349a7b852ddce6f93e4?s=48&d=identicon&r=g","96":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/68a02f90ad0a6349a7b852ddce6f93e4?s=96&d=identicon&r=g"},"links":{"twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/riptari","linkedin":"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/nlomas","crunchbase":"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/natasha-lomas"},"position":"Writer","cbDescription":"<p>Natasha is a senior reporter for TechCrunch, joining September 2012, based in Europe.

target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kahoot<\/a> originally made its name with a platform that lets educators and students create and share game-based online learning lessons, in the process building up a huge public catalogue of gamified lessons created by its community. Today the startup &#8212; now valued at more than $2 billion &#8212; is announcing an <a href=\"https:\/\/kahoot.com\/press\/2020\/09\/16\/kahoot-actimo-join-forces-strengthen-corporate-learning-culture-engagement\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">acquisition<\/a> to give a boost to another segment of its business: corporate customers.<\/p>\n<p>Kahoot has acquired Danish startup <a href=\"http:\/\/actimo.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Actimo<\/a>, which provides a platform for businesses to train and engage with employees. Kahoot said that the purchase is being made with a combination of cash and shares, and works out to a total enterprise value of between $26 million and $33 million for the smaller company, with the sale expected to be completed in October 2020.<\/p>\n<p>It may sound like a modest sum in a tech market where companies are currently and regularly seeing paper valuations in the hundreds of millions at Series A stage, but it also presents a different kind of trajectory both for founders and their investors.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>This is actually a strong exit for <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/actimo\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"actimo\">Actimo, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> which had raised less than $500,000, according to data from <a href=\"https:\/\/my.pitchbook.com\/profile\/60041-08\/company\/profile#comparisons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PitchBook<\/a>. And it puts Actimo under the wing of a company that has been scaling globally fast, finding &#8212; like others in the areas of online education and remote working &#8212; that the current state of social distancing due to COVID-19 is resulting in a boost to its business.<\/p>\n<p>To give you an idea of the scale and growth of Kahoot, the company says that currently it has over 1 billion &#8220;participating players,&#8221; on top of some 4.4 billion users in aggregate since first launching the platform in 2013. In the last 12 months, some 200 million games have been played on its platform. In June, when Kahoot announced that it had <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/11\/kahoot-raises-28m-for-its-user-generated-educational-gaming-platform-now-valued-at-1-4b\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">raised $28 million<\/a> in funding, it told us that 100 million games had been played.<\/p>\n<p>In light of its growth and the future opportunity &#8212; even putting aside the progression of the coronavirus, it looks like remote work and remote learning will at least become a lot more common as a longer-term option &#8212; the company has also seen a rise in its valuation. With some of its shares traded on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oslobors.no\/ob_eng\/Oslo-Boers\/Listing\/Shares-equity-certificates-and-rights-to-shares\/Merkur-Market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Merkur Market<\/a> in Norway, the company currently has a market cap of 18.716 billion Norwegian Krone, which at today&#8217;s rates is about $2.08 billion. That figure was $1.4 billion in June.<\/p>\n<p>Kahoot&#8217;s targeting of the corporate sector is not new. The company has been building a business in this space for years. It says that in the last 12 months, it logged 2 million sessions across 20 million participating &#8220;players&#8221; of its corporate training &#8220;games,&#8221; with some 97% of the Fortune 500 among those users. Customers include the likes of Facebook (for sales training), Oyo (hospitality training and onboarding) and Qualys (for taking polls during a conference), among others.<\/p>\n<p>Critically, while a lot of Kahoot&#8217;s audience is in education, it&#8217;s corporate that most of the revenues come in &#8212;\u00a0 one reason why it&#8217;s keen to grow that segment with more services and users.<\/p>\n<p>The aim with Actimo, Kahoot says, is to build out a product set aimed at helping organisations with company culture &#8212; which, with many organisations now going on eight months and counting of entire teams working regularly outside of their physical offices, has grown as a priority.<\/p>\n<p>Keeping a team feeling like a team, and an individual feeling more than a transactional regard for an employer, is not a simple thing in the best of times. Now, as we continue to work physically away from each other, it will take even more tools and efforts to get the balance right.<\/p>\n<p>In that context, Actimo&#8217;s solution is just one aspect, but potentially an interesting one: it has built a platform where employees can track the training that they have done or need to do, engage with other co-workers, and provide feedback, and employers can use it to generally track and encourage how employees are engaging across the company and its various efforts. It counts some 200 enterprises, including Circle K, Hi3G and Compass Group, among its customers, and has current ARR of $5 million.<\/p>\n<p>For comparison, Kahoot, in its <a href=\"https:\/\/kahoot.com\/investor\/announcements\/kahoot-as-reports-second-quarter-2020-results\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Q2 financials<\/a> published in August, reported ARR of $25 million, with invoiced revenue for the quarter at $9.6 million, growing some 317% on the same quarter a year before. The company has also raised some $110 million in private funding from the likes of Microsoft and Disney.<\/p>\n<p>As Kahoot looks to find more than just a transient place in a company&#8217;s IT and software fabric &#8212; transience of attention always being a risk with anything gaming-based &#8212; it makes a lot of sense to pick up Actimo and work on ways of coupling the platform with its other corporate work. You can also imagine a time when it might create a similar kind of dashboard for the educational sector.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are excited to welcome the Actimo team to be part of the fast-growing Kahoot! family,\u201d said Kahoot CEO, Eilert Hanoa, in a statement. \u201cThis acquisition will further extend Kahoot!\u2019s corporate learning offerings, by providing solutions tailored for the frontline segment, as well as to solidify company culture and engagement among remote and distributed teams in companies of all types and sizes. This continues our expressed ambition to also grow through M&amp;A by adding strategic capabilities that we can leverage across our global platform.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are thrilled to join forces with Kahoot! in our mission to develop next-level solutions that connect remote employees and boost employee engagement and productivity,\u201d said Eske Gunge, CEO at Actimo, in a statement. \u201cBeing part of Kahoot! and with our experience from working with innovative and ambitious enterprises across industries, we can together set a new standard for corporate learning and engagement.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Norwegian company Kahoot originally made its name with a platform that lets educators and students create and share game-based online learning lessons, in the process building up a huge public catalogue of gamified lessons created by its community.

It had just started to slowly expand its team in the country and was inking deals with telecom operators to make access to its service free to users and even <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2012\/10\/17\/from-zero-to-talktime-hero-facebook-tests-a-new-way-to-sign-up-users-in-india-offering-1-mobile-voice-credits\/\">offer incentives such as free voice credit<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>India\u2019s internet population, now the second largest with more than 500 million connected users, itself was very small. In early 2011, the country had fewer than 100 million internet users.<\/p>\n<p>But <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/facebook\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"facebook\">Facebook <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> ended up playing a crucial role in the last decade. So much so that by the end of it, the social juggernaut was reaching nearly every internet user in the country. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/whatsapp\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"whatsapp\">WhatsApp <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> alone reaches more than 400 million internet users in India, more than any other app in the country, according to mobile insight firm App Annie.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>This reach of Facebook in India didn\u2019t go unnoticed. Politicians in the country today heavily rely on Facebook services, including WhatsApp, to get their message out. But it has also complicated things.<\/p>\n<p>Rumors have spread on WhatsApp that cost lives, and politicians from both the large political parties in India in recent weeks have accused the company of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/01\/indias-it-minister-accuses-facebook-of-suppressing-right-leaning-pages\/\">showing favoritism to the other side<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>To address these issues, and the role Facebook wishes to play in India, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/ajit-mohan\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"ajit-mohan\">Ajit Mohan, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> the head of the company\u2019s business in the country, joined us at Disrupt 2020. Following are some of the highlights.<\/p>\n<h2>On controversy<\/h2>\n<p>A recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/facebook-hate-speech-india-politics-muslim-hindu-modi-zuckerberg-11597423346\">report in WSJ<\/a> claimed that Ankhi Das, one of Facebook\u2019s top executives in India, decided against taking down a post from a politician from the ruling party. She did so, the report claimed, because she feared it could hurt the company\u2019s business prospects in India.<\/p>\n<p>In Mohan\u2019s first interview since the controversy broke, he refuted the claims that any executive in the country holds power to influence how Facebook enforces its content policy.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe believe that it&#8217;s important for us to be open and neutral and non-partisan,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have deep belief and conviction that our enabling role is as a neutral party that allows speech of all kinds, that allows expression of all kinds, including political expression, and a lot of the guidelines that we have developed are to make sure that we really enable our diversity of expression and opinion so long as we&#8217;re able to make sure that the safety and security of people are protected.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Mohan said the internal processes and systems inside Facebook are designed to ensure that any opinion and preference of an employee or a group of employees is \u201cquite separate from the company and the company\u2019s objective enforcement of its own policies.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He said individuals can offer input on decisions, but nobody &#8212; including Ankhi Das &#8212; can unilaterally influence the decision Facebook takes on content enforcement.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe do allow free expression inside the company as well. We don\u2019t have any constraints on people expressing their point of view, but we see that separate from the enforcement of our content policy. [&#8230;] The content policy itself, in the context of India, is a team that stands separate from the public policy team that is led by Ankhi,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2047229\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2047229\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2047229\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/GettyImages-995049800.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"671\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/GettyImages-995049800.jpg 3500w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/GettyImages-995049800.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/GettyImages-995049800.jpg?resize=300,196 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/GettyImages-995049800.jpg?resize=768,503 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/GettyImages-995049800.jpg?resize=680,445 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/GettyImages-995049800.jpg?resize=1536,1006 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/GettyImages-995049800.jpg?resize=2048,1341 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/GettyImages-995049800.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2047229\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">This photo illustration shows an Indian newspaper vendor reading a newspaper with a full back page advertisement from WhatsApp intended to counter fake information, in New Delhi on July 10, 2018. (Photo by Prakash SINGH \/ AFP)<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<h2>On India and monetization<\/h2>\n<p>Even as Facebook has amassed hundreds of millions of users in India, the world\u2019s second largest market contributes little to its bottom line. So why does Facebook care so much about the country?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIndia is in the middle of a very exciting economic and social transformation where digital has a massive role to play. In just the last four years, more than 500 million users have come online. The pace of this transformation probably has no parallel in either human history or even in the digital transformation happening in countries around the world,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor a company like ours, if you look at the family of apps across WhatsApp and Instagram, we believe we have a useful role to play in fueling this transformation,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Even as Facebook does not generate a lot of revenue from India, Mohan said the company has established itself as one of the most trusted platforms for marketers. \u201cThey look to us as a material partner in their marketing agenda,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>He said the company is hopeful that advertising as a GDP will go up in India. \u201cTherefore ad-revenue will become substantial over time,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>For Facebook, India is also crucial because it allows the company to build some unique products that solve issues for India but could be replicated in other markets. The company is currently testing <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/26\/reliance-and-facebook-pilot-jiomart-orders-on-whatsapp\/\">an integration of WhatsApp<\/a>, which currently does not have a business model despite having <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/12\/whatsapp-hits-2-billion-users-up-from-1-5-billion-2-years-ago\/\">over 2 billion users<\/a>, with <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/23\/jiomart-the-e-commerce-venture-by-indias-richest-man-launches-in-additional-cities\/\">new Indian e-commerce JioMart<\/a>, to allow users to easily track their orders.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe think there is opportunity to build India-first models, experiment at scale, and in a world where we succeed, we see huge opportunity in taking some of these models global,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<h2>Facebook as a VC<\/h2>\n<p>Facebook does not usually invest in startups. But in India, the company has <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/06\/13\/facebook-meesho-first-indian-startup-investment\/\">invested in social-commerce firm Meesho<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/19\/facebook-backs-indian-education-startup-unacademy\/\">online learning platform Unacademy<\/a> &#8212; it even <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/02\/indias-online-learning-platform-unacademy-raises-150-million-at-1-45-billion-valuation\/\">participated in its follow-up round<\/a> &#8212; and it wrote a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/21\/facebook-reliance-jio\/\">$5.7 billion check to Jio Platforms earlier this year<\/a>. So why is Facebook taking this investment route in India?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe wanted to create a program for taking minority investments in early-stage startups to figure out how we could be helpful to startup founders and the ecosystem as a whole. The starting point was backing teams that were building models that in some ways were unique to India and could go global. Since we made an investment in <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/meesho\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"meesho\">Meesho, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> they have made a strong thrust in Indonesia. These are the kind of companies where we feel we can add value as well as we can learn from these startups,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>The partnership with Jio Platforms follows a different rationale. \u201cThe transformation we talked about in India in the last few years, Jio triggered it,\u201d he said. Other than that, Facebook is exploring ways to work with Jio, such as with its partnership with Jio\u2019s venture JioMart. \u201cIt can really fuel the small and medium business that is good for the Indian economy,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Mohan said the company continues to explore more opportunities in Indian startups, especially with those where the teams think Facebook can add value, but he said there is no mandate of any kind that Facebook has to invest in, say dozens of startups in three to four years. \u201cIt\u2019s not a volume play,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>But would these firms, including<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">\u00a0Reliance Industries, which operates Jio Platforms and Reliance Retail, will receive any special access on Facebook&#8217;s services. What if Amazon, BigBasket, Grofers, or Flipkart want to integrate with WhatsApp, too? Mohan said Facebook platform is open for every firm and everyone will receive the same level of access and opportunities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In the interview, Mohan, who ran the Disney-run <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/hotstar\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"hotstar\">Hotstar <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> on-demand streaming service in India, also talked about the growing usage of video in India, the state of WhatsApp Pay\u2019s rollout in the country, what Facebook thinks of India&#8217;s ban on Chinese apps, and much more.

350-person, Long Beach, California-based online fitness platform that immerses cyclists and runners in 3D-generated worlds, just raised a hefty $450 million in funding led by the investment firm KKR in exchange for a minority stake in its business.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/permira\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\"

round, alongside earlier backers Highland Europe, Novator, Causeway Media and True, which is a Europe-based consumer specialist firm.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/zwift\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"zwift\">Zwift <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> has now raised $620 million altogether and is valued at north of $1 billion.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Why such a big round? Right now, the company just makes an app, albeit a popular one.<\/p>\n<p>Since its 2015 founding, 2.5 million people have signed up to enter a world that, as Outside magazine <a href=\"https:\/\/www.outsideonline.com\/2393635\/zwift-virtual-training\">once described it<\/a>, is &#8220;part social-media platform, part personal trainer, part computer game.&#8221; That particular combination makes Zwift&#8217;s app appealing to both recreational riders and pros looking to train no matter the conditions outside.<\/p>\n<p>The company declined to share its active subscriber numbers with us &#8212; Zwift charges $15 per month for its service &#8212; but it seemingly has a loyal base of users. For example, 117,000 of them competed in a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/29\/strap-in-a-virtual-tour-de-france-kicks-off-this-weekend-on-the-online-racing-platform-zwift\/\">virtual version of the Tour de France<\/a> that Zwift hosted in July after it was chosen by the official race organizer of the real tour as its partner on the event.<\/p>\n<p>Which leads us back to this giant round and what it will be used for. Today, in order to use the app, Zwift&#8217;s biking adherents need to buy their own smart trainers, which can cost anywhere from $300 to $700 and are made by brands like Elite and Wahoo. Meanwhile, runners use Zwift&#8217;s app with their own treadmills.<\/p>\n<p>Now, Zwift is jumping headfirst into the hardware business itself. Though a spokesman for the company said it can&#8217;t discuss any particulars &#8212; &#8220;It takes time to develop hardware properly, and COVID has placed increased pressure on production&#8221; &#8212; it is hoping to bring its first product to market &#8220;as soon as possible.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>He added that the hardware will make Zwift a &#8220;more immersive and seamless experience for users.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Either way, the direction isn&#8217;t a surprising one for the company, and we don&#8217;t say that merely because Specialized participated in this round as a strategic backer. Co-founder and CEO Eric Min has told us in the past that the company hoped to produce its own trainers some day.<\/p>\n<p>Given the runaway success of the in-home fitness company Peloton, it wouldn&#8217;t be surprising to see a treadmill follow, or even a different product entirely. Said the Zwift spokesman, &#8220;In the future, it\u2019s possible that we could bring in other disciplines or a more gamified experience.&#8221; (It will have expert advice in this area if it does, given that Zwift just brought aboard Ilkka Paananen, the co-founder and CEO of Finnish gaming company Supercell, as an investor and board member.)<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, the company tells us not to expect the kind of classes that have proven so successful for Peloton, tempting as it may be to draw parallels.<\/p>\n<p>While Zwift prides itself on users&#8217; ability to organize group rides and runs and workouts, classes, says its spokesman, are &#8220;not in the offing.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Zwift, a 350-person, Long Beach, California-based online fitness platform that immerses cyclists and runners in 3D-generated worlds, just raised a hefty $450 million in funding led by the investment firm KKR in exchange for a minority stake in its business.

Sketch<\/a>, the London-based product design and collaboration platform that utilises virtual reality, has raised $3.7 million in funding.<\/p>\n<p>The seed round was led by <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/kindredcapital\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"kindredcapital\">Kindred Capital, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> with participation from Point Nine Capital and previous investor Forward Partners. It brings the total amount raised by Gravity Sketch to $5.4 million. In addition, the startup previously received grant funding from InnovationRCA and the James Dyson Foundation.<\/p>\n<p>Founded in 2014 by Oluwaseyi Sosanya, Daniela Paredes and Daniel Thomas, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/gravity-2\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"gravity-2\">Gravity Sketch <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> wants to change the way physical products are designed, developed and brought to market. It offers 3D design software for cross-disciplinary teams so they can &#8220;create, collaborate, and review&#8221; in a much more frictionless way, including via virtual reality, in which collaboration can take place in 3D and real time. The idea is to help speed up development cycles, especially involving globally distributed and increasingly remote teams.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;Collaboration is increasingly important as time frames are shortened and consumers request products sooner, with more features, and produced more sustainably,&#8221; says Oluwaseyi Sosanya, CEO and co-founder of Gravity Sketch. &#8220;There is also a surge in multinational companies growing globally distributed design and engineering teams, who need to stay connected in order to deliver with the same accuracy they once did being in the same location. Small-to-mid-sized design firms who service large companies must also adopt this approach in order to win business &#8212; they often gain work from international clients that are unable to meet face to face as frequently as their domestic clients, and are also held to extremely high standards of delivery.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In addition to pressure brought about by faster product cycles and remote working, the product design process itself isn&#8217;t always optimum, involving multiple teams with different disciplines and software tools and a jump from 2D to 3D. &#8220;When we talk about designing a physical product, we\u2019re imagining this object in 3D,&#8221; says Sosanya. &#8220;However, for many years we have had to bring out that idea through 2D mediums, or through rough physical models. All physical products start with 2D sketches, which are then painstakingly translated to digital 3D models and then produced through standard manufacturing processes.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>To mitigate this, Gravity Sketch brings the designer into the digital 3D space from the initial sketch phase, which gives them greater control over the initial idea and how it develops. The full design team can then join the same VR space to get a full understanding of the design from the designer\u2019s perspective before investing time and resources.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The designer can more accurately get all stakeholders on the same page at the ideation phase,&#8221; Sosanya explains. &#8220;With VR we can leverage the fact that everyone thinks in 3D and offer a solution that sidesteps the 2D visualisation step which is present in every design process, so users can think in 3D and create in 3D. It&#8217;s sort of like a Zoom meeting in 3D, helping everyone understand the yet to be materialised product from their own vantage point.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/nrgeXJ-wK-Q?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, content created in Gravity Sketch can further the design pipeline, meaning there is no need to create different views of a design or have to create a 3D model in another tool. Gravity Sketch designs can be exported to almost all of the CAD tools on the market with a claimed 100% accuracy.<\/p>\n<p>It seems to be resonating, too, with some of the world\u2019s leading companies, such as Ford, Nissan and Reebok using Gravity Sketch, alongside 60 universities and over 50,000 creative professionals worldwide.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Gravity Sketch says the new funding will enable the company to scale up the platform to become &#8220;entirely hardware-agnostic.&#8221; It currently works with a range of virtual reality hardware, and is in beta for iPad, mobile and desktop.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Gravity Sketch, the London-based product design and collaboration platform that utilises virtual reality, has raised $3.7 million in funding.

Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, at an industry event on Wednesday.<\/p>\n<p>That makes China the largest 5G market in terms of user size, the think tank president said. The milestone came in less than a year after China&#8217;s top carriers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-china-telco-5g\/chinas-state-telecoms-to-launch-5g-services-on-friday-idUSKBN1XA0JC\">rolled out <\/a>\u00a05G plans for consumers, and just over a year after the authority began issuing 5G licenses <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/06\/05\/china-5g-license-is-here\/\">for commercial use<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The number is still a small fraction of the overall subscription. In June, China&#8217;s three state-run carriers collectively commanded <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thepaper.cn\/newsDetail_forward_8367606\">some 1.6 billion mobile subscribers<\/a> (suggesting China&#8217;s 1.4 billion population owned more than one mobile device per capita).<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>China&#8217;s 5G ambition is a multi-pronged effort among the government, network carriers, telecoms equipment makers, device makers and software developers. Policymakers need to show consumers visible improvement on network speed, and as such the carriers have been aggressively setting up 5G base stations across the country &#8212; more than 460,000 towers by July.<\/p>\n<p>China was adding an average of 15,000 new 5G base stations every week, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.scio.gov.cn\/xwfbh\/xwbfbh\/wqfbh\/42311\/43346\/index.htm\">said<\/a> an official in July. The government has plans to raise that number to 600,000 by the end of 2020, covering all prefectural-level cities nationwide. A clear winner in China&#8217;s 5G push is Huawei, which makes both 5G devices and the infrastructure that undergirds the next-gen network.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, Huawei, Oppo, Xiaomi and their rivals are rushing to launch 5G-compatible handsets. China has sold more than 93 million units of 5G mobile phones this year so far, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.caict.ac.cn\/kxyj\/qwfb\/qwsj\/202009\/P020200910562155591896.pdf\">recent data<\/a> released by CAICT. 5G phones accounted for 60% of total shipments in August.<\/p>\n<p>China&#8217;s rapid shift to 5G is also driving the need for new hardware parts like integrated circuits.

According <a href=\"https:\/\/www.un.org\/en\/sections\/issues-depth\/ageing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">to the United Nations<\/a>, the fastest-growing age bracket worldwide is aged 65-years-old and older. At the same time, there is also an acute shortage of caregivers in many countries, complicated by high rates of burnout in the profession.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It\u2019s absolutely one of the most important social topics and global issues,&#8221; Tee said during her Disrupt session (the video is embedded at the bottom of this article).<\/p>\n<p>Founded in Singapore four years ago, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/homage-3\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"homage-3\">Homage&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> platform uses a matchmaking engine to help families find the best caregivers, while its telehealth platform provides services like online medical consultations and screenings. It has since launched in Malaysia and yesterday <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/homage-announces-strategic-partnership-with-infocom-one-of-japans-largest-healthcare-it-providers\/\">announced a new strategic investment from Infocom<\/a>, one of the largest healthcare technology companies in Japan. The partnership will enable Homage to accelerate its Asia-Pacific expansion.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Before starting Homage, Tee was co-founder of New York-based Rocketrip. A ticket-booking platform created to reduce work travel-related costs for companies, Rocketrip attracted investors like Google Ventures, Y Combinator and Bessemer Ventures, and raised more than $30 million. But in 2016, Tee decided to return to Singapore, her home country, after living abroad for about 15 years. In her Disrupt session, Tee said this was to be closer to her mother, and because she felt that her startup experience could also be applied to Southeast Asia.<\/p>\n<p>Tee knew that she wanted to launch another company, but she didn\u2019t decide to tackle the caregiving space immediately. That idea materialized when several of her close relatives were diagnosed with chronic conditions that needed specialized care.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We didn\u2019t know how to cope or how even to start thinking about what was required, and that was when I realized, wow, I needed to get myself schooled in many ways,&#8221; Tee said.<\/p>\n<p>Many families around the world are dealing with the same challenges as their populations age and social dynamics shift. Family members who traditionally would have been carers for relatives are unable to do so because they have moved away or need to work.<\/p>\n<p>Families often rely on word-of-mouth or agencies to find caregivers, a complicated, time-intensive and often emotionally difficult process. Homage uses matching algorithms to make it easier. One of the most unique things about the platform is how much detail it goes into. Providers are not only screened based on their certifications and the kind of care they provide (for example, long-term care, respite care, physical therapy or rehabilitation), but specific skills. For example, many patients need mobility assistance, so Homage assesses what kind of transfers they are able to safely perform.<\/p>\n<p>Then its matching technology decides which caregivers are best suited for a patient, and final assignments are made by Homage&#8217;s staff. By streamlining the process, Homage also lowers its costs, making its services accessible to more people while increasing pay rates for providers.<\/p>\n<p>Better pay taps into another one of Homage&#8217;s goals: expanding the caregiving pool in its markets and retaining talent. Other ways it addresses the issue is by placing caregivers on its platform into the jobs they are best suited for, organizing continuing education programs and making sure they are not over-scheduled. Some caregivers on the platform have long-term contracts, while others work with Homage clients only a few days a week.<\/p>\n<h3>A holistic approach to &#8220;age-tech&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p>In June, Homage <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/03\/singapore-based-caregiving-startup-launches-homage-health-for-online-and-home-medical-consultations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">launched its telehealth service<\/a>. Called Homage Health, the platform has been in development for a while, but its launch was accelerated because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Remote consultations fit into the &#8220;high-touch,&#8221; or in-person, care side of the company\u2019s business because many patients need regular screenings or consultations with doctors and specialists. For patients who have limited mobility or are immunocompromised, this makes it easier for them to make routine consults.<\/p>\n<p>Hardware, including wearable sensors, also show promise to identify potential health issues, like heart conditions, before they require acute care, but one challenge is making them easier for patients to integrate into their daily routines or remember to wear, Tee said.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, Homage\u2019s mission is to create a holistic platform that covers many caregiving needs. Its new partnership with strategic investor Infocom will help bring that forward because the company, which Tee said Homage has been talking to for several years, works with about 13,000 facilities in Japan, including senior residences and hospitals. Infocom develops software for a wide range of verticals, including drug, hospital and medical record management, and medical imaging.<\/p>\n<p>Infocom also runs its own caregiving platform, and its partnership with Homage will enable the two companies to collaborate and reach more patients. Japan has one of the largest populations of elderly people in the world. Tee said at minimum, half a million caregivers need to be mobilized within the next five to 10 years in Japan in order to meet demand.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We need to start building infrastructure to enable people to be able to access the kind of care services that they need, and so we really align in terms of that mission with Infocom,&#8221; said Tee. &#8220;They also have a platform that engages caregivers to apply for jobs in Japan and they see the Homage model as being particularly applicable because it\u2019s curated as well.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f5c0f26ae62e42c37634fc3\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s always a pleasure to chat with Homage co-founder and chief executive Gillian Tee because of her nuanced take on how technology can help elderly and other vulnerable people.

The firm offers &#8220;patient capital&#8221; &#8212; with only a single LP (the Danish family office IPQ Capital) &#8212; and promises to provide portfolio companies with deep healthcare expertise and the extra runway needed to get over regulatory and efficacy hurdles and to the next stage.<\/p>\n<p>Companies already backed by <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/crista-galli-ventures\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"crista-galli-ventures\">Crista Galli Ventures <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> (CGV) include <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/08\/skin-analytics-raises-4m-series-a-to-use-ai-for-skin-cancer-screening\/\">Skin Analytics<\/a>, which is using AI to improve diagnosis of skin cancer; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eu-startups.com\/2020\/07\/valencia-based-quibim-secures-e8-million-to-detect-covid-19-and-other-diseases-early\/\">Quibim<\/a>, which is applying AI to the field of radiomics; and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/ampersand-health-8f60\">Ampersand Health<\/a>, which is developing digital therapies for patients with inflammatory conditions such as Crohn&#8217;s disease, to name just three out of 15.<\/p>\n<p>Led by consultant radiologist Dr. Fiona Pathiraja, and with offices in London and Copenhagen, CGV operates as an &#8220;evergreen&#8221; fund, meaning it doesn&#8217;t follow traditional five-year VC fundraising cycles. Initially, the VC firm has $65 million in deployable &#8212; so called &#8212; patient capital.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;We like to invest across the broad areas of deep tech, digital health and personalised healthcare,&#8221; Pathiraja tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We prefer technology solutions that make the lives of patients easier and better and, in some cases, that help support people&#8217;s health before they become patients. Part of our remit is also for tech solutions within the healthcare industry that improve efficiency and productivity of providers.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Alongside the main fund, CGV is also unveiling Crista Galli LABS, which, in part, aims for greater diversity in health tech by backing founders from underrepresented backgrounds at the pre-seed stage. In addition to pre-seed investment, startups accepted into the program have access to mentoring and coaching from the CGV team.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When I was in hospital, there were people from all backgrounds there and this was the norm&#8230; [but] this really wasn\u2019t my experience when I started investing,&#8221; explains Pathiraja. &#8220;I am struck by how homogeneous both founder teams and investment teams can be. Whilst our core investment focus is seed and Series A, Crista Galli LABS invests smaller ticket sizes in outstanding pre-seed founders and ensures that at least 50% of these are from under-represented backgrounds. This means those who are female, BAME, LGBT to start with.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Crista Galli Ventures, an early-stage health tech fund in Europe, is officially launching today.

He said even though Dropbox is a cloud service, no SaaS tool in his view was purpose-built for this new way of working and we have to reevaluate what work means in this new context.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;Back in March we started thinking about this, and how [the rapid shift to distributed work] just kind of happened. It wasn&#8217;t really designed. What if you did design it? How would you design this experience to be really great? And so starting in March we reoriented our whole product road map around distributed work,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>He also broadly hinted that the fruits of that redesign are coming down the pike. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have a lot more to share about our upcoming launches in the future,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Houston said that his company has adjusted well to working from home, but when they had to shut down the office, he was in the same boat as every other CEO when it came to running his company during a pandemic. Nobody had a blueprint on what to do.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When it first happened, I mean there&#8217;s no playbook for running a company during a global pandemic so you have to start with making sure you&#8217;re taking care of your customers, taking care of your employees, I mean there&#8217;s so many people whose lives have been turned upside down in so many ways,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>But as he checked in on the customers, he saw them asking for new workflows and ways of working, and he recognized there could be an opportunity to design tools to meet these needs.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I mean this transition was about as abrupt and dramatic and unplanned as you can possibly imagine, and being able to kind of shape it and be intentional is a huge opportunity,&#8221; Houston said.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"IHpUkQvOLa\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/21\/why-dropbox-shares-are-soaring-after-it-reported-earnings\/\">Why Dropbox shares are soaring after it reported earnings<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Why Dropbox shares are soaring after it reported earnings&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/21\/why-dropbox-shares-are-soaring-after-it-reported-earnings\/embed\/#?secret=IHpUkQvOLa\" data-secret=\"IHpUkQvOLa\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Houston debuted Dropbox in 2008 at the precursor to TechCrunch Disrupt, then called the TechCrunch 50.

href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/facebook\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"facebook\">Facebook <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Messenger <a href=\"https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/facebook-messenger-forwarding-limit-misinformation-142741554.html\">introduced<\/a> new rules around message forwarding to limit the spread of misinformation on its platform. Speaking today at TechCrunch Disrupt 2020, Facebook Messenger VP Stan Chudnovsky offered more detail about how Facebook views its role in fighting the spread of misinformation and other harmful content across its messaging platform, while still balancing the idea that Messenger is meant to be a platform for private and, at times, encrypted conversations (aka &#8220;secret&#8221; messages).<\/p>\n<p>Chudnovsky explained that Facebook&#8217;s goal is to make Messenger feel like the digital equivalent of having a private conversation between friends and family in the living room. But the company also acknowledged that with the rise of digital tools and new mediums, there are things that Facebook needs to be cognizant of, when it comes to how those tools can be abused.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Messenger is obviously a private means of communicating. And we want to make sure it is private. This is a very important priority for us,&#8221; Chudnovsky started. But when users began forwarding messages at scale, Messenger is then no longer about having a private conversation. It becomes a tool for one-to-many information sharing, he explained.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;This is&#8230;more like a public broadcast,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook had first announced <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/06\/21\/facebook-sri-lanka-myanmar\/\">last year<\/a> that it was &#8220;adding friction&#8221; to message forwarding for Messenger users in Sri Lanka, so people could only share a particular message a certain number of times. The limit was set to five people or groups at the time. Those <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2020\/09\/introducing-a-forwarding-limit-on-messenger\/\">same rules have now expanded<\/a> across the Messenger platform, with the same forwarding limit of five people or groups.<\/p>\n<p>The new limits, the exec continued, aim to stop this spamming behavior. &#8220;Certain pieces of information cannot be forwarded too many times&#8230;that&#8217;s something that we think is really going to help in stopping the spread of the misinformation, especially in the times that we are in right now,&#8221; he added.<\/p>\n<p>Chudnovsky also noted that because of how Messenger is connected to Facebook, when false information gets flagged by Facebook&#8217;s partnered fact checkers, that same warning about the information&#8217;s inaccuracy can then be inserted into any Messenger conversations, to warn users who may have been sent the misleading or otherwise harmful content.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t violate privacy at all because it all comes through the same big pipelines,&#8221; he pointed out.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>Facebook&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/journalismproject\/programs\/third-party-fact-checking\/how-it-works\">website<\/a> that details how its fact-checking program works doesn&#8217;t yet include a mention of Messenger, only Facebook and Instagram.<\/p>\n<p>One thing Facebook won&#8217;t consider is putting an end to link-sharing entirely, Chudnovsky said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I think those things are core to the internet,&#8221; Chudnovsky said of link-sharing and forwarding. &#8220;[Completely banning] the ability for people to exchange information on the internet defeats the purpose of [the] internet itself,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f61246eeef9f92bfbf0a6ed\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A few weeks ago, Facebook Messenger introduced new rules around message forwarding to limit the spread of misinformation on its platform.

before we can be confident that the virus has been contained. It will take even longer for the global economy to recover its footing,\u201d the memo read.<\/p>\n<p>Six months later, Sequoia\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sequoiacap.com\/people\/roelof-botha\/\">Roelof Botha<\/a> is \u201csurprised&#8221; at the state of venture capital and startups in the country, which are largely benefitting from \u2014 not struggling with \u2014 from COVID-19 tailwinds.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>VCs are pouring money at a rapid clip into <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/11\/vcs-pour-funding-into-edtech-startups-as-covid-19-shakes-up-the-market\/\">edtech<\/a>, SaaS, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/27\/covid-19-is-driving-demand-for-low-code-apps\/\">low-code and no code<\/a>, as well as telemedicine. In some cases, investors say venture funding has been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/15\/a-new-silicon-valley-venture-report-shocks-because-of-how-little-the-pandemic-has-impacted-dealmaking\/\">hotter than ever<\/a> ahead of the U.S. elections, beating not just March 2020, but <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/31\/what-pandemic-inside-bostons-scorching-vc-summer\/\">2019 records overall<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Sequoia, it seems, is happy to be wrong. This week, Sequoia Capital will have backed three of the 12 companies going public: Sumo Logic, Unity, and Snowflake. Snowflake is expected to go out at $30 billion valuation, which some say will be the largest U.S. software company to ever go public. Beyond the firm, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/21\/unicorn-rodeo-6-high-flying-startups-that-are-set-to-go-public\/\">numbers of unicorns are gearing up<\/a>, or teasing, to go public in the coming weeks.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI&#8217;m proud of the fact that we saw a few things and anticipated a few things,\u201d he said during TechCrunch Disrupt. \u201cBut we also got many things wrong.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Botha pointed to a few factors that saved startupland from freezing up. First, he said the U.S. government&#8217;s stimulus package helped make sure that there was not a \u201ccomplete economic meltdown.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t quite expect that scale reaction,\u201d Botha said. He\u2019s referring to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/27\/cares-act-stimulus-package-covid-19\/\">the $2 trillion CARES Act<\/a> passed by Congress and signed by President Trump, which included PPP loans designed to provide a direct incentive for small businesses to keep their workers on the payroll. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/06\/heres-a-list-of-tech-companies-that-the-sba-says-took-ppp-money\/\">Tech recipients<\/a> included Bolt Mobility, Getaround, Luminar, Stackin, TuSimple and Velodyne.<\/p>\n<p>Botha addressed how tech companies have helped sustain businesses and operations amid the pandemic, which has trickled down to new customer growth and revenue.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/zoom-video-communications\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"zoom-video-communications\">Zoom, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> a Sequoia portfolio company, might be one of the best examples of how a tech company was <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/01\/zooms-q2-report-details-some-of-the-most-extraordinary-growth-ive-ever-seen\/\">poised to skyrocket<\/a> during the pandemic. According to Botha, the firm, which still owns shares in the company, wishes it had held onto more of its position longer. Sequoia invested in Zoom when it was valued at $1 billion. Today, it is worth more than $100 billion, graduating from an enterprise videoconferencing service to a household consumer product.<\/p>\n<p>To be fair, some of Sequoia&#8217;s warning signs proved true: Layoffs inundated Silicon Valley; companies shuttered citing a drop in revenue; and the market remains volatile.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe also have to realize there&#8217;s a lot of pain and there are many mainstream businesses and local services and restaurants and coffee shops that often suffer economically,\u201d he said. \u201cI don&#8217;t want to be overly sanguine just because technology stocks have had a good run. As a country, we need to brace ourselves for helping everybody.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f61008beef9f92bfbf02240\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In March, famed investment firm Sequoia Capital published the Black Swan Memo, warning founders about the potential business consequences of the coronavirus, which had not yet been labeled a pandemic. \u201cIt will take considerable time \u2014 perhaps several quarters \u2014 before we can be confident that the virus has been contained.

The company is a leader and first mover in synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) technology for microsatellites. It is building and operating its own commercial constellation of SAR microsatellites capable of providing satellite imagery regardless of the cloud cover, weather conditions and time of the day and night (comparable resolution to traditional SAR satellites with 100x lower cost factor), which is disrupting the multibillion dollar satellite imagery market.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don\u2019t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?<\/strong><br \/>\nI would love to see more startups in the digital twin space; technology that enables creation of an exact digital replica\/copy of something in physical space \u2014 a product, process or even the whole ecosystem. This kind of solution enables experiments and [the implementation of] changes that otherwise could be extremely costly or risky \u2013 it can provide immense value added for customers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?<\/strong><br \/>\nA company with unique value proposition to its customers, deep tech component that provides competitive edge over other players in the market and a founder with global vision and focus on execution of that vision.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products\/services are you wary or concerned about?<\/strong><br \/>\nNo market\/sector is too saturated and has no room for innovation. Some markets seem to be more challenging than others due to immense competitive landscape (e.g., food delivery, language-learning apps) but still can be the subject of disruption due to a unique value proposition of a new entrant.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?<\/strong><br \/>\nOTB is focused on opportunities with links to Central Eastern European talent (with no bias toward any hub in the region), meaning companies that leverage local engineering\/entrepreneurial talent in order to build world-class products to compete globally (usually HQ outside CEE).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?<\/strong><br \/>\nCEE region is recognized for its sizable and highly skilled talent pool in the fields of engineering and software development. The region is well-positioned to build up solutions that leverage deep, unique tech regardless of vertical (especially B2B). Historically, the region was especially strong in AI\/ML, voice\/speech\/NLP technologies, cybersecurity, data analytics, etc.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?<\/strong><br \/>\nCEE (including Poland and Warsaw) has always been recognized as an exceptionally strong region in terms of engineering\/IT talent. Inherent risk aversion of entrepreneurs has driven, for a number of years, a more \u201ccopycat\u201d\/local market approach, while holding back more ambitious, deep tech opportunities. In recent years we are witnessing a paradigm shift with a new generation of entrepreneurs tackling problems with unique, deep tech solutions, putting emphasis on global expansion, neglecting shallow local markets. As such, the quality of deals has been steadily growing and currently reflects top quality on global scale, especially on tech level. CEE market demonstrates also a growing number of startups (in total), which is mostly driven by an abundance of early-stage capital and success stories in the region (e.g., DataRobot, Bolt, UiPath) that are successfully evangelizing entrepreneurship among corporates\/engineers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?<\/strong><br \/>\nI believe that local hubs will hold their dominant position in the ecosystem. The remote\/digital workforce will grow in numbers but proximity to capital, human resources and markets still will remain the prevalent force in shaping local startup communities.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?<\/strong><br \/>\nOTB invests in general in companies with clearly defined technological advantage, making quantifiable and near-term difference to their customers (usually in the B2B sector), which is a value-add regardless of the market cycle. The economic downturn works generally in favor of technological solutions enabling enterprise clients to increase efficiency, cut costs, bring optimization and replace manual labour with automation \u2014 and the vast majority of OTB portfolio fits that description. As such, the majority of the OTB portfolio has not been heavily impacted by the COVID pandemic.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?<\/strong><br \/>\nThe COVID pandemic has not impacted our investment strategy in any way. OTB still pursues unique tech opportunities that can provide its customers with immediate value added. This kind of approach provides a relatively high level of resilience against economic downturns (obviously, sales cycles are extending but in general sales pipeline\/prospects\/retention remains intact). Liquidity in portfolio is always the number one concern in uncertain, challenging times. Lean approach needs to be reintroduced, companies need to preserve cash and keep optimizing \u2014 that\u2019s the only way to get through the crisis.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Are you seeing \u201cgreen shoots\u201d regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?<\/strong><br \/>\nA good example in our portfolio is Segron, a provider of an automated testing platform for applications, databases and enterprise network infrastructure. Software development, deployment and maintenance in enterprise IT ecosystem requires continuous and rigorous testing protocols and as such a lot of manual heavy lifting with highly skilled engineering talent being involved (which can be used in a more productive way elsewhere). The COVID pandemic has kept engineers home (with no ability for remote testing) while driving demand for digital services (and as such demand for a reliable IT ecosystem). The Segron automated framework enables full automation of enterprise testing leading to increased efficiency, cutting operating costs and giving enterprise customers peace of mind and a good night&#8217;s sleep regarding their IT infrastructure in the challenging economic environment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so?

selling sustainable aviation fuel, the company is already preparing for two more.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/lanzatech-new-zealand\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"lanzatech-new-zealand\">LanzaTech <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> CEO Jennifer Holmgren said Tuesday on the Disrupt 2020 virtual stage that the carbon capture technology company is planning to use its core technology to create two other businesses.<\/p>\n<p>LanzaTech captures waste gas emissions and uses bacteria to turn it into useable ethanol fuel. A bioreactor is used to convert into liquids captured and compressed waste emissions from a steel mill or factory or any other emissions-producing enterprises.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The core technology of LanzaTech \u2014 and its future businesses \u2014 is a bacteria that likes to eat these dirty gas streams. As the bacteria eats the emissions it essentially ferments them \u2014 a bit like how beer is made, Holmgren recently explained \u2014 and emits ethanol. The ethanol can then be turned into various products.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Using a technology like ours that can use so many different feedstocks \u2014 waste biomass, industrial gases, CO2 from the air \u2014 you&#8217;re going to be making so much ethanol, that I think of ethanol as the feedstock of the future. In other words, you&#8217;re going to use ethanol to make other products.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In June, LanzaTech did just that and announced a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/02\/lanzajet-launches-to-make-renewable-jet-fuel-a-reality\/\">spin-off called LanzaJet<\/a>. The new company launched with commitments from Japanese trading and investment company Mitsui &amp; Co. and Canadian oil and gas producer Suncor Energy, which will invest $85 million to fund pilot and development-scale facilities for LanzaJet.<\/p>\n<p>Now it seems that LanzaTech has plans to pursue other pieces of the supply chain. Holmgren said the company is focused on a couple of use cases on the chemical side. Ethanol, for instance, can be converted to ethylene, which is used to make polyethylene for bottles and PEP for fibers used to make clothes.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We see a path from ethanol to products using today&#8217;s supply chain,&#8221; Holmgren said.<\/p>\n<p>More importantly, LanzaTech has focused on synthetic biology. The company has learned to modify the bacteria that it already uses to make ethanol, and instead harnesses it to make other chemicals directly.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;So you can imagine someday, we&#8217;re not just gonna make a fuel for a plane, we&#8217;re going make the seatbelts and upholstery \u2014 all of these things through synthetic biology,&#8221; she said, adding that this will likely become a spin-off.<\/p>\n<p>The second spin-off company focuses on a byproduct it already makes. The bacteria that eats carbon monoxide, hydrogen and carbon dioxide is a &#8220;skinny bacteria&#8221; as Holmgren calls it, because it is mostly protein. LanzaTech already sells this skinny bacteria as a co-product of its technology.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Not in the too distant future we will want to run a reactor with all of these gases, not to make ethanol, but to make protein, and I see that as an ultimate spin-out as well,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>Holmgren didn&#8217;t provide a specific timeline of these spin-outs. Although she added that the company is putting together a plan now and will begin to make some moves in the next three months. There is capital that will be needed to get these enterprises up and running. The synthetic biology spin-off, which Holmgren said is further along, will need a couple hundred million dollars up front.<\/p>\n<p>Holmgren also announced Tuesday during Disrupt 2020 a new <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/15\/lanzatech-is-developing-a-small-scale-waste-biomass-gasifier-for-ethanol-production-in-india\/\">small-scale waste biomass gasifier in India<\/a>. The new gasifier will be hosted at Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemical, one of India\u2019s largest refiners. The LanzaTech gasifier, which will be built in partnership with Indian project development firm Ankur Scientific, will use waste to make ethanol and chemicals rather than power.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f60ef29d7e1933299669ca7\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Just three months after LanzaTech announced a spin-out aimed at selling sustainable aviation fuel, the company is already preparing for two more.

Health updates its healthcare career platform to help nurse hiring cope with COVID"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">The healthcare industry, even prior to the current pandemic, has never looked much like other industries when it comes to hiring and career management. That was the impetus behind <a href=\"https:\/\/www.incrediblehealth.com\">Incredible Health<\/a>, a startup founded by medical doctor Iman Abuzeid and Amazon alum Rome Portlock. The platform <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/incredible-health\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"incredible-health\">Incredible Health <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> built is all about connecting nurses with jobs &#8212; but it goes above and beyond your typical online job board in order to provide better service both to job seekers and hospitals, and to help nurses throughout the course of their careers.<\/p>\n<p>I spoke to Abuzeid, who serves as Incredible Health&#8217;s CEO, about some new features that Incredible Health has just introduced, in part to address the particular needs of nurses and hospitals considering the constraints of COVID-19 and the ongoing challenges it presents. She first explained why Incredible is a unique platform to begin with, among a sea of relatively undifferentiated job search products.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There are three unique things about the platform,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The first is that the employers apply to the nurses instead of the other way around &#8212; which we can do because of this huge supply-demand imbalance. The second is that we&#8217;ve automated the screening and pre-vetting of the nurses, so we&#8217;re able to automatically verify things like licenses and certifications, and experiences and so on, because we&#8217;ve integrated with so many databases. And the third thing we do is custom matching algorithms.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>That means Incredible Health provides hospitals with only matches that meet their exact needs for a specific position requirement, rather than forcing them to wade through large numbers of potential applicants who might not have the skills they need. In a field like nursing, which has a lot of specific professional designations and certifications, specificity actually helps both sides quite a bit.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The end result of all of that is hires that happen at least three or four times faster,&#8221; Abuzeid told me. &#8220;Our average right now is 13 days, and the efficiency is about 30 times more efficient than a standard job board. Really, some of the biggest impacts we have are financial &#8212; we save on average, each hospital we work with, about $2 million per year. We do that by reducing their travel nurse budget, because they don&#8217;t have to use as many contract workers when they&#8217;re permanently staffed. And we also reduce their overtime costs, and their HR costs.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Abuzeid also told me that nurses hired through Incredible Health tend to stick around longer. The startup only has about a year of historical data to check against so far, but she said that so far, they&#8217;re seeing about 25% higher retention versus the industry average. She added that they suspect this is due largely to the fact that nurses are able to consider multiple offers and hospital options on the platform, since there are often multiple employers vying to hire the same employee, especially in the case of specialization like ICU nurses.<\/p>\n<p>As for what&#8217;s new to Incredible Health, the company has introduced automated interview scheduling. Abuzeid says that has led to 70% of interviews being scheduled via automation within 36 hours on the platform currently. The platform has also introduced remote interviewing for safely distanced pre-hiring interactions, and in-app chat between potential employers and nurses right in the iOS, Android and web apps that Incredible Health offers. Profiles for nurses on the platform also now list specialties and skills, from a pre-set catalog of 45 specialties and 250 skills that are specific to the nursing field, like ICU or OR expertise. Abuzeid said that most of these were fast-tracked due to significant changes they were seeing in the hiring process as a result of the COVID pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We saw several impacts,&#8221; she told me. &#8220;First is like the number of offers that started to go out &#8212; we see one go out every few hours now. And the number of interview requests is up to one being sent every few minutes. So it&#8217;s really accelerated, and that&#8217;s been a combination of two things. One is just that we made the software better and more efficient &#8212; but the other thing is the urgency also increased on the hospital end, given the pandemic.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Aside from improving the process of hiring versus traditional methods, and supporting more remote hiring and onboarding workflows, Incredible Health also addresses some of the diversity gaps in the current healthcare industry hiring process. Abuzeid explained that that&#8217;s due in part to built-in features of the platform like salary estimate calculators, and adds that some tweaks have been created intentionally to level the playing field.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Thirty percent of nurses in the U.S. identify as minorities, so we take diversity pretty seriously because that&#8217;s a huge chunk of our user base,&#8221; she said. &#8220;By giving nurses salary data, it democratizes that and makes you more informed. We also provide talent advocates who are also nurses on our team that support every single nurse, helping them almost as career coach to support them throughout the hiring process.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Incredible Health also takes steps to ensure the product isn&#8217;t itself reinforcing any existing biases that may be present, consciously or otherwise, on the part of hiring parties.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We random sort the list of nurses as they&#8217;re displayed in front of employers and the application, or we use avatars instead of profile pictures. We&#8217;re also constantly monitoring the data that&#8217;s in the platform. So for example, we noticed that recruiters were biasing against nurses that lived farther away. And so we just removed the current location of the nurse, we just stopped displaying that, and that bias went away. So it&#8217;s really important that the software and our algorithms actually counter human bias.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So far, Incredible Health has raised $17 million in funding, including a Series A last year led by <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/jeff-jordan\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"jeff-jordan\">Jeff Jordan <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> at Andreessen Horowitz. The company is already in use at more than 200 hospitals across the U.S., as well as at a number of the largest healthcare networks in the country, like HCA and Baylor, and at academic medical centres, including Cedar Sinai and Stanford. The startup is growing quickly by addressing a long-standing need with software designed specifically to the challenge, and looks poised for even more future growth as the demand for qualified, well-supported healthcare professionals grows.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The healthcare industry, even prior to the current pandemic, has never looked much like other industries when it comes to hiring and career management.

class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> he says that he and Pall were impressed by LoanSnap&#8217;s promise to process loans more efficiently than other lenders. By getting involved in the company, all sides also recognized a &#8220;massive press opportunity for LoanSnap at a time when COVID was hitting and there was going to be billions of dollars in refinancing going on that [the company] wanted to participate in,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, despite investing a relatively small amount &#8212; $250,000 &#8212; in what was ultimately a $10 million round for LoanSnap in May, Mantis was credited in numerous reports as being the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.builtinsf.com\/2020\/05\/15\/loansnap-raises-10m-chainsmokers-mantis-vc-fund\">deal lead<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Taggart and Pall say they also take inspiration from singer Jimmy Buffett, who has co-created numerous businesses to both benefit, and capitalize off, his own fan base. Though Buffett started with Margaritaville &#8212; a hospitality company with a casual dining American restaurant chain, a chain of stores selling Jimmy Buffett-themed merchandise and casinos with lodging facilities &#8212; he has more recently begun building <a href=\"https:\/\/www.latitudemargaritaville.com\/\">retirement communities<\/a> in Florida for aging Buffett acolytes, and Pall and Taggart say the strategy resonates.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When we started eight years ago, our fans were primarily all in college,&#8221; says Taggart. &#8220;Now they are dealing with paying back their college loans, and they&#8217;re probably applying to buy their first house, so a company like LoanSnap feels like one of those startups whose services our fans have grown into needing.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Pall and Taggart aren&#8217;t entirely brand new to investing. Pall says they&#8217;ve been making seed-stage bets as angel investors for several years, including in <a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" href=\"https:\/\/ember.com\/\">Ember<\/a>, an eight-year-old, LA-based company that makes temperature-controlled mugs and travel mugs and has raised roughly $25 million altogether, shows Crunchbase.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to say that we were like thinking in this incredible way about the business at the time, but we were just like, &#8216;This is a really great product and we love the founder,&#8217; &#8221; Pall says.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, the two got into a number of &#8220;diverse deals,&#8221; he continues, but &#8220;all of it was inbound&#8221; until two years ago, when they &#8220;decided to kind of change our strategy and go seek out the opportunities that we thought were out there&#8230;\u00a0 We thought that maybe if we institutionalize this process, [we&#8217;ll discover] a lot more opportunity out there for us to work with dynamic founders and interesting founders who are going to change the landscape of tomorrow.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Soon after, Pall and Taggart were introduced to Koch and Evans, who had already joined forces and were looking for an investment partner who was a market influencer. The group spent the next year getting to know one another, and things began coming together from there.<\/p>\n<p>Pall and Taggart &#8212; who say that all four members of the team have to want to do a deal for it to move forward &#8212; are certainly entrepreneurial themselves. Aside from performing roughly 100 shows last year before beginning work this year on a fourth album, the two also run a production studio. And they are stakeholders in a small-batch spirit brand called JaJa Tequila.<\/p>\n<p>Last year, they also co-founded <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yellowheart.io\/\">YellowHeart<\/a>, a ticketing platform that aims to put more power in the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/18\/yellowheart\/\">hands of performers<\/a>, rather than scalpers.<\/p>\n<p>Mantis was<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-05-14\/chainsmokers-band-plans-to-invest-50-million-in-startups\"> originally targeting $50 million<\/a> in capital commitments, as reported by Bloomberg. Asked if that target proved too ambitious, Koch says the original idea was to raise $30 million, and that though the fund&#8217;s limited partner agreement stated that it could raise up to $50 million, the team &#8220;just decided that for a first-time fund, in order for us to produce a great IRR, we&#8217;d just rather stick to the target.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>You can find our interview with Taggart and Pall at the 21-minute mark.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_1\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f612c7fd7e1933299677ffb\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=1\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n<p><em>Pictured at the top of the page, left to right: Jeffrey Evans, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/alex-pall\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"alex-pall\">Alex Pall, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/drew-taggart\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"drew-taggart\">Drew Taggart, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Milan Koch.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Alex Pall and Drew Taggart are best known as The Chainsmokers, an electronic DJ and production duo whose first three albums have given rise to numerous Billboard chart-topping songs, four Grammy nominations and one Grammy award, for the song &#8220;Don&#8217;t Let Me Down.&#8221; Soon, they hope they&#8217;ll be known as savvy venture investors, too.
