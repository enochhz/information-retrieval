But on this record \u2014 while the government has established that China\u2019s activities raise significant national- security concerns \u2014 it has put in scant little evidence that its effective ban of WeChat for all U.S. users addresses those concerns. And, as the plaintiffs point out, there are obvious alternatives to a complete ban, such as barring WeChat from government devices, as Australia has done, or taking other steps to address data security.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Given the likelihood of a lawsuit proceeding and the immediate damage a ban would have if implemented, the judge initiated a nationwide injunction against implementation of the Commerce Department\u2019s order to ban the app.<\/p>\n<p>Commerce will have a chance to respond to this development, and whether it chooses to edit its order, pursue other avenues through the courts, or just rescind the order entirely, we will see in the coming days.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A few days ago, the U.S. Commerce Department published a series of rules that aimed to block the downloading of TikTok and WeChat by American users, following an executive order signed by President Trump back in August.

Users collected these cricket-themed stickers for sending money to others, or making transactions such as topping up credit on their phone or paying their broadband or electricity bill.<\/p>\n<p>In a statement on Sunday evening, a Google spokesperson said, \u201coffering cashbacks and vouchers alone do not constitute a violation of our Google Play gambling policies\u201d and that Play Store \u201cpolicies are applied and enforced on all developers consistently.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But it\u2019s arguably anything but consistent.<\/p>\n<p>On September 18, Google told Paytm that it had pulled its app for not complying with Play Store\u2019s \u201cgambling policy\u201d as it offered games with \u201cloyalty points.\u201d Paytm said that Google had not expressed any concerns over Paytm\u2019s new marketing campaign prior to its notice on Friday, in which it revealed that Paytm app had been temporarily removed from the Play Store.<\/p>\n<p>But Google itself is running a similar campaign linked to cricket in India, Paytm argues. (Why cricket? Cricket is immensely popular in India and one of the biggest cricket tournaments globally, Indian Premier League, kicked off its latest season on Saturday.)<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2049284\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2049284\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2049284 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"286\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg 3284w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=150,42 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=300,84 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=768,214 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=680,190 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=1536,428 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=2048,571 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=50,14 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2049284\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cricket-themed cashback offered by Paytm (left) and Google Pay (right) in India<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Google Play Store in India has long prohibited apps that promote gambling such as betting on sporting events, and Google has raised concerns about Paytm&#8217;s marquee app promoting Paytm First Games, a fantasy sports app run by Paytm, in the past.<\/p>\n<p>Paytm executives argued that <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/phonepe\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"phonepe\">PhonePe, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> a Walmart-owned payments app in India, also promoted Dream11, the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/indian-fantasy-sports-app-dream11s-parent-firm-raises-225m-at-over-2-5b-valuation\/\">most popular fantasy sports app in the country<\/a>, and got away without any action.<\/p>\n<p>Google also permits fantasy sports app operators &#8212; including Paytm &#8212; to advertise on Search in India.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-theme=\"light\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Where is Google hypocritical?

The removal of Paytm app was only on the grounds of Paytm offering cricket-themed cashback, he claimed. \u201cGoogle is not allowing us to acquire new customers right now. That\u2019s all what this is,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s payments app, Google Pay, competes with Paytm in India. In fact, Google Pay is the largest payments app for peer-to-peer transaction between users in India and holds the largest market share in UPI.<\/p>\n<p>Without identifying any names, Sharma, the poster child of Indian startup ecosystem, claimed that many founders in India have just accepted that it is Google that has the final say on any matter in India &#8212; and not the country\u2019s regulatory agencies.<\/p>\n<p>For Google, which reaches more users than any other company in India and whose Android operating system commands 99% of the local smartphone market, this kind of accusation is exactly what it needs to avoid in the country. The Silicon Valley search and advertising giant has launched a charm offensive in India, including a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/13\/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india\/\">recently commitment to invest $10 billion<\/a> &#8212;\u00a0more than any other American or Chinese technology firm.<\/p>\n<p>The timing for Google&#8217;s parent company, Alphabet, couldn&#8217;t be worse. Google is currently the <a href=\"https:\/\/in.reuters.com\/article\/us-india-google-antitrust-exclusive\/exclusive-google-faces-antitrust-case-in-india-over-payments-app-sources-idUKKBN2331G3\">subject of an antitrust complaint<\/a> in India over an allegation that it has abused its market position to unfairly promote its mobile payments app in the country; and in the U.S., Congress has intimidated that it may pursue antitrust regulatory action against Alphabet and Apple over app store concerns.<\/p>\n<p>In India, Google&#8217;s moves could have a devastating impact on businesses and everyday consumers.<\/p>\n<p>Paytm is not just a payments app. It is also a fully licensed digital bank. And just an eight-hour of absence from the Play Store created a panic among a portion of its users. A source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that Paytm saw several people withdraw their fixed deposit in Paytm Payments Bank on Friday.<\/p>\n<p>Anecdotally, TechCrunch heard of instances where vendors who previously preferred Paytm for accepting money digitally asked their customers to use a different payments method as they had heard that Paytm was \u201cbanned\u201d in India.<\/p>\n<p>Sharma said Google&#8217;s monopoly on Indian app ecosystem is of a magnitude unparalleled elsewhere in the world.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf paying someone and getting a cashback is gambling, then the same rule should be applied to everyone,\u201d said Sharma. \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful that we are standing here at the cusp of an internet revolution in India and we are being sanctioned by companies that are not governed by the law of this country.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If this sentiment gained traction in India it could create challenges for Google&#8217;s future in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. is forcing a Chinese company to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/19\/tiktok-deal-terms\/\">sell stakes to local firms to continue operations in the country<\/a>. In a recent episode of Dithering podcast, Ben Thompson cautioned that Trump administration\u2019s move &#8212; which some have argued is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/08\/18\/opinion\/tiktok-wechat-ban-trump.html\">a long due tit for tat against Chinese companies<\/a> (as China has long prevented U.S. firms from meaningfully operating in the world&#8217;s largest \u00a0internet market) &#8212;\u00a0might encourage\u00a0other open markets to do to American firms what it is doing to TikTok.<\/p>\n<p>Several U.S. tech executives share these concerns.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The problem with this TikTok deal is that the US is the largest player in tech globally.

capitalism and the American theft of Chinese innovation"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">It used to be \u201ceasy\u201d to tell the American and Chinese economies apart. One was innovative, one made clones. One was a free market while the other demanded payments to a political party and its leadership, a corrupt wealth generating scam that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/business\/global\/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html\">by some estimates<\/a> has netted top leaders billions of dollars. One kept the talent borders porous acting as a magnet for the world\u2019s top brains while the other interviewed you in a backroom at the airport before imprisoning you on sedition charges (okay, that might have been both).<\/p>\n<p>The comparison was always facile yes, but it was easy and at least directionally accurate if failing on the specifics.<\/p>\n<p>Now though, the country that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2019\/04\/lithium-ion-batteries-amazon-are-exploding\/587005\/\">exported exploding batteries<\/a> is pioneering quantum computing, while the country that pioneered the internet <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/03\/made-in-america-is-on-government-life-support-and-the-prognosis-isnt-good\/\">now builds planes that fall out of the sky<\/a> (and good news, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/boeing-flags-additional-787-production-problem-11599577936\">we\u2019ve identified even more planes<\/a> that might fall out of the sky at an airport near you!)<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tiktok\">TikTok\u2019s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> success is many things, but it is quite frankly just an embarrassment for the United States. There are thousands of entrepreneurs and hundreds of venture capitalists swarming Silicon Valley and the other American innovation hubs looking for the next great social app or building it themselves. But the power law of user growth and investor returns happens to reside in Haidian, Beijing. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/bytedance\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"bytedance\">ByteDance <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> through its local apps in China and overseas apps like TikTok <i>is<\/i> the consumer investor return of the past decade (there\u2019s a reason why all the IPOs this seasons are enterprise SaaS).<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a win that you can\u2019t chalk up just to industrial policy. Unlike in semiconductors or other capital-intensive industries where Beijing can offer billions in incentives to spur development, ByteDance builds apps. It distributes them on app stores across the world. It has exactly the same tools available to it that every entrepreneur with an Apple Developer account has access to. There is no <a href=\"https:\/\/www.csis.org\/analysis\/made-china-2025\">Made in China 2025<\/a> plan to build and popularize a consumer app like TikTok (you literally can\u2019t plan for consumer success like that). Instead, it\u2019s a well-executed product that\u2019s addictive to hundreds of millions of people.<\/p>\n<p>So much as China protected its industry from overseas competitors like Google and Amazon through market-entry barriers, America is now protecting its entrenched incumbents from overseas competitors like TikTok. We\u2019re demanding joint ventures and local cloud data sovereignty just as the Communist Party has demanded for years.<\/p>\n<p>Hell, we\u2019re apparently demanding a $5 billion tax payment from ByteDance, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-09-20\/trump-wants-5-billion-from-tiktok-deal-for-new-history-project\">which the president says will fund patriotic education for youth<\/a>. The president says a lot of things of course, but at least the $5 billion price point has been confirmed by Oracle in its press release over night (what the tax revenue will <i>actually<\/i> be used for is anyone\u2019s guess). If you followed the recent Hong Kong protests for a long time, you will remember that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-hongkong-patriotism\/hong-kong-frets-over-china-model-patriotic-education-idUSBRE86A09L20120711\">patriotic youth education<\/a> was some of the original tinder for those demonstrations back in 2012. What comes around, goes around, I guess.<\/p>\n<p>Development economists like to talk about \u201ccatch-up\u201d strategies, tactics that countries can take to avoid the middle income trap and cut the gap between the West and the rest. But what we need now are developed economists to explain America\u2019s \u201cfall behind\u201d strategy. Because we are falling behind, in pretty much everything.<\/p>\n<p>As the TikTok process and the earlier Huawei imbroglio show, America is no longer on the leading edge of technology in many key strategic markets. Mainland Chinese companies are globally winning in areas as diverse as 5G and social networks, and without direct government intervention to kill that innovation, American and European tech purveyors would have lost those markets entirely (and even <i>with<\/i> those interventions, they may still lose them). In Taiwan, TSMC has come from behind Intel to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/051b2c80-d53b-410e-8e80-f433d25a82dd\">take a year or two lead<\/a> in the fabrication of the most advanced semiconductors.<\/p>\n<p>I mean, we can\u2019t even pilfer Chinese history and mythology and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/21428088\/mulan-review-disney-live-action-remake\">turn it into a decent god damn film<\/a> these days.<\/p>\n<p>And the fall-behind strategy continues. Immigration restrictions from an administration hell-bent on destroying the single greatest source of American innovation, coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic, have fused into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/international-student-enrollment-trump-covid19-5caad69c-f6d4-4b79-bfb4-7b6ed038bc5b.html\">the largest single drop in international student migration in American history<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Why does that matter? In the U.S. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.insidehighered.com\/quicktakes\/2017\/10\/11\/foreign-students-and-graduate-stem-enrollment\">according to relatively recent data<\/a>, 81% of electrical engineering grad students are international, 79% in computer science are, and in most engineering and technical fields, the number hovers above a majority.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s great to believe the fantasy that if only these international grad students would stay home, then \u201creal\u201d Americans would somehow take these slots. But what\u2019s true of the strawberry pickers and food service workers is also true for EE grad students: proverbial \u201cAmericans\u201d don\u2019t want these jobs. They are hard jobs, thankless jobs, and require a ridiculous tenacity that American workers and students by and large don\u2019t have. These industries have huge contingents of foreign workers precisely because no one domestic wants to take these roles.<\/p>\n<p>So goes the talent, so goes the innovation. Without this wellspring of brainpower lodging itself in America\u2019s top innovation hubs, where exactly do we think it will go? That former aspiring Stanford or MIT computer scientist with ideas in his or her brain isn\u2019t just going to sit by the window gazing at the horizon waiting for the moment when they can enter the gilded halls of the U.S. of A. It\u2019s the internet era, and they are just going to get started on their dreams wherever they are, using whatever tools and resources they have available to them.<\/p>\n<p>All you have to do is look at the recent YC batches and realize that the future cohorts of great startups are going to increasingly come from outside the continental 48. Dozens of smart, brilliant entrepreneurs aren\u2019t even trying to migrate, instead rightfully seeing their home markets as more open to innovation and technological progress than the vaunted superpower. The frontier is closed here, and it has moved elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>So what are we left with here in the U.S. and increasingly Europe? A narrow-minded policy of blocking external tech innovation to ensure that our sclerotic and entrenched incumbents don\u2019t have to compete with the best in the world. If that isn\u2019t a recipe for economic disaster, I don\u2019t know what is.<\/p>\n<p>But hey: at least the youth will be patriotic.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It used to be \u201ceasy\u201d to tell the American and Chinese economies apart.

subscription monetization to more apps in 2016 \u2014 and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2016\/6\/8\/11880730\/apple-app-store-subscription-update-phil-schiller-interview\">enticed developers with an 85\/15 split<\/a> on revenue from customers that remain subscribed for more than a year \u2014 subscription monetization and retention has felt like the Holy Grail for app developers. So much so that <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/googleplay\/android-developer\/answer\/112622?hl=en\">Google quickly followed suit<\/a>\u00a0in what appeared to be an example of healthy competition for developers in the mobile OS duopoly.<\/p>\n<p>But how does that split actually work out for most apps? Turns out, the 85\/15 split \u2014 which Apple is keen to mention anytime developers complain about the App Store rev share \u2014 doesn\u2019t have a meaningful impact for most developers. Because churn.<\/p>\n<p>No matter how great an app is, subscribers are going to churn. Sometimes it\u2019s because of a credit card expiring or some other billing issue. And sometimes it\u2019s more of a pause, and the user comes back after a few months. But the majority of churn comes from subscribers who, for whatever reason, decide that the app just isn\u2019t worth paying for anymore. If a subscriber churns before the one-year mark, the developer never sees that 85% split. And even if the user resubscribes, Apple and Google reset the clock if a subscription has lapsed for more than 60 days. Rather convenient\u2026 for Apple and Google.<\/p>\n<p>Top mobile apps like Netflix and Spotify report churn rates in the low single digits, but they are the outliers. According to our data, the median churn rate for subscription apps is around\u00a013% for monthly subscriptions\u00a0and around 50% for annual. Monthly subscription churn is generally a bit higher in the first few months, then it tapers off. But an average churn of 13% leaves just 20% of subscribers crossing that magical 85\/15 threshold.<\/p>\n<p>In practice, what this means is that, for all the hype around the 85\/15 split, very few developers are going to see a meaningful increase in revenue:<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2048964\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img

has slowed down deal-making across the world, dozens of startups in India have raised considerable amounts in recent months. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/unacademy\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"unacademy\">Unacademy, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> which <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/19\/facebook-backs-indian-education-startup-unacademy\/\">raised $110 million<\/a> in February, closed a new <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/02\/indias-online-learning-platform-unacademy-raises-150-million-at-1-45-billion-valuation\/\">round of $150 million this month<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>These large check sizes, and the frequency at which they are being bandied out, were almost unheard of in India just 10 years ago. The list of problems these local startups were solving then was also quite smaller back in the day.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BKartRed\">Karthik Reddy<\/a> has seen this change very closely.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>He co-founded venture capital firm <a href=\"https:\/\/blume.vc\">Blume Ventures<\/a>, where he also serves as a partner, 10 years ago. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/blume-ventures\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"blume-ventures\">Blume Ventures <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> is the largest Indian venture capital firm.\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">In a wide-ranging interview at <\/span><a style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/disrupt-sf-2020\/?promo=leftnav\">Disrupt 2020<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">, Reddy talked about the state of the startup ecosystem in India, some of the challenges it is confronting today and what lies ahead for the market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u201cFifteen years is what you should consider the active VC build-out in India. For the first five to seven years, we were kind of faking it till we make it. We sold the idea that we can replicate what the U.S. and China have done,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>The breakout moment in India happened when low-cost Android smartphones flooded the market. A handful of startups with consumer-facing services such as Flipkart, Paytm and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/zomato\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"zomato\">Zomato <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> emerged to serve the first tens of millions of smartphone users in the country.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Hail Mary moment there was Reliance Jio\u2019s arrival in the market,\u201d he said. India\u2019s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, entered the telecommunications market in the second half of 2016 with the world\u2019s cheapest mobile tariff.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, for several months, Ambani simply did not charge Jio subscribers anything for access to 4G data. So India at large, once conscious about each megabyte it spent on the internet, suddenly started consuming gigabytes of content everyday. \u201cIt democratized data and smartphones at a scale that we have not seen in countries other than China,\u201d said Reddy.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2047979\" style=\"width: 698px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2047979\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical wp-image-2047979 \" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/karthik-reddy-blume-ventures.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"688\" height=\"1032\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/karthik-reddy-blume-ventures.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/karthik-reddy-blume-ventures.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/karthik-reddy-blume-ventures.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/karthik-reddy-blume-ventures.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/karthik-reddy-blume-ventures.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/karthik-reddy-blume-ventures.jpg?resize=33,50 33w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2047979\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Karthik Reddy is the co-founder of Blume Ventures, the largest Indian venture capital firm<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>As hundreds of millions of users in India arrived on the internet, scores of startups in the country started to solve more complex problems: Bangalore-based startup Meesho today is helping <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/06\/13\/facebook-meesho-first-indian-startup-investment\/\">millions of women sell products digitally<\/a>; Classplus, a Blume Ventures-backed startup, has built <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/03\/classplus-coaching-centers-teachers-online\/\">a Shopify-like platform for teachers and coaching centres<\/a> to serve students directly.<\/p>\n<p>As India grew into the world\u2019s second largest internet consumer, it has also attracted American and Chinese technology groups, all of which are looking for their next billion users. Several major investment firms, including Silver Lake, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/alibaba\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"alibaba\">Alibaba Group, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Tencent, GGV Capital, Tiger Global, General Atlantic, KKR, Vista, and Owl Ventures have also arrived and become aggressive in their investments in recent years.<\/p>\n<p>But the geo-political tension between India and China have slightly complicated matters. In April this year, India <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/18\/to-avoid-hostile-takeovers-amid-covid-19-india-mandates-approvals-on-chinese-investments\/\">amended its foreign direct investment policy<\/a> to China to seek approval from New Delhi for their future deals in the country. Chinese investors have ploughed billions of dollars into the Indian startup ecosystem in recent years.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a sensitive topic, given the involvement of the government, that most VCs in India are not comfortable addressing it even off the record. But Reddy weighed in.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf not an arm or limb, it cuts off a finger or two for your choices. You are a little handicapped,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a caveat to that. It\u2019s limited to certain segments of the market. I don\u2019t think China and Hong Kong investors, even though they were very familiar with Chinese VC success story, were really interested in India\u2019s deep tech and cross-border tech,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Today those areas account for more than a third of the robust ecosystem in India, Reddy argued. \u201cIf you look at the entire ecosystem collectively, there&#8217;s a single-digit influence of Chinese capital. [&#8230;] If you ask me personally, 40% of my portfolio is not even remotely affected by it,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>But several large consumer-facing Indian startups, such as Paytm, Zomato and Udaan, do have Chinese investors on their cap tables. Reddy said they would be impacted as uncertainty looms over when &#8212; and if &#8212; India would offer any relaxation to its current stand.<\/p>\n<p>He said he is hopeful that the government would provide some distinction to VC-managed fund money that is not necessarily Chinese just because it\u2019s run by someone who originated there.<\/p>\n<p>Reddy also spoke about why he thinks early-stage startups, despite the proliferation of VC firms in India focusing on young firms, continue to receive less attention. We also spoke about how the coronavirus is impacting his portfolio startups and the industry at large and what advice he has for startup founders to navigate the turbulence times.

(You can see a demo of how it works below provided by the company&#8217;s head of data, Brittany Davis.)<\/p>\n<p>The new data-as-a-service is\u00a0also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.narrator.ai\/pricing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">priced<\/a> in SaaS tiers, with a free tier for the first 5 million rows of data, and a sliding scale of pricing after that based on data rows, user numbers and Narratives in use.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2048032\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2048032\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2048032 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Narratives-Analyses-Narrator.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2048032\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits: Narrator<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Elsamadisi, who co-founded the startup with Matt Star, Cedric Dussud and Michael Nason, said that data analysts have long lived with the problems with star schema modelling (and by extension the related format of snowflake schema), which can be summed up as &#8220;layers of dependencies, lack of source of truth, numbers not matching and endless maintenance,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;At its core, when you have lots of tables built from lots of complex SQL, you end up with a growing house of cards requiring the need to constantly hire more people to help make sure it doesn&#8217;t collapse.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>(We)Work Experience<\/h2>\n<p>It was while he was working as lead data scientist at WeWork &#8212; yes, he told me, maybe it\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2019\/08\/no-wework-isnt-a-tech-company-heres-why-that-matters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wasn&#8217;t actually a tech company<\/a>, but it had &#8220;tech at its core&#8221; &#8212; that he had a breakthrough moment of realising how to restructure data to get around these issues.<\/p>\n<p>Before that, things were tough on the data front. WeWork\u00a0had 700 tables that his team was managing using a star schema approach, covering 85 systems and 13,000 objects. Data would include information on acquiring buildings, to the flows of customers through those buildings, how things would change and customers might churn, with marketing and activity on social networks, and so on, growing in line with the company&#8217;s own rapidly scaling empire. \u00a0All of that meant a mess at the data end.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Data analysts wouldn&#8217;t be able to do their jobs,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It turns out we could barely even answer basic questions about sales numbers. Nothing matched up, and everything took too long.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The team had 45 people on it, but even so it ended up having to implement a hierarchy for answering questions, as there were so many and not enough time to dig through and answer them all. &#8220;And we had every data tool there was,&#8221; he added. &#8220;My team hated everything they did.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The single-table column model that Narrator uses, he said, &#8220;had been theorised&#8221; in the past but hadn&#8217;t been figured out.<\/p>\n<p>The spark, he said, was to think of data structured in the same way that we ask questions, where &#8212; as he described it &#8212; each piece of data can be bridged together and then also used to answer multiple questions.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The main difference is we&#8217;re using a time-series table to replace all your data modelling,&#8221; Elsamadisi explained. &#8220;This is not a new idea, but it was always considered impossible.\u00a0In short, we tackle the same problem as most data companies to make it easier to get the data you want but we are the only company that solves it by innovating on the lowest-level data modelling approach. Honestly, that is why our solution works so well. We rebuilt the foundation of data instead of trying to make a faulty foundation better.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Narrator calls the composite table, which includes all of your data reformatted to fit in its 11-column structure, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.narrator.ai\/how-it-works\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Activity Stream<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Elsamadisi said using Narrator for the first time takes about 30 minutes, and about a month to learn to use it thoroughly. &#8220;But you&#8217;re not going back to SQL after that, it&#8217;s so much faster,&#8221; he added.<\/p>\n<p>Narrator&#8217;s initial market has been providing services to other tech companies, and specifically startups, but the plan is to open it up to a much wider set of verticals. And in a move that might help with that, longer term, it also plans to open source some of its core components so that third parties can build data products on top of the framework more quickly.<\/p>\n<p>As for competitors, he says that it&#8217;s essentially the tools that he and other data scientists have always used, although &#8220;we&#8217;re going against a &#8216;best practice&#8217; approach (star schema), not a company.&#8221; Airflow, DBT, Looker&#8217;s LookML, Chartio&#8217;s Visual SQL, Tableau Prep are all ways to create and enable the use of a traditional star schema, he added. &#8220;We&#8217;re similar to these companies &#8212; trying to make it as easy and efficient as possible to generate the tables you need for BI, reporting and analysis &#8212; but those companies are limited by the traditional star schema approach.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So far the proof has been in the data. Narrator says that c<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">ompanies average around 20 transformations (the unit used to answer questions) compared to hundreds in a star schema, and that those tr<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">ansformations average 22 lines compared to 1,000+ lines in traditional modelling. For those that learn how to use it, the average time for generating a report or running some analysis is four minutes, compared to weeks in traditional data modelling.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u201cNarrator has the potential to set a new standard in data,\u201d said Jen Wolf, \u200bInitialized Capital COO and partner and new Narrator board member\u200b, in a statement. \u201cWe were amazed to see the quality and speed with which Narrator delivered analyses using their product. We\u2019re confident once the world experiences Narrator this will be how data analysis is taught moving forward.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"vimeo-player\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/455915966\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Snowflake went public this week, and in a mark of the wider ecosystem that is evolving around data warehousing, a startup that has built a completely new concept for modelling warehoused data is announcing funding.

Irene<\/a>&#8216;s path to becoming a partner at one of Southeast Asia&#8217;s most esteemed venture capital firms is an unconventional one.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I always consider myself to be quite lucky,&#8221; said Irene, who was promoted to be a partner at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/east-ventures\">East Ventures<\/a> in January 2019. At 25 years old, she was the Jakarta-based investment firm&#8217;s first female partner.<\/p>\n<p>During TechCrunch Disrupt&#8217;s first online conference, I spoke to Irene about what she humbly described as a &#8220;lucky&#8221; career, her experience as a young, female investor, the rush of American and Chinese VC money into Southeast Asia and what the COVID-19 pandemic means to <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/east-ventures\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"east-ventures\">East Ventures <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>. A video recording of the conversation is at the bottom of the article.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<h2>Partner at 25<\/h2>\n<p>Irene admitted that timing played a big part in her ascension in the VC world. The development of Indonesia&#8217;s internet infrastructure came around relatively late &#8212; around 2010 &#8212; compared to more developed markets, but growth happened rapidly. In 2015, five years after East Ventures backed the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/tokopedia\/company_financials\/funding_rounds\">Series A<\/a> of Tokopedia, now an e-commerce leader in Southeast Asia, Irene joined the firm.<\/p>\n<p>In those days, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t compete with a lot of investment bankers,&#8221; said Irene, who majored in accounting in university and began as an intern at East Ventures. &#8220;The capability that they looked for was how fast you can immerse in the ecosystem.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, the Southeast Asian investment ecosystem is &#8220;quite friendly&#8221; toward women. &#8220;People rejoice the promotion of female professionals in this industry. It&#8217;s not a rare circumstance to see females becoming a vice principal or principle in Southeast Asia,&#8221; the investor said.<\/p>\n<p>The support goes beyond simply checking the gender-diversity box and reflects a real demand for more empathetic investors in the tech industry.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Sometimes people like to talk as a business partner and sometimes as a friend. [Empathy] is something that can be seen as natural coming from females,&#8221; she added.<\/p>\n<p>However, the investor cautioned that &#8220;the number of [female] decision-makers definitely needs to improve,&#8221; though she foresees the local ecosystem &#8220;is supportive of that.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>SEA gold rush<\/h2>\n<p>In recent years tech giants from both the U.S. and China have been clamoring to get into Southeast Asia, a region home to about 670 million people and a fledgling internet market. They often begin by financing local upstarts, which, beholden to the investment, will provide directional advice to their foreign corporate investors.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, the familiar names have all bet on the region&#8217;s rising stars. Alibaba invested in <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/tokopedia\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tokopedia\">Tokopedia <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and its rival <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/07\/28\/expedia-invests-350m-in-traveloka\/\">JD.com-backed travel portal Traveloka<\/a>, which is also in the East Ventures portfolio. Tencent, Google, Facebook and PayPal are <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/02\/facebook-and-paypal-invest-in-southeast-asian-ride-hailing-giant-gojek\/\">all investors of Gojek<\/a>, the Indonesian ride-hailing titan going neck and neck with<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/29\/softbank-pumps-2b-into-indonesia-through-new-grab-investment-putting-it-head-to-head-with-gojek\/\"> SoftBank-funded Grab<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>When offered big checks, startups must stay level-headed and think what&#8217;s best for them, Irene advised. &#8220;The thing is everyone has money. Companies need to decide which side to be on, what companies they want on board, and what companies are able to give them strategic advice.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not uncommon to see investors and founders clash over priorities. Some investors want a quick exit, while the entrepreneurial mentality is to build a business in the long run. &#8220;That&#8217;s why alignment is important,&#8221; asserted the investor.<\/p>\n<h2>The future of tech in SEA<\/h2>\n<p>As unicorns and &#8220;super apps&#8221; like <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/grabtaxi\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"grabtaxi\">Grab <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and Gojek emerge in Southeast Asia, concerns that incumbents can kill off competition grow. East Ventures has a unique insight into the region&#8217;s competitive dynamics as an early-stage investor that has seen some of its startups like Tokopedia and Traveloka grow into behemoths.<\/p>\n<p>Irene believes as Southeast Asia&#8217;s internet ecosystem matures, there are actually a lot of opportunities for startups in &#8220;upcoming sectors.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If you look at the unicorns, you see a lot of younger and smaller companies supporting them,&#8221; she said. The point is that giants can&#8217;t accomplish everything by themselves, and some of the more niche functions can best be tackled by smaller players with specialized focuses.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, the investor believed consolidation is possible &#8212; and should happen &#8212; in areas that can benefit from scale and network effects.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;People think of Indonesia as one country. We are not. We are the largest archipelago, which means there are very different infrastructures within different provinces. For example, it&#8217;s expensive to set up a bank branch in a small island&#8230; That means a lot of things need to come into a collective effort and one big ecosystem to offer the consumers with different kinds of offerings.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, there&#8217;s the inevitable question of COVID-19. Like many investors, Irene saw a silver lining during the dark times.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Before COVID, it was very difficult to assess the quality of companies. They all had a lot of money and the infrastructure was actually good&#8230; Now we suddenly can tell who makes good decisions, who makes it at what speed, and what is the outcome of those decisions. The way entrepreneurs respond to COVID can tell us a lot about their enterprises.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f5c0f26b65dff2c9a07d8ec\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Melisa Irene&#8216;s path to becoming a partner at one of Southeast Asia&#8217;s most esteemed venture capital firms is an unconventional one. &#8220;I always consider myself to be quite lucky,&#8221; said Irene, who was promoted to be a partner at East Ventures in January 2019.

href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/interswitch-inc\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"interswitch-inc\">Interswitch <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> plans to fire up its corporate venture arm again \u2014 according to CEO <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/mr-mitchell-elegbe\">Mitchell Elegbe<\/a> \u2014 who spoke at <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/video\/making-bank\/\">TechCrunch Disrupt<\/a> on Wednesday.<\/p>\n<p>The Nigerian founder didn&#8217;t offer much new on the Lagos-based firm&#8217;s expected IPO, but he did reveal Interswitch will revive investments in African startups.<\/p>\n<p>Founded by Elegbe in 2002, Interswitch pioneered the infrastructure to digitize Nigeria\u2019s then predominantly cash-based economy. The company now provides much of the rails for Nigeria\u2019s online banking system that serves Africa\u2019s largest economy and population of 200 million people. Interswitch has expanded to offer personal and business payment products in 23 African countries.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The fintech firm<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/11\/nigerias-interswitch-confirms-1b-valuation-after-visa-investment\/\"> achieved unicorn status in 2019<\/a> after a $200 million equity investment by Visa gave it a $1 billion valuation.<\/p>\n<h2>Reviving venture investing<\/h2>\n<p>Interswitch, which is well beyond startup phase, launched a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/11\/nigerias-interswitch-confirms-1b-valuation-after-visa-investment\/\">$10 million venture arm in 2015<\/a> that has been dormant since 2016, after <a href=\"https:\/\/techcabal.com\/2016\/09\/29\/interswitch-has-officially-completed-the-acquisition-of-vanso\/\">it acquired Vanso<\/a> \u2014 a Nigerian fintech security company.<\/p>\n<p>But Interswitch will soon be back in the business of making startup bets and acquisitions, according to Elegbe. &#8220;We&#8217;ve just certified a team and the plan is to begin to make those kinds of investments again.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>He offered a glimpse into the new fund&#8217;s focus. &#8220;This time around we want to make financial investments and also leverage the network that Interswitch has and put that at the disposal of these companies,&#8221; Elegbe told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be very selective in the companies we invest in. They should be companies that Interswitch clearly as an entity can add value to. They should be companies that help accelerate growth by the virtue of what we do and the customers that we have,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Recent venture events in African tech have likely pressed Interswitch to get back in the investing arena. As an ecosystem, VC on the continent has increased (roughly) by a factor of four over the last five years, to around<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/04\/did-african-startups-raise-496m-1b-or-2b-in-2019\/\"> $2 billion in 2019<\/a>. But most of that has come from single-entity investment funds, while corporate venture funding (and tech M&amp;A activity) has remained light. That&#8217;s shifted over the last several months and the entire uptick has occurred in African fintech around entities that could be viewed as Interswitch competitors.<\/p>\n<p>In July, Dubai&#8217;s Network International acquired Kenya-based mobile payment processing company <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theafricareport.com\/41978\/dpo-will-tap-african-market-for-acquisitions-after-network-takeover\/\">DPO for $288 million<\/a>. Shortly after the acquisition, DPO&#8217;s CEO Eran Feinstein said the company would pursue more African acquisitions on its own. In June, another mobile-money payment processor, MFS Africa, <a href=\"https:\/\/ventureburn.com\/2020\/06\/fintech-mfs-africa-acquires-beyonic\/\">acquired digital finance company<\/a> Beyonic. And in August, South Africa&#8217;s Standard Bank \u2014 Africa&#8217;s largest by assets and lending \u2014 acquired a stake in fintech <a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsafrica.com\/standard-bank-acquires-35-stake-in-south-african-fintech-tradesafe\/#:~:text=Standard%20Bank%20has%20today%20announced,in%20South%20African%20fintech%2C%20TradeSafe.&amp;text=Our%20fees%20come%20in%20at,executive%20directors%20to%20the%20board.\">security firm TradeSafe<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Since the rise of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/30\/visa-and-kenyas-safaricom-partner-on-m-pesa-payments-and-tech\/\">Safaricom&#8217;s dominant M-Pesa<\/a> mobile money product in Kenya, fintech in Africa has become infinitely larger and more competitive. The sector has hundreds of startups and now receives nearly 50% of all VC investment on the continent.<\/p>\n<p>The opportunity investors and founders are chasing is bringing Africa&#8217;s large unbanked population and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/u\/underbanked.asp\">underbanked<\/a> consumers and SMEs online. Roughly 66% of <a href=\"https:\/\/data.worldbank.org\/indicator\/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=ZG\">Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s 1 billion<\/a> people don\u2019t have a bank account, according to World Bank data, and mobile-based finance platforms have presented the best use cases to shift that across the region.<\/p>\n<p>Interswitch has established itself as a leader in Africa&#8217;s digital finance race. But it&#8217;s hard to envision how it can maintain or extend that role without an active venture arm that invests in and acquires innovative, young fintech startups.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f624baf2be1612af5438259\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n<h2>No news on IPO<\/h2>\n<p>Elegbe had less to offer on Interswitch&#8217;s long-anticipated IPO. Asked if the company still planned to list publicly, he offered up a non-answer answer. &#8220;At this point in time we&#8217;re focused on growing the business and creating value for our customers and that is our primary focus.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>When pressed &#8220;yes or no&#8221; on whether an IPO was still a possibility, Elegbe confirmed it was. &#8220;We have private equity investors and at some point in the life of the business they want exits,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When it is time for them to exit there are various options on the table and an IPO is an option.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s been talk of an Interswitch IPO for years. In 2016, Elegbe told TechCrunch a dual-listing on the Lagos and London Stock Exchanges was possible. Then word came through other Interswitch channels that it was delayed due to recession and currency volatility in Nigeria in 2017. In November 2019, a source with knowledge of the situation told TechCrunch on background, \u201can IPO is still very much in the cards; likely sometime in the first half of 2020.\u201d Then came the COVID-19 crisis and the accompanying global economic slump, which may have delayed Interswitch&#8217;s IPO plans yet again.<\/p>\n<p>If and when the company goes public, it would be a major event for Nigerian and African fintech. No VC-backed fintech firm on the continent has listed globally. Exits for Interswitch&#8217;s investors would likely attract to Nigeria and broader Africa more VC from major funds \u2014 many of which remain on the fence about startup opportunities on the continent.<\/p>\n<h2>Focus on Africa<\/h2>\n<p>On global product expansion, Interswitch plans to maintain an African focus for now, Elegbe explained. &#8220;There are enough opportunities for Interswitch on the continent. We&#8217;d like to be in as many African countries as possible&#8230;and position Interswitch as the (financial) gateway to the continent,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Elegbe explained the company would continue to work through alliances with major financial services firms to open up global financial access for its African client base. In August 2019, Interswitch launched a partnership that allows its Verve cardholders to make payments on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.discover.com\/\">Discover\u2019s<\/a>\u00a0global network.<\/p>\n<p>CEO <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/mr-mitchell-elegbe\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"mr-mitchell-elegbe\">Mitchell Elegbe <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> concluded his Disrupt session with some perspective on balancing the stigmas and possibilities of doing business in Nigeria. Over recent years the country has shifted to become an unofficial hub for big tech expansion, VC investment and startup formation in Africa. But Nigeria continues to have a difficult operating environment with regard to infrastructure and is often associated with political corruption and instability in its Northeast region due to the Boko Haram insurgency.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Nigeria has a very large population and a very large market. We have lots of challenges that need to be solved, but it makes sense to me that lots of money is finding its way to Nigeria because the opportunity is there,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Elegbe&#8217;s advice to tech investors considering the country, &#8220;Don&#8217;t take a short-termist view. There are good people on the ground doing fantastic work \u2014 honest people who want to make impact. You need to seek those people out.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"HMN1tKP4cM\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/04\/why-covid-19-could-delay-interswitch-africas-next-big-ipo\/\">Why COVID-19 could delay Interswitch, Africa&#8217;s next big IPO<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Why COVID-19 could delay Interswitch, Africa&#8217;s next big IPO&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/04\/why-covid-19-could-delay-interswitch-africas-next-big-ipo\/embed\/#?secret=HMN1tKP4cM\" data-secret=\"HMN1tKP4cM\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Pan-African fintech company Interswitch plans to fire up its corporate venture arm again \u2014 according to CEO Mitchell Elegbe \u2014 who spoke at TechCrunch Disrupt on Wednesday.

Its modular, IoT-powered vertical farming units claim to use 99.5% less space than soil-based agriculture, 95% less water, 90% less transport and <em>zero<\/em> chemical pesticides. In addition, 90% of electricity used throughout the Infarm network is from renewable energy and the company has set a target to reach zero emission food production next year.<\/p>\n<p>Founded in 2013 by <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/osnat-michaeli\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"osnat-michaeli\">Osnat Michaeli, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and brothers Erez and Guy Galonska, Infarm&#8217;s \u201cindoor vertical farming\u201d system is capable of growing herbs, lettuce and other vegetables. It then places these modular farms in a variety of customer-facing city locations, such as grocery stores, restaurants, shopping malls and schools, thus enabling the end-customer to actually pick the produce themselves. To further scale, it also installs Infarms in local distribution centres.<\/p>\n<p>The distributed system is designed to be infinitely scalable \u2014 you simply add more modules, space permitting \u2014 whilst the whole thing is cloud-based, meaning the farms can be monitored and controlled from Infarm\u2019s central control centre. It\u2019s also incredibly data-driven, a combination of IoT, Big Data and cloud analytics akin to \u201cFarming-as-a-Service.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The idea, the founding team told me back <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/06\/26\/infarm\/\">in 2017\u00a0when I profiled the nascent company<\/a>, isn\u2019t just to produce fresher and better-tasting produce and re-introduce forgotten or rare varieties, but to disrupt the supply chain as a whole, which remains inefficient and produces a lot of waste.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBehind our farms is a robust hardware and software platform for precision farming,\u201d explained Michaeli at the time. \u201cEach farming unit is its own individual ecosystem, creating the exact environment our plants need to flourish. We are able to develop growing recipes that tailor the light spectrums, temperature, pH and nutrients to ensure the maximum natural expression of each plant in terms of flavor, colour and nutritional quality.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>On that note, I caught up with two of Infarm&#8217;s founders to get a brief update on the Berlin-headquartered company and to dive a little deeper into how it will continue to scale.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TechCrunch: What assumptions did you make early on that have turned out to be true or, more interestingly, not panned out as expected?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Osnat Michaeli:<\/strong> When we first chatted about four years ago, we were 40 people in Berlin and much of the conversation centered around the potential that our approach to urban vertical farming might have for retailers. While for many it was intriguing as a concept, we couldn\u2019t have imagined that a few years later we would have expanded to almost 10 countries (Japan is on its way) and 30 cities, with partnerships with some of the largest retailers in the world. Our assumptions at the time were that retailers and their customers would be attracted to the taste and freshness of produce that grew right in front of them in the produce section, in our farms.<\/p>\n<p>What we didn\u2019t anticipate was how much and how quickly the demand for a sustainable, transparent and modular approach to farming would grow as we, as society, begin to feel the impact of climate change and supply chain fragility upon our lives, our choices and our food. Of course we also did not anticipate a global pandemic, which has underscored the urgency of building a new food system that can democratize access to high-quality, amazing-tasting food, while helping our planet regenerate and heal. The past few months have confirmed the flexibility and resilience of our farming model, and that our mission is more relevant than ever.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In terms of signing on new retailers, based on your progress in the last 12 months, I&#8217;m guessing this has gotten easier, though undoubtedly there are still quite long lead times. How have these conversations changed since you started?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Erez Galonska:<\/strong> While lead times and speed of conversations can vary depending upon the region and retailer. In mature markets where the concept is familiar and we\u2019re already engaged, deal conversations can reach maturity in as little time as three months. Since we last spoke we are already working with most of the leading retailers that are well established in Europe, U.K. and North America. Brands which in each of their markets are both forerunners in a retail industry rapidly evolving to meet the demand for consumer-focused innovation, while proving that access to sustainable, high-quality, fresh and living produce is not only possible, but can be available in produce aisles today, and every day of the year, with Infarm.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m interested to understand where Infarms are installed, in terms of if the majority is in-store and consumer-facing or if the most scalable and bulk of Infarm&#8217;s use cases are really much larger distribution hubs in cities or close to cities, i.e. not too far away from places with population\/store density but not actually in stores. Perhaps you can enlighten me on what the ratio looks like today and how you see it developing as vertical farming grows?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Erez Galonska:<\/strong> Today across our markets, the split between our farms in stores and in distribution centers is roughly 50\/50. However, as you anticipate, we will be expanding our network this year with many more distribution hubs. This expansion will likely lead to an 80\/20 split as early as next year, with the majority of our regions being served with fresh, living produce delivered throughout the week from centrally located hubs. This not only offers retailers and restaurants flexibility in terms of volumes of output, and the ability to adapt the presentation of our offerings to floor areas of different sizes, but it also allows us to begin to serve whole regions from our next-generation farms under development today.<\/p>\n<p>Based in our hubs, these farms will deliver the crop equivalent of an acre or more of fresh produce on a 25 m2 footprint, with significant further savings in energy, water, labor and land use. We believe this technology will truly challenge ideas of what is possible in sustainable, vertical farming and we look forward to talking about it more soon.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lastly, what are the main product lines in terms of food on the shelves?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Osnat Michaeli:<\/strong> We have a catalog of more than 65 herbs, microgreens and leafy greens that is constantly growing. Our offerings range from the known and common varieties like Coriander, Basil, or Mint, to specialty products like Peruvian Mint, Red Veined Sorrel or Wasabi Rucola.<\/p>\n<p>Because our farms give us excellent control over every part of a plant\u2019s growth process, and can imitate the complexity of different ecosystems, we will be able to expand the diversity of Infarm produce available to consumers to include root vegetables, mushrooms, flowering crops and even superfoods from around the world in the near future. What you see today with Infarm is still only the beginning.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/zA0TLE3f0Ik?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Infarm, the vertical farming company that has built a network of urban farms to grow fresh food closer to consumers, has raised $170 million in new investment in a &#8220;first close&#8221; of a Series C.

We wanted to detail what we know about what happened and the steps that are being taken to make this right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week we are hosting a virtual version of our TechCrunch Disrupt conference from a studio in San Francisco. In order to stage the show we rented a venue from a company named <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/npuevents.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Non Plus Ultra<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yesterday we were informed by Non Plus Ultra that a reporter had reached out to ask about a sweep that had taken place in the early hours of last Thursday morning before our team arrived. This was the first time we had heard about Non Plus Ultra having coordinated an unsanctioned sweep outside of their building.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was not an action that we asked Non Plus Ultra to perform and is not something that we would ever ask them to do. Upon further investigation, we discovered that belongings and personal effects had been removed or discarded by a private company hired by Non Plus Ultra.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is absolutely unacceptable, and we\u2019re working to take immediate action. First, we will no longer be working with Non Plus Ultra at any of their venues in San Francisco for any TechCrunch event in the future.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, Non Plus Ultra has committed to working with local partners <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/chp-sf.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Community Housing Partnership<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/dishsf.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DISH<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to support the homeless community on 12th Street. They are also committing to set up a system to replace or, where possible, return property to the people who were unfairly targeted by this sweep. TechCrunch will ensure that Non Plus Ultra follows through on these commitments.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The city of San Francisco continues to struggle with a housing crisis and a large houseless population. Our neighbors who are living on the streets are suffering even more as they endure a pandemic and hazardous air quality from the California wildfires.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone deserves to be treated with compassion and humanity, regardless of how or where they live.

Though WeChat is the top messaging app by far in China, where it also serves as an essential conduit for payments and other services, the U.S. version of the app has relatively limited features. It is used by Chinese-Americans, and other members of the Chinese disapora in the U.S., to keep in touch with their family and other people in China. With other popular messaging apps, like Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, banned in China, WeChat is often the most direct communication channel available to them.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. government\u2019s filing (embedded below) was made as part of a request for a preliminary injunction against the executive order brought by the <a href=\"https:\/\/uswua.org\/\">U.S. WeChat Users Alliance<\/a>, a nonprofit organization initiated by attorneys who want to preserve access to WeChat for users in the U.S. A hearing is scheduled for Thursday.<\/p>\n<p>In it, attorneys from the Justice Department said the U.S. Commerce Department is continuing to review transactions and will clarify which ones are affected by September 20, but &#8220;we can provide assurances that [Secretary Ross] does not intend to take actions that would target persons or groups whose only connection to WeChat is their use or downloading of the app to convey personal or business information between users, or otherwise define the relevant transaction in such a way that would impose criminal or civil liability on such users.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But in a response (also embedded below), the U.S. WeChat Users Alliance said that the Department of Justice\u2019s filing instead demonstrates why a preliminary injunction is necessary. &#8220;Having first failed to articulate any actual national security concerns, the administration\u2019s latest &#8216;assurances&#8217; that users can keep using WeChat, and exchange their personal and business information, only further illustrates the hollowness and pre-textual nature of the Defendants&#8217; &#8216;national security rationales.&#8217; &#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. WeChat Users Alliance filed for the injunction on August 21. In an open letter published on its site, it said a complete ban of WeChat &#8220;will severely affect the lives and the work of millions of people in the U.S. They will have a difficult time talking to family relatives and friends back in China. Countless people or businesses who use WeChat to develop and contact customers will also suffer significant economic losses.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The group also believes that the executive order &#8220;violates many provisions of the U.S. Constitution,&#8221; and the Administrative Procedure Act.<\/p>\n<p><iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" src=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/embeds\/476351147\/content?start_page=1&view_mode&access_key=key-A2doQPZVJVE73jz3tG0l\"  data-auto-height=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"scribd_476351147\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t<div style=\"font-size:10px;text-align:center;width:100%\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/doc\/476351147\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">View this document on Scribd<\/a><\/div><\/p>\n<p><iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" src=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/embeds\/476351421\/content?start_page=1&view_mode&access_key=key-YWd1rsvNcakU0ZihHUna\"  data-auto-height=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"scribd_476351421\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t<div style=\"font-size:10px;text-align:center;width:100%\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/doc\/476351421\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">View this document on Scribd<\/a><\/div><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In a Wednesday filing in federal court, the United States government said that users who use or download WeChat &#8220;to convey personal or business information&#8221; will not be subject to penalties under President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order banning transactions with the Tencent-owned messaging app. Trump issued the executive order against WeChat on August 6, the [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4330449,"featured_media":2047954,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","carmot_uuid":"3bc69c8f-f95e-37a5-9d4f-b37ac04e09d8"},"categories":[449557102,13217,17396],"tags":[449557076,865614,108919,34932559,449558094,542665,5938293,1100288,32758280],"crunchbase_tag":[576607536],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/GettyImages-861781526.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/2ZMC4FY","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"featured":false,"subtitle":"","fundingRound":false,"seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","premiumContent":false,"premiumCutoffPercent":1,"tc_cb_mapping":[{"slug":"wechat","cb_name":"WeChat","cb_slug":"we-chat-organization","cb_link":"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/we-chat"},{"slug":"president-donald-trump","cb_name":"Donald J.

I hope so. I remember the day I first started using Twitter. My friend Gabe Rivera suggested it would be a good idea to sign on to the fledgling network. Basically it was a land grab \u2014 claim the real estate of my name. I most likely was aware of the fundamentals of the new service, but wary of actually making some sort of overt splash. Why would I want to, as the frame of the day went, announce what I was having for lunch?<\/p>\n<p>But I knew Gabe was right; I should get in line for the day it became clearer what good this was for. As Professor Irwin Corey would say Adam first said to Eve: stand back, I don\u2019t know how big this is going to get. So I did, and sat back for almost a year. Eventually some thread caught my eye, or my ego encouraged me to think somebody might be interested in what I was having for lunch. That led to a series of discoveries we all made about how this thing might work, if it could just not crash from its unscalable neo-scalable scripting language roots.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>One of the most interesting things to do in those early days was to misuse the network for creative purposes. If the logic of posting was to deliver meaningful content that would be of interest to larger audiences, we knew where that was headed. Celebrities, verified accounts, a triple A version of the big leagues of mainstream media. Logical maybe, but not what I was interested in. To the contrary, I relished the exact opposite, an experience where the result was something other than what we already had. One trick I had was to talk conversationally to the tiny audience of those I was pinging with their username.<\/p>\n<p>This may or may not have predated the @mention, but the intent was to send a message to someone who was notified of the attempt by a notification. Alternatively, following a small but targeted series of accounts created a stream of posts from people who shared some implicit common interests. Either way, eventually these @mention clouds became a rich source and object of breaking news, jokes and a stew of social energy. I enjoyed the occasional response, and would reply in place as though I was having a private chat. The theory went: if this annoyed people, they would unfollow me and be happier for it. Many did, and were.<\/p>\n<p>Skipping ahead to now, I still use Twitter in this way for the most part. I set my notification stream to display a subset of my follows, first around 50, then 100, now upwards of four or 500. It is annoyingly disruptive of the top of my screen; reading an e-book book is an intermittent experience at certain hours waiting for the stream to slow down when I\u2019m trying to read the first couple of lines of a page. But what I get is an almost subliminal collage of random stuff from a not-so-random group of what reminds me of a coffee house circle of friends in college days. The major news media breaks through repetitively when someone dies or succeeds, but also there are the mutterings of entrepreneurs and thought leaders, captains of industry who relish the direct channel, politicians of the digital underground, comedians, culture cowboys and cowgirls, right, left and centrist.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a living breathing thing, and it\u2019s different from everything else. Facebook is what you think of it, but I\u2019m sadly grateful for its function as the glue between family, friends and a shared personal history. Never mind that it&#8217;s impossible to find something once it flits by. I hate it yet appreciate it nonetheless. But Twitter is an imperfect pacemaker in my chest, beating with the pulse of the nation, the notifications starting in Europe, then the East Coast, finally the Valley and Hollywood before I get sidetracked by reality and over the hill to the next day.<\/p>\n<p>As <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/michael-markman-6388\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"michael-markman-6388\">Michael Markman <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> quotes Jerry Seinfeld on this Gillmor Gang episode, \u201cIt\u2019s never in the bag, and you\u2019re never out of the running.\u201d Yes, Trump dominates the service, and every other network as we careen toward the election.

But when the shouting\u2019s over and the ballots counted, Trump may or may not be left standing. Twitter surely will.

Matthews, founder and CEO of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.u-pwr.co\/\">Uncharted Power<\/a>, both have experience doing this. At TechCrunch Disrupt, they shed some light on their respective, yet somewhat similar, paths.<\/p>\n<p>PromisePay, formerly known as <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/promise\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"promise\">Promise, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> got its start as a bail reform startup that aimed to reduce the number of people held behind bars simply because they can&#8217;t pay bail. Now, it&#8217;s focused on helping people make payments for parking and traffic tickets, court fees and child support.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;We actually had this huge existential crisis,&#8221; Ellis-Lamkins said. &#8220;We at <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/promise\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"promise\">Promise <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> are focused on ending mass incarceration and on decreasing the number of people in jails. So we started to be very successful and we sold very well. And what we realized fundamentally is when we created efficiency, it made the systems more efficient at incarcerating people. It didn&#8217;t make them more efficient at what our wrong assumption had been, which is if the system is more efficient, it would decrease the number of people in the system. And so we made a decision that growth was not consistent with who we were as a company. So I went back to our investors, which is hard when you&#8217;re making money and said, this is not the path because I don&#8217;t think this is a long-term path.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>She told investors there are already people who sell their tech to law enforcement, but what Promise wants to do is liberate people. It became clear to her that she was selling to the wrong people when she was talking to a client who said the difference between them and her was that she cares about people in the criminal justice system and they don&#8217;t. Ellis-Lamkins told investors she was going to stop selling to prisons and jails, and offered to give investors their money back.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, she started looking at why people are ending up incarcerated.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And luckily, that spurred growth, but I&#8217;m just not going to be a company that grows on the backs of poor people and Black and brown people, because there is a better way,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But it was frightening in the moment to abandon a market in which we&#8217;re making money.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Thankfully, she said, not one of her investors had a problem with her decision.<\/p>\n<p><span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" data-sheets-userformat=\"{&quot;2&quot;:15043,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:1711393},&quot;9&quot;:0,&quot;10&quot;:1,&quot;12&quot;:0,&quot;14&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:13750995},&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;16&quot;:11}\">\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_1\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f627b7c5cfdcc2b0a2cddb2\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=1\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Matthews said she had a relatively similar experience with her company, Uncharted Power, which got its start as Uncharted Play. Her company&#8217;s first product was an energy-harnessing soccer ball that could power a lamp after just a few hours of playing with it. She later integrated that tech intro strollers to power cell phones.<\/p>\n<p>But after raising her Series A round for Uncharted Play, Matthews realized that her company needed to go all-in on infrastructure. She thought about the ultimate goal of her company, which is to get people the infrastructure they need in their lives. She just didn&#8217;t see a way of doing that with soccer balls.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;So we got good at making these things and pushing them and scaling them out, but when you have this balance of not just profit and impact but impact because you know that you&#8217;re a member of the group you&#8217;re trying to serve. For me, it was sitting down and saying &#8216;is this actually solving the problem even if it&#8217;s successful?&#8217; &#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Matthews said she realized it wasn&#8217;t. So that meant walking away from the products that were bringing in millions and had 64% gross profit margins, Matthews said.<\/p>\n<p>But it all paid off. Last year, Uncharted Power raised additional funding from an investor that validated her thesis for the future of power infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;That moment was huge for us,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>Matthews and Ellis-Lamkins also had some other gems worth sharing about imposter syndrome and measuring success. Here are some more highlights from the conversation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>On imposter syndrome and representation\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ellis-Lamkins:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>It feels like tech has failed so significantly in investing in people they don&#8217;t know and missed out in growing companies because of that. So I think our obligation is to help make sure that we are not the only ones.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Matthews:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s not imposter syndrome, it&#8217;s representation syndrome because I feel the exact same way. When we raised our Series A, the immediate thing I thought was, &#8216;Oh, man. I can not lose these people&#8217;s money.&#8217; This is huge and if we don&#8217;t work, it&#8217;s not even about us, it&#8217;s about every other person who looks like me.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>On measuring success<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ellis-Lamkins:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I think part of what we should measure is how does technology improve our society in general, a measurement of success. I do think that if we measure success, it should not just be, I could make a billion dollars or have a company that is valued at a billion dollars if the consequences are greater than the actual benefit and so I think that&#8217;s really important.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Matthews:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Let&#8217;s get rid of the term &#8220;social enterprise.&#8221; It&#8217;s bullshit. Enterprise is an enterprise. A problem&#8217;s a problem. Let&#8217;s create a value system based on the problems. There are some problems that are more important than others.

Obviously, the onset of COVID-19 curtailed travel, but they continued talking to startups through video calls and emails.<\/p>\n<p>Lightspeed focuses on early-stage investments and has already invested in some of the most prolific startups in Southeast Asia, including Grab. Its other portfolio companies in the region are Indonesian startups Chilibeli, a social commerce platform, B2B wholesale marketplace Ula and e-commerce logistics platform Shipper, as well as Singaporean software developer NextBillion.AI.<\/p>\n<p>Some of Lightspeed\u2019s investments in other countries have also taken a keen interest in Southeast Asia as a key market for global expansion, including Indian startups OYO Rooms, Darwinbox and Yellow Messenger.<\/p>\n<p>Having regional operations will allow Lightspeed to work more closely with its portfolio companies and make deeper connections with entrepreneurs, Bhushan said.<\/p>\n<p>He added that the pandemic has prompted the rapid adoption of technologies, including platforms that help small businesses digitize their operations or sell online, supply chain solutions and remote working or online education-related services.<\/p>\n<p>In sectors like fintech or logistics, there is also a lot of opportunity in several Southeast Asian countries to build transformative platforms and services. For example, Bhushan said, Shipper is focused on solving some of the biggest supply chain and logistics challenges facing e-commerce sellers in Indonesia, while Grab has made digital payments and other financial services like insurance easier to access.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The big opportunity in most emerging markets, and this applies to most of the markets in Southeast Asia, is that we generally find that a lot of the fundamental infrastructure is broken, and founders can leverage technology to fill those gaps,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What excites us are founders who are solving those infrastructural problems, and a lot of our investments are to that effect.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Lightspeed Venture Partners announced the launch of its Southeast Asia operations today.

href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/delane-parnell\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"delane-parnell\">Delane Parnell <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> said in an interview at Disrupt 2020 this week. With around 20,000 high schools signed up currently and nearly a hundred million dollars in the bank to grow with, it&#8217;s not a totally unrealistic statement.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The company collects $64 per player per semi-yearly season, which starts to add up real quick when you have Counter-Strike teams of a dozen people with alternates, or competing League teams at the same school \u2014 multiplied by 20,000, of course. A bit of napkin math suggests income from existing customers is easily in the tens of millions.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"lZqhzilsCC\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/09\/18\/playvs-picks-up-50-million-series-c-to-build-out-high-school-esports\/\">PlayVS picks up $50 million Series C to build out high school esports<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;PlayVS picks up $50 million Series C to build out high school esports&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/09\/18\/playvs-picks-up-50-million-series-c-to-build-out-high-school-esports\/embed\/#?secret=lZqhzilsCC\" data-secret=\"lZqhzilsCC\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Parnell offered the following metaphor to explain what the company aspired to.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Imagine if there was one basketball court, and every kid who ever wanted to play basketball, whether it&#8217;s on behalf of their school, or pick-up, or some sort of tournament, <em>that&#8217;s<\/em> the court that they had to play on,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re building.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Sure, it sounds a little bit like a monopoly on hoops, but the problem right now is that there really isn&#8217;t a shared court at all. Esports is wildly disorganized at that level, if it&#8217;s organized at all (and let&#8217;s be honest, even at the pro level it&#8217;s a bit of a jumble). PlayVS wants to provide the connective tissue so that there&#8217;s one place that both players and administrators go when it comes to inter-school competitive gaming.<\/p>\n<p>Parnell explained that the last year has been about learning the ropes and establishing a presence in the also quite confusing world of state school systems.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We certainly built the base of the business on the partnership with the NFHS \u2014 essentially the NCAA of high schools, they govern and write the rules for our high school sports,&#8221; he said. But then individual relationships need to be established with districts, financial programs, state leaders and of course the game publishers themselves, which are understandably eager to connect with the younger generation of gamers.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f612e83d7e19332996787c9\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n<p>So far schools in 23 states have signed up, and Parnell said they&#8217;re on track to get every state in the union on board by 2022.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Those are partnerships that take a little time to form. It also takes additional time to build the technology that actually enables online esports, which most people think exists today, but it actually doesn&#8217;t,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So we&#8217;ve started to invest very deeply into hiring a team to build our product. We have a ton of capital in the bank and we intend to use that very wisely.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The product build-out is more than buying servers \u2014 it&#8217;s attempting to create parity with the tools available in the context of sports like football and basketball.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s products and services that we can bake in, things like recruiting, scouting, proven technology, highlights&#8230; these are things that would normally exist from independent companies within traditional sports,&#8221; he said. &#8220;One company does one thing, a thousand companies do ancillary things that make the sports experience better for every stakeholder, a parent, a coach, a player, etc. We&#8217;re going to be able to do all of those things within the PlayVS ecosystem, because we&#8217;re the league operator and the sole holder of that data. We will effectively have complete control of what that experience looks like and all of the revenue models associated with that.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>For comparison he suggested fantasy sports, now a huge industry but not one dominated by a single entity. &#8220;If there was one group, like CBS for example, that could have aggregated all that behavior, that&#8217;d be a $40-50 billion a year company. But they couldn&#8217;t get in with, you know, the NFL, the NBA, to give them exclusive rights to be the only fantasy provider on the market,&#8221; Parnell explained. &#8220;Game publishers are willing to do that with us, they&#8217;re willing to integrate with our product because they know we can execute. So I think that&#8217;s a big opportunity. And one that could be worth hundreds of billions of dollars.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>PlayVS won&#8217;t be expanding into pro leagues, he confirmed, saying that the high school and college level work is as much as they can handle right now. But they&#8217;re overwhelmed in the best way.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s almost as if the NBA existed for four years, and then they went back and said hey, we need to build high school basketball, college basketball, etc.,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Obviously there&#8217;s a lot of catching up to do.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Millions of high school kids play online multiplayer games, but they seldom have crosstown rivals in Fortnite or Valorant.

Those updates address two of JAWS&#8217; challenges &#8212; the complexity of the available keyboard command set that intimidates some users and \u201calt tags\u201d on images that don\u2019t always adequately describe the image.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe upcoming versions of JAWS, ZoomText, and Fusion use natural language processing to allow many screen reader commands to be performed verbally,&#8221; says Gordon. \u201cYou probably wouldn\u2019t want to speak every command, but for the less common ones Voice assist offers a way to minimize the key combinations that you need to learn.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cBroadly speaking, we\u2019re looking to make it easier for people to use a smaller command set to work efficiently. This fundamentally means making our products smarter, and being able to anticipate what a user wants and needs based on their prior actions. Getting there is an imprecise process and we\u2019ll continue to rely on user feedback to help guide us towards what works best.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next generation of screen readers will take advantage of AI, among other technologies, and that will be a major topic at <a href=\"https:\/\/sighttechglobal.com\/\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/sighttechglobal.com\/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1600377075573000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEBxgRfKPSo7wyPQNlCs9aBk-Kx1w\">Sight Tech Global<\/a> on December 2-3. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/sight-tech-global-tickets-117352240711\">Get your free pass now<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Sight Tech Global <a href=\"https:\/\/sighttechglobal.com\/sponsorship-opportunities\/\">welcomes sponsors<\/a>.

The goal, he told me, is to create an entire suite of &#8220;back office&#8221; tools for experts and influencers, but the company is starting out by offering an easy way to host one-on-one video sessions with fans and &#8220;knowledge seekers.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;People who are influencers on social media and on YouTube, they don\u2019t control that customer,&#8221; Mathieu said. &#8220;It\u2019s a YouTube customer, so if you&#8217;re going to monetize, it&#8217;s through a slice of YouTube ad revenue.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>So Prox is designed to help those experts make money more directly from anyone who wants to connect with them, and to understand that audience.

It looks fairly straightforward for someone to try to schedule a meeting with a pro and then jump into a video call. The knowledge seeker controls the meeting agenda, but the pro also gets to screen appointments and topics in advance, and they also set their own rates for how much their time is worth. (Head of Product Matt Coalson said some pros are able to charge $150 for a 15-minute call.)<\/p>\n<p>Afterwards, both the knowledge seeker and the pro can rate the experience, and they can schedule follow-up calls if it went well. Prox also provides analytics for pros around the kinds of feedback they&#8217;re getting and the most commonly asked questions.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve previously <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/11\/superpeer\/\">written about Superpeer<\/a>, another startup helping influencers and experts make money from one-on-one calls, but when I brought it up, Mathieu suggested that the competitive landscape is much broader, with influencers having access to a range of tools for marketing and monetization.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The way we position ourselves compared to the competition is, we\u2019re really purpose-built for providing value to that pro,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just about that platform \u2014 video, audio, ratings, that has significant value, but our goal is to provide the layer above that, to give the pro, in essence, a road map: If you\u2019re on Prox and you do these two or three things, you&#8217;ll make 10x more money.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"fYGfHTcqL7\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/04\/venture-capitalists-like-and-subscribe-to-influencers\/\">Venture capitalists \u2018like and subscribe\u2019 to influencers<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Venture capitalists \u2018like and subscribe\u2019 to influencers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/04\/venture-capitalists-like-and-subscribe-to-influencers\/embed\/#?secret=fYGfHTcqL7\" data-secret=\"fYGfHTcqL7\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you&#8217;ve got a large online following, as well as knowledge that might be valuable to that audience, Prox is a startup currently in beta testing that&#8217;s building tools to help you make money.

for Koller, whose work now spans the development of treatments for potential neurological diseases and a nearer-term research and development effort on hepatitis with Gilead

the in vitro experiments that are done on living samples in labs and the in silico experiments that are done on the computer.<\/p>\n<p>By synthesizing these two disciplines, Koller&#8217;s company flips the process of drug discovery on its head, as the company is designed to sift through massive amounts of data to search for patterns in the expression of certain conditions. Once those patterns are determined, the company can examine the pathways or mechanisms associated with that expression to determine targets for potential therapies.<\/p>\n<p>Then Insitro will pursue the development of novel molecules that can be used to intervene and either reverse or stop the progression of an illness by stopping the biological mechanisms associated with it.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f6275ad2be1612af54425e5\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We now have massive amounts of data that is truly relevant to human disease,&#8221; Koller said. &#8220;Machine learning has given us a bunch of tools to really make sense of data.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The company can identify new patient segments, new interventions new drugs that may modulate the expression of those conditions. &#8220;We view ourselves as being on the first phase of a very long journey using machine learning,&#8221; said Koller.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Take the company&#8217;s work on hepatitis in conjunction with Gilead. There, Koller and her team were able to take a small, high-quality data set from Gilead&#8217;s trials and identify how a disease progressed by looking at the patient data from different points in time. Looking at the progression allowed the company to identify drivers that facilitated the progression of fibrosis that causes tissue damage. Now the company is using those targets as a starting point to find modifiers that could slow down the progression of the disease.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>It comes down to using computers to understand the biology, new biotechnology to model that biology in a Petri dish and, from the different models, determine the interventions that will make a difference, Koller said.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;What we\u2019re trying to do is so different and so out of alignment with how these [pharmaceutical] companies do their work,&#8221; Koller said. &#8220;It&#8217;s t<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rying to shift the trajectory of these companies of hundreds or thousands of people and shift the culture to a tech culture that is going to be really a challenge.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the main reason Koller launched her own company rather than joining a big pharma play, and it&#8217;s a classic example of the innovator&#8217;s dilemma and the disruptive power of technology laid out in the theories of Clayton Christensen that give the Disrupt conference its name.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;[It&#8217;s] the notion of the innovator\u2019s dilemma and coming in with a mindset that says we\u2019re going to do this a completely different way,&#8221; said Koller. &#8220;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The drug discovery effort is becoming increasingly expensive and increasingly prone to failure and if we do this in a different way will it enable us to generate better outcomes.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Working at the intersection of biology and computing may be the most exciting new spot for technologists at the moment.

Today&#8217;s big event answered some of the lingering questions about the next-generation console. The company waited until the bitter end for the most important details. The PS5 will arrive in select markets on November 12 for $500, while the Digital Edition (sans-optical drive) runs $400.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/pb3VFdtptyE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>On that date, the console will be available in North America, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea. The rest of the world will get their hands on the console a week later, on November 19. The pricing keeps the PS5 plenty competitive with the new Xboxes. The Series X hits the same price point, while the lower-end Series S runs $299. Microsoft&#8217;s console launches a full two days earlier than Sony&#8217;s, so that should be fun.<\/p>\n<p>Sony&#8217;s pricing was the source of a good deal of speculation and hand-wringing in recent months. But while Microsoft got the first salvo, the PS5 is going to be right there along with it &#8212; a fact that should be the source of a good deal of concern for Redmond&#8217;s gaming team. Pricing is going to be a big factor in decision making. While game spending has ballooned during the COVID-19 shutdown, many folks are cautious about pulling the trigger on big-ticket items amid such an uncertain economic slow down.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/yr6PtdY0i7M?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As ever, the event leaned very heavily toward trailers and gameplay demos, showcasing the titles the PS5 will have on offer. Things kicked off with some major franchise blockbusters, including Final Fantasy XVI and the best look yet at Spider-Man: Miles Morales, which featured an extremely compelling bridge battle.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/T03PxxuCfDA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Spider-Man expansion is due this holiday, to coincide with the console\u2019s launch.

Hogwarts Legacy looks like an epic time in the Wizarding World.

A non-franchise game? Yes, it\u2019s Bethesda\u2019s Deathloop. The time-looping adventure game is due out in mid-2021. The sufficiently creepy trailer for zombie favorite Resident Evil: Village asked more questions than it answered. The title is also slated for next year.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Other titles include Devil May Cry 5 Special Edition (due at launch), Oddworld: Soulstorm and the Demon Souls remaster.

joined us at TechCrunch Disrupt today, she was much more focused on her work as an investor.<\/p>\n<p>Washington traced much of her interest in technology to the premiere of &#8220;Scandal&#8221; in 2012. It had, she said, been &#8220;almost 40 years since a Black woman was the lead on a network drama,&#8221; which meant that the pressure was high \u2014 and that &#8220;Scandal&#8221; was considered a &#8220;bubble show,&#8221; with the network &#8220;taking a big risk by putting a Black woman in the lead.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So Washington said she drew on her <a href=\"https:\/\/www.politico.com\/story\/2013\/07\/50-politicos-to-watch-kerry-washington-094191\">experience as a volunteer<\/a> with Barack Obama&#8217;s presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2012, and particularly her work with social media organizing, to try to rally support.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;From the very beginning of that show, we leveraged the power of technology to support the show in ways that traditional media wasn&#8217;t supporting us \u2014 or was waiting to see what the public response would be,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Really, I think the Twitter-verse allowed us to have a second season, and then we kind of took off from there.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>As for how that led to investing her own money into startups, Washington suggested that she wanted to be more involved.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When it comes to my engagement with any sort of any creative relationship that I&#8217;m in, I&#8217;m not really good at having a seat at the table without a voice,&#8221; she said.

In the wake of these criticisms, CEO Audrey Gelman departed this summer.<\/p>\n<p>When asked about her response to the controversy, Washington said, &#8220;As somebody who\u2019s an investor, as a woman of color, it\u2019s important to me that there is increased transparency and also accountability.&#8221; She said that over the past few months, her role as an investor has been &#8220;really just supporting leadership in this transition,&#8221; while also expressing a &#8220;deep desire&#8221; for that transparency and accountability.<\/p>\n<p>Other investments include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.community.com\">Community<\/a>, which allows celebrities to manage text message conversations with fans. (Washington promised that if you text her, she will really be the one who responds\u00a0\u2014 though she also asked for patience, since she&#8217;s texting with &#8220;thousands and thousands of people.&#8221;) There&#8217;s also direct-to-consumer teeth-straightening startup <a href=\"https:\/\/www.byteme.com\">Byte<\/a>, which Washington said she uses herself.<\/p>\n<p>As for her dream startup, Washington said she has a not-yet-announced investment in a direct-to-consumer fashion startup, &#8220;and it feels really dreamy at the moment.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Again, these have all been personal investments so far.
