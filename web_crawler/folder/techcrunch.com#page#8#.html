The app returned to the store eight hours later, but the controversy and acrimony Google has stirred up in the country will linger for years.<\/p>\n<p>TechCrunch reported on Friday that Google pulled <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/paytm\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"paytm\">Paytm <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> app from its app store after a repeat pattern of violations of Google Play Store guidelines by the Indian firm.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Paytm, which is locked in a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/03\/google-and-walmarts-phonepe-establish-dominance-in-indias-mobile-payments-market-as-whatsapp-pay-struggles-to-launch\/\">battle against Google to win India\u2019s payments market<\/a>, has been frustrated at Google\u2019s policies &#8212; which it argues gives Google an unfair advantage &#8212; for several past quarters over how the Android-maker is limiting its marketing campaigns to acquire new users, sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>The explanation provided by Google to Paytm for why it pulled the Indian firm\u2019s app this week from its app store is the latest attempt by the company to thwart the Noida-headquartered firm\u2019s ability to acquire new users, Paytm executives said.<\/p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.paytm.com\/the-story-behind-paytm-apps-de-listing-from-google-play-store-42b3b6f54da0\">blog post<\/a> Paytm posted Sunday evening (local India time), the Indian firm said Google took issue with the company for giving customers cashbacks and scratch cards for initiating transactions over UPI, a government-backed payments infrastructure in India that has become the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/01\/upi-india-growth-startups-business-model\/\">most popular way for people to exchange money digitally in the country.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Paytm said it rolled out this new version of scratch cards that are linked to cricket on September 11. Users collected these cricket-themed stickers for sending money to others, or making transactions such as topping up credit on their phone or paying their broadband or electricity bill.<\/p>\n<p>In a statement on Sunday evening, a Google spokesperson said, \u201coffering cashbacks and vouchers alone do not constitute a violation of our Google Play gambling policies\u201d and that Play Store \u201cpolicies are applied and enforced on all developers consistently.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But it\u2019s arguably anything but consistent.<\/p>\n<p>On September 18, Google told Paytm that it had pulled its app for not complying with Play Store\u2019s \u201cgambling policy\u201d as it offered games with \u201cloyalty points.\u201d Paytm said that Google had not expressed any concerns over Paytm\u2019s new marketing campaign prior to its notice on Friday, in which it revealed that Paytm app had been temporarily removed from the Play Store.<\/p>\n<p>But Google itself is running a similar campaign linked to cricket in India, Paytm argues. (Why cricket? Cricket is immensely popular in India and one of the biggest cricket tournaments globally, Indian Premier League, kicked off its latest season on Saturday.)<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2049284\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2049284\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2049284 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"286\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg 3284w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=150,42 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=300,84 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=768,214 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=680,190 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=1536,428 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=2048,571 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=50,14 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2049284\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cricket-themed cashback offered by Paytm (left) and Google Pay (right) in India<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Google Play Store in India has long prohibited apps that promote gambling such as betting on sporting events, and Google has raised concerns about Paytm&#8217;s marquee app promoting Paytm First Games, a fantasy sports app run by Paytm, in the past.<\/p>\n<p>Paytm executives argued that <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/phonepe\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"phonepe\">PhonePe, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> a Walmart-owned payments app in India, also promoted Dream11, the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/indian-fantasy-sports-app-dream11s-parent-firm-raises-225m-at-over-2-5b-valuation\/\">most popular fantasy sports app in the country<\/a>, and got away without any action.<\/p>\n<p>Google also permits fantasy sports app operators &#8212; including Paytm &#8212; to advertise on Search in India.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-theme=\"light\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Where is Google hypocritical?

The removal of Paytm app was only on the grounds of Paytm offering cricket-themed cashback, he claimed. \u201cGoogle is not allowing us to acquire new customers right now. That\u2019s all what this is,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s payments app, Google Pay, competes with Paytm in India. In fact, Google Pay is the largest payments app for peer-to-peer transaction between users in India and holds the largest market share in UPI.<\/p>\n<p>Without identifying any names, Sharma, the poster child of Indian startup ecosystem, claimed that many founders in India have just accepted that it is Google that has the final say on any matter in India &#8212; and not the country\u2019s regulatory agencies.<\/p>\n<p>For Google, which reaches more users than any other company in India and whose Android operating system commands 99% of the local smartphone market, this kind of accusation is exactly what it needs to avoid in the country. The Silicon Valley search and advertising giant has launched a charm offensive in India, including a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/13\/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india\/\">recently commitment to invest $10 billion<\/a> &#8212;\u00a0more than any other American or Chinese technology firm.<\/p>\n<p>The timing for Google&#8217;s parent company, Alphabet, couldn&#8217;t be worse. Google is currently the <a href=\"https:\/\/in.reuters.com\/article\/us-india-google-antitrust-exclusive\/exclusive-google-faces-antitrust-case-in-india-over-payments-app-sources-idUKKBN2331G3\">subject of an antitrust complaint<\/a> in India over an allegation that it has abused its market position to unfairly promote its mobile payments app in the country; and in the U.S., Congress has intimidated that it may pursue antitrust regulatory action against Alphabet and Apple over app store concerns.<\/p>\n<p>In India, Google&#8217;s moves could have a devastating impact on businesses and everyday consumers.<\/p>\n<p>Paytm is not just a payments app. It is also a fully licensed digital bank. And just an eight-hour of absence from the Play Store created a panic among a portion of its users. A source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that Paytm saw several people withdraw their fixed deposit in Paytm Payments Bank on Friday.<\/p>\n<p>Anecdotally, TechCrunch heard of instances where vendors who previously preferred Paytm for accepting money digitally asked their customers to use a different payments method as they had heard that Paytm was \u201cbanned\u201d in India.<\/p>\n<p>Sharma said Google&#8217;s monopoly on Indian app ecosystem is of a magnitude unparalleled elsewhere in the world.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf paying someone and getting a cashback is gambling, then the same rule should be applied to everyone,\u201d said Sharma. \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful that we are standing here at the cusp of an internet revolution in India and we are being sanctioned by companies that are not governed by the law of this country.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If this sentiment gained traction in India it could create challenges for Google&#8217;s future in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. is forcing a Chinese company to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/19\/tiktok-deal-terms\/\">sell stakes to local firms to continue operations in the country<\/a>. In a recent episode of Dithering podcast, Ben Thompson cautioned that Trump administration\u2019s move &#8212; which some have argued is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/08\/18\/opinion\/tiktok-wechat-ban-trump.html\">a long due tit for tat against Chinese companies<\/a> (as China has long prevented U.S. firms from meaningfully operating in the world&#8217;s largest \u00a0internet market) &#8212;\u00a0might encourage\u00a0other open markets to do to American firms what it is doing to TikTok.<\/p>\n<p>Several U.S. tech executives share these concerns.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The problem with this TikTok deal is that the US is the largest player in tech globally.

One was innovative, one made clones. One was a free market while the other demanded payments to a political party and its leadership, a corrupt wealth generating scam that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/business\/global\/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html\">by some estimates<\/a> has netted top leaders billions of dollars. One kept the talent borders porous acting as a magnet for the world\u2019s top brains while the other interviewed you in a backroom at the airport before imprisoning you on sedition charges (okay, that might have been both).<\/p>\n<p>The comparison was always facile yes, but it was easy and at least directionally accurate if failing on the specifics.<\/p>\n<p>Now though, the country that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2019\/04\/lithium-ion-batteries-amazon-are-exploding\/587005\/\">exported exploding batteries<\/a> is pioneering quantum computing, while the country that pioneered the internet <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/03\/made-in-america-is-on-government-life-support-and-the-prognosis-isnt-good\/\">now builds planes that fall out of the sky<\/a> (and good news, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/boeing-flags-additional-787-production-problem-11599577936\">we\u2019ve identified even more planes<\/a> that might fall out of the sky at an airport near you!)<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tiktok\">TikTok\u2019s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> success is many things, but it is quite frankly just an embarrassment for the United States. There are thousands of entrepreneurs and hundreds of venture capitalists swarming Silicon Valley and the other American innovation hubs looking for the next great social app or building it themselves. But the power law of user growth and investor returns happens to reside in Haidian, Beijing. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/bytedance\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"bytedance\">ByteDance <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> through its local apps in China and overseas apps like TikTok <i>is<\/i> the consumer investor return of the past decade (there\u2019s a reason why all the IPOs this seasons are enterprise SaaS).<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a win that you can\u2019t chalk up just to industrial policy. Unlike in semiconductors or other capital-intensive industries where Beijing can offer billions in incentives to spur development, ByteDance builds apps. It distributes them on app stores across the world. It has exactly the same tools available to it that every entrepreneur with an Apple Developer account has access to. There is no <a href=\"https:\/\/www.csis.org\/analysis\/made-china-2025\">Made in China 2025<\/a> plan to build and popularize a consumer app like TikTok (you literally can\u2019t plan for consumer success like that). Instead, it\u2019s a well-executed product that\u2019s addictive to hundreds of millions of people.<\/p>\n<p>So much as China protected its industry from overseas competitors like Google and Amazon through market-entry barriers, America is now protecting its entrenched incumbents from overseas competitors like TikTok. We\u2019re demanding joint ventures and local cloud data sovereignty just as the Communist Party has demanded for years.<\/p>\n<p>Hell, we\u2019re apparently demanding a $5 billion tax payment from ByteDance, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-09-20\/trump-wants-5-billion-from-tiktok-deal-for-new-history-project\">which the president says will fund patriotic education for youth<\/a>. The president says a lot of things of course, but at least the $5 billion price point has been confirmed by Oracle in its press release over night (what the tax revenue will <i>actually<\/i> be used for is anyone\u2019s guess). If you followed the recent Hong Kong protests for a long time, you will remember that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-hongkong-patriotism\/hong-kong-frets-over-china-model-patriotic-education-idUSBRE86A09L20120711\">patriotic youth education<\/a> was some of the original tinder for those demonstrations back in 2012. What comes around, goes around, I guess.<\/p>\n<p>Development economists like to talk about \u201ccatch-up\u201d strategies, tactics that countries can take to avoid the middle income trap and cut the gap between the West and the rest. But what we need now are developed economists to explain America\u2019s \u201cfall behind\u201d strategy. Because we are falling behind, in pretty much everything.<\/p>\n<p>As the TikTok process and the earlier Huawei imbroglio show, America is no longer on the leading edge of technology in many key strategic markets. Mainland Chinese companies are globally winning in areas as diverse as 5G and social networks, and without direct government intervention to kill that innovation, American and European tech purveyors would have lost those markets entirely (and even <i>with<\/i> those interventions, they may still lose them). In Taiwan, TSMC has come from behind Intel to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/051b2c80-d53b-410e-8e80-f433d25a82dd\">take a year or two lead<\/a> in the fabrication of the most advanced semiconductors.<\/p>\n<p>I mean, we can\u2019t even pilfer Chinese history and mythology and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/21428088\/mulan-review-disney-live-action-remake\">turn it into a decent god damn film<\/a> these days.<\/p>\n<p>And the fall-behind strategy continues. Immigration restrictions from an administration hell-bent on destroying the single greatest source of American innovation, coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic, have fused into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/international-student-enrollment-trump-covid19-5caad69c-f6d4-4b79-bfb4-7b6ed038bc5b.html\">the largest single drop in international student migration in American history<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Why does that matter? In the U.S. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.insidehighered.com\/quicktakes\/2017\/10\/11\/foreign-students-and-graduate-stem-enrollment\">according to relatively recent data<\/a>, 81% of electrical engineering grad students are international, 79% in computer science are, and in most engineering and technical fields, the number hovers above a majority.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s great to believe the fantasy that if only these international grad students would stay home, then \u201creal\u201d Americans would somehow take these slots. But what\u2019s true of the strawberry pickers and food service workers is also true for EE grad students: proverbial \u201cAmericans\u201d don\u2019t want these jobs. They are hard jobs, thankless jobs, and require a ridiculous tenacity that American workers and students by and large don\u2019t have. These industries have huge contingents of foreign workers precisely because no one domestic wants to take these roles.<\/p>\n<p>So goes the talent, so goes the innovation. Without this wellspring of brainpower lodging itself in America\u2019s top innovation hubs, where exactly do we think it will go? That former aspiring Stanford or MIT computer scientist with ideas in his or her brain isn\u2019t just going to sit by the window gazing at the horizon waiting for the moment when they can enter the gilded halls of the U.S. of A. It\u2019s the internet era, and they are just going to get started on their dreams wherever they are, using whatever tools and resources they have available to them.<\/p>\n<p>All you have to do is look at the recent YC batches and realize that the future cohorts of great startups are going to increasingly come from outside the continental 48. Dozens of smart, brilliant entrepreneurs aren\u2019t even trying to migrate, instead rightfully seeing their home markets as more open to innovation and technological progress than the vaunted superpower. The frontier is closed here, and it has moved elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>So what are we left with here in the U.S. and increasingly Europe? A narrow-minded policy of blocking external tech innovation to ensure that our sclerotic and entrenched incumbents don\u2019t have to compete with the best in the world. If that isn\u2019t a recipe for economic disaster, I don\u2019t know what is.<\/p>\n<p>But hey: at least the youth will be patriotic.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It used to be \u201ceasy\u201d to tell the American and Chinese economies apart.

developers with an 85\/15 split<\/a> on revenue from customers that remain subscribed for more than a year \u2014 subscription monetization and retention has felt like the Holy Grail for app developers. So much so that <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/googleplay\/android-developer\/answer\/112622?hl=en\">Google quickly followed suit<\/a>\u00a0in what appeared to be an example of healthy competition for developers in the mobile OS duopoly.<\/p>\n<p>But how does that split actually work out for most apps? Turns out, the 85\/15 split \u2014 which Apple is keen to mention anytime developers complain about the App Store rev share \u2014 doesn\u2019t have a meaningful impact for most developers. Because churn.<\/p>\n<p>No matter how great an app is, subscribers are going to churn. Sometimes it\u2019s because of a credit card expiring or some other billing issue. And sometimes it\u2019s more of a pause, and the user comes back after a few months. But the majority of churn comes from subscribers who, for whatever reason, decide that the app just isn\u2019t worth paying for anymore. If a subscriber churns before the one-year mark, the developer never sees that 85% split. And even if the user resubscribes, Apple and Google reset the clock if a subscription has lapsed for more than 60 days. Rather convenient\u2026 for Apple and Google.<\/p>\n<p>Top mobile apps like Netflix and Spotify report churn rates in the low single digits, but they are the outliers. According to our data, the median churn rate for subscription apps is around\u00a013% for monthly subscriptions\u00a0and around 50% for annual. Monthly subscription churn is generally a bit higher in the first few months, then it tapers off. But an average churn of 13% leaves just 20% of subscribers crossing that magical 85\/15 threshold.<\/p>\n<p>In practice, what this means is that, for all the hype around the 85\/15 split, very few developers are going to see a meaningful increase in revenue:<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2048964\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img

is a video game focused on education founded by Shadow founder"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Meet <a href=\"https:\/\/powerz.tech\">PowerZ<\/a>, a new French startup founded by Emmanuel Freund, the founder of popular cloud gaming service <a href=\"https:\/\/shadow.tech\">Shadow<\/a>, as well as former Shadow employees. The company wants to develop a video game that is as engaging as Fortnite, but with a focus on education. It is both an edtech startup and a video game studio.<\/p>\n<p>PowerZ has raised a $3.5 million (\u20ac3 million) seed round from Educapital, Hachette Livre and various business angels, such as Pierre Kosciusko-Morizet, Micha\u00ebl Benabou and Octave Klaba.<\/p>\n<p>After turning Shadow into one of the most valuable French startups, Freund stepped back and took some time to think about his second act. He spent some time with his two children aged 5 and 8 years old.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\u201cI realized that code-learning tools for children are very lacking. So I turned to math because you don\u2019t need any support material. There are 40,000 apps but they all look like holiday workbooks,\u201d Freund told me.<\/p>\n<p>From his experience, most education apps are focused on one knowledge area in particular and are somewhat basic. According to him, education hasn\u2019t changed that much in the past 100 years. When you walk into a classroom, it still looks like a classroom.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, when you see a kid playing on Fortnite or Minecraft, chances are they\u2019re hooked. You tell them to come for dinner and they ask you for five more minutes of playtime.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if we could build a sort of Ready Player One for education. An open world in which a child could learn new things,\u201d Freund said.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what you can expect from PowerZ. First, it\u2019s not going to focus on one area in particular. You can learn history, geography, math, but also botanical knowledge, astronomy and poetry.<\/p>\n<p>Second, content isn\u2019t going to be gamified to motivate you to learn more to do more in the game. You\u2019ll be able to unlock some customizations but PowerZ is taking it easy with gamification.<\/p>\n<p>Third, the game will evolve depending on what you\u2019re doing. Some children will be better at math, others will be better at grammar. Some children like to learn new things in short sessions, others can remain focused for a while. This way, parents can get reports on what their children have been doing.<\/p>\n<p>PowerZ wants to develop its game with a community of parents, teachers and children. There will be an alpha test in 2021, first in France and then in English-speaking countries. It\u2019s still the early days of the company, but it\u2019s going to be interesting to see how it evolves over time.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2047539\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2047539\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2047539\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Founders.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Founders.jpg 4000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Founders.jpg?resize=150,66 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Founders.jpg?resize=300,133 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Founders.jpg?resize=768,340 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Founders.jpg?resize=680,301 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Founders.jpg?resize=1536,679 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Founders.jpg?resize=2048,906 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Founders.jpg?resize=50,22 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2047539\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> PowerZ<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Meet PowerZ, a new French startup founded by Emmanuel Freund, the founder of popular cloud gaming service Shadow, as well as former Shadow employees.

Just a few weeks after that post, Unity, JFrog, Asana, Snowflake and Sumo Logic <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/25\/unity-jfrog-asana-snowflake-and-sumo-logic-file-for-ipos-in-rapid-fire-fashion\/\">all filed to go public<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Today we&#8217;re seeing some data from those debuts, most notably <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/jfrog-and-snowflakes-aggressive-ipo-pricing-point-to-strong-demand-for-cloud-shares\/\">the incredibly strong pricing runs from both JFrog and Snowflake<\/a>. But even more, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/snowflake-computing\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"snowflake-computing\">Snowflake <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> just opened at either $245 or $269.50, depending on your data source. Regardless, the company&#8217;s stock is currently worth $276.2 per share, some 130% higher than its IPO price. Which, as <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/jfrog-and-snowflakes-aggressive-ipo-pricing-point-to-strong-demand-for-cloud-shares\/\">we noted earlier<\/a>, was already pretty high, given the company&#8217;s most recent revenue results.<\/p>\n<p>Adding to the Snowflake example, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/jfrog-ltd\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"jfrog-ltd\">JFrog <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> opened worth around $71.30 today, sharply higher than its <em>above-an-already<\/em><em>-raised-range <\/em>IPO price of $44. That&#8217;s wild! JFrog is now worth around $7 billion, despite having posted revenue in its last quarter of just $36.4 million.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The message from today&#8217;s debuts appears to be that valuations are unmoored from old rules &#8212; for the moment, that is &#8212; and thus companies that can post 100% growth or greater have little in the way of a cap on their upper limit.<\/p>\n<p><em>Our takeaway: Go public now.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Adding to the good news is that some of the valuations we&#8217;ve understood less than others are holding up. First-day pop-and-drop today&#8217;s market isn&#8217;t. For example, Lemonade is still up about 50% from its IPO price, and OneMedical is up 100% from its own. So, software valuations are so wild that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/28\/tech-valuations-vs-tech-enabled-valuations-2020-ipo-edition\/\">even software-adjacent companies are benefiting<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>This is excellent news for a great number of unicorns. The good times are still here, amazingly, while the economy is still pretty bad and the election looms. All those old rules about having successive quarters of profitability and not going public during more turbulent years is, for now, bullshit.<\/p>\n<p>Normalcy will re-emerge at some point. Things will eventually quiet down. But not yet, so get that S-1 out and take advantage of the good times while they last.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On August 5th, TechCrunch wrote that startups should &#8220;go public while software valuations make no sense.&#8221; What came next was a happy coincidence.

href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/12\/12\/glovos-sacha-michaud-i-think-there-will-be-consolidation\/\">consolidation<\/a> in the thin-margin food delivery space: Delivery Hero has announced it&#8217;s buying the LatinAm operations of Glovo, a Spanish on-demand delivery app. The German company said today that it&#8217;s paying up to \u20ac230 million to take over eight markets, including a \u20ac60 million performance-based earn-out.<\/p>\n<p>The transaction, which Berlin-based <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/delivery-hero\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"delivery-hero\">Delivery Hero <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> said it expects to close within a few weeks, will cover all of the Latin American countries where Glovo operates &#8212; namely: Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, Panama, Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/glovo-app\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"glovo-app\">Glovo <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> had already pulled out of two LatAm markets at the start of this year, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/21\/glovo-exits-the-middle-east-and-drops-two-latam-markets-in-latest-food-delivery-crunch\/\">saying then<\/a> that it was focused on markets where it could grow and establish itself among the top two delivery players. It exited the Middle East at the same time.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Offloading its LatAm operations to Delivery Hero now will leave it with 14 markets &#8212; and a fuller focus on Southern and Eastern Europe.<\/p>\n<p>The move isn&#8217;t a huge surprise, given ongoing questions over profitability in the thin-margin delivery space.<\/p>\n<p>Last December Glovo <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/12\/19\/spains-glovo-grabs-166m-series-e-for-its-deliver-anything-app\/\">told us<\/a> it was focused on trying to reach profitability &#8220;in a little over a year\u2019s time.&#8221; That essentially means winning the race with competitors to be the dominant platform where you&#8217;re operating, and only operating in cities where the unit economics stack up, so &#8212; ideally &#8212; where you can nudge users to make high volumes of repeat orders.<\/p>\n<p>Still, in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/12\/12\/glovos-sacha-michaud-i-think-there-will-be-consolidation\/\">December 2019<\/a>, Glovo&#8217;s co-founder also told us it was expecting its LatAm business to be operationally profitable this year. But perhaps challenges related to the coronavirus pandemic have pushed it to narrow its focus.<\/p>\n<p>There are also SoftBank&#8217;s billions to contend with. The Japanese tech investor has a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/07\/softbank-launches-the-innovation-fund-committing-2b-to-invest-in-latin-america\/\">$2 billion fund aimed at Central and South American<\/a> &#8212; as well as making multiple investments in on-demand delivery startup, which have been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/30\/softbank-wants-its-on-demand-portfolio-to-stop-losing-so-much-money\/\">duking it out for share in the region<\/a>. The cost of competing in the region was likely rising and that wouldn&#8217;t help Glovo&#8217;s push for profitability.<\/p>\n<p>Commenting on the sale in a statement, Glovo CEO <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/oscar-pierre\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"oscar-pierre\">Oscar Pierre <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> said: \u201cWe feel that it&#8217;s important to focus on key markets where we can build a long-term sustainable business and continue to provide our unique multi-category offering to our customers.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This deal will allow us to strengthen our presence in those markets where we are already very strong, while also allowing us to invest in new markets where we see huge growth potential and opportunity. We truly believe that Delivery Hero is the best possible partner to take the business we\u2019ve built in Latin America to the next level. They have everything it takes to go on and become the leading player in the region,&#8221; he added.<\/p>\n<p>The sale means Delivery Hero will add five new markets to its LatAm footprint, as well as removing a competitor in three markets where the two have been directly competing (Argentina, Panama and the Dominican Republic).<\/p>\n<p>In these three overlapping markets it will take over Glovo&#8217;s businesses directly, on the closing of the transaction. Glovo will continue to operate the other businesses until March 2021, they added.<\/p>\n<p>The transaction is also subject to fulfillment of certain conditions and relevant regulatory approvals.<\/p>\n<p>In a statement, Niklas \u00d6stberg, CEO and co-founder of Delivery Hero, said LatAm offers &#8220;exceptional growth potential&#8221; for his veteran food delivery business &#8212; which only <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/12\/21\/takeaway-delivery-hero-gobble-gobble\/\">two years ago<\/a> sold its operations in its home market of Germany to another rival, Takeaway.com. (So, yes, the food delivery space really is a sizzling stir-fry of deals as players jockey for position and &#8212; they hope &#8212; profitability&#8230;)<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLatin America is a region with exceptional growth potential for online delivery. Acquiring Glovo\u2019s local operations gives us the opportunity to double down on our efforts to drive innovation, continuously improve customer experience and support local vendors in the region. We have been working closely with Glovo for many years, and are proud to incorporate their Latin American services into our global network,&#8221; \u00d6stberg said.<\/p>\n<p>Back in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/26\/on-demand-grocery-startup-instashop-acquired-by-delivery-hero-for-360m\/\">August<\/a> Delivery Hero also went shopping on the grocery delivery front, picking up Dubai-based InstaShop. Grocery delivery has risen up the agenda during the coronavirus crisis, as food delivery app users have found themselves with more time at home than usual.<\/p>\n<p>Glovo also bills itself as &#8220;more than food delivery&#8221; &#8212; with a button in the app where users can request delivery of &#8220;anything&#8221; (or at least anything one of its couriers can manage on a bike or moped).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>More consolidation in the thin-margin food delivery space: Delivery Hero has announced it&#8217;s buying the LatinAm operations of Glovo, a Spanish on-demand delivery app. The German company said today that it&#8217;s paying up to \u20ac230 million to take over eight markets, including a \u20ac60 million performance-based earn-out.

One very expensive location with one brand that cannot evolve as food trends change. The result is ambitious and successful food providers not being able to capitalise on the soaring delivery market. So, we\u2019ve fixed this.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>On the demand side, Kbox has created a multicuisine range of delivery focused food brands, &#8220;so kitchens can serve more local people, more easily, with the ability to adapt swiftly to demand flux and taste changes,&#8221; she says. &#8220;And on the supply side, our tech platform digitises kitchen operations to make them efficient.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>However, Vellani claims that what makes Kbox special is its AI and machine learning tech, which enables advanced analytics. This sees the startup help kitchens find the right set of food brands for their local market, and then &#8220;future proof&#8221; them by keeping menus current through data analysis without the need for a data scientist. &#8220;Using our AI, we can also forecast demand for each kitchen, which in turn minimises waste, improves staff utilisation and morale, and thus improves the profitability of each host kitchen,&#8221; she explains.<\/p>\n<p>To that end, Vellani says there is no upfront cost to franchise Kbox brands and technology and &#8220;zero investment&#8221; in kitchen upgrades or equipment. Furthermore, Kbox generates revenue on a per order basis so it only benefits when the kitchen makes money. In other words, one of the biggest draws is there&#8217;s little risk for a host kitchen when working with Kbox.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I recall having a conversation last week with the senior EVP of one of the most well-known hotel asset owners in the world and he said to me, and I paraphrase: &#8216;so basically this is a risk-free model with absolutely no downside to us &#8212; the only thing I can see happening if this doesn&#8217;t work is you have simply upskilled my staff. I am going to make sure all of my hotel owners talk to you&#8217;,&#8221; says the Kbox founder.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, there appears to be no exact equivalent offering in the dark kitchen space currently, although there are several heavily funded players tackling the real estate angle \u2013- a kitchen rental model if you will. Others are building dark kitchen operations and licensing brands from third parties, or creating their own brands.<\/p>\n<p>Adds Vellani: &#8220;We are at the very early stages of a massive shift in not only the restaurant industry but in the food service and hospitality industry as a whole. COVID has simply accelerated a shift we were already seeing but it has also highlighted a very pertinent issue \u2013 these industries are running on razor-thin margins that are not sustainable and only Kbox is really focused on enabling existing food operators to move into the delivery-first era without incurring large costs by utilising what they already have&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>So far, the model appears to be working &#8212; hence today&#8217;s injection of capital. To date, Kbox has partnered with kitchens in London, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Brighton, and says it is on course for 2,000 operational kitchens in the U.K. before the end of 2021.

But the tried-and-true IPO is still the long-term liquidity goal for most tech startups. CEOs dream of ringing the bell on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, or seeing their face splashed across Nasdaq\u2019s giant video screen in Times Square. Late last month, five high-profile tech companies filed on the same day to go public through traditional IPOs, presumably gunning to get out before the November election.<u><\/u><u><\/u><\/p>\n<p>There is obviously a ton of operational, financial and regulatory preparation that goes into a successful initial public offering. But one aspect of IPO planning that often gets short shrift, particularly at B2B-focused companies chasing relatively niche buyer audiences, is branding and communications. As the head of marketing and communications for a big investment firm, I see this all the time. I believe companies who skimp here are throwing away significant equity value.<u><\/u><u><\/u><\/p>\n<p>Simply put, a highly public financing event like an IPO is an enormous branding opportunity for most companies. It\u2019s a free pass for companies to tell their stories to a huge, global audience and rack up high-level press coverage \u2014 both at the time of the IPO and in the future, since many publications (like my former employer, the Wall Street Journal) often focus on coverage of larger, publicly traded companies.<u><\/u><u><\/u><\/p>\n<p>Why do so many companies fall down in this area? I think a lot of it has to do with the broader shift toward data-driven, online marketing and away from branding at many companies. Because highly technical companies in areas like hybrid-cloud computing or DevSecOps (yes, that\u2019s a thing) often struggle in their early days to get journalists interested in their stories, they never make communications a priority inside the company. This comes back to haunt them when, all of the sudden, they\u2019ve filed an S-1 and their exec team has zero experience explaining the company\u2019s story in clear, persuasive terms to a general audience.<\/p>\n<p>But smart companies can avoid this trap. Here are five ways you can get the most branding bang out of your tech IPO, no matter how arcane your company\u2019s business is.<\/p>\n<h2>Don\u2019t procrastinate<\/h2>\n<p>This is honestly the most important point to take away here. Successful PR and communications around an IPO are a result of long-term planning that starts at least 12 to 18 months before you file your offering document with the SEC. Once you think an IPO is in the offing, take a hard look at both your (1) marketing\/communications staffing and (2) your existing digital footprint.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With careful planning and preparation \u2014 and plenty of help from your legal team \u2014 your brand will come out an IPO stronger than before and ready to evolve as your company moves into its next chapter of growth.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":133574325,"featured_media":2046765,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","carmot_uuid":"2f4ca7f5-62f0-37ca-b7b0-47e8bf543bbb"},"categories":[25515,576698407,20429,17396,576633018],"tags":[179,183,2639695,175],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[576796354],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/GettyImages-460688633.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/2E5iAEX","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"featured":false,"subtitle":"","fundingRound":false,"seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","premiumContent":true,"premiumCutoffPercent":0.5,"tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[1610216],"hideFeaturedImage":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2046674"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2046674"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2046674\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2046868,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2046674\/revisions\/2046868"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/rebecca-buckman"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2046674&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/133574325"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2046765"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2046674"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2046674"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2046674"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2046674"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2046674"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2046674"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2046674"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":1610216,"name":"Rebecca Buckman","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/rebecca-buckman\/","description":"Rebecca Buckman is the vice president of marketing and communications at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.battery.com\/\">Battery Ventures<\/a> in Menlo Park, CA.

the Future of Everything,\u201d from which this essay is adapted.\t<\/div>\n\t\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><p id=\"speakable-summary\">There\u2019s a growing sense of urgency when it comes to ensuring that stimulus checks and election ballots reach their recipients on a timely basis. The economic recovery and the future of our democracy hinges on that. Yet, we\u2019re using a technology invented by the ancient Egyptians more than 4,000 years ago, later perfected by the Chou dynasty in China and by Cyrus, the emperor of Persia. Organizing a modern postal system was one of the key decisions made by the Second Continental Congress in 1775. In the digital age, however, does it make sense to mail checks and ballots as if they were tangible products like medicines or shoes?<\/p>\n<p>The main advantage of postal systems is that they can potentially reach the entire population. By contrast, not everyone has a smartphone or a reliable Wi-Fi connection, or feels confident about using them. Still, the last few months have amply demonstrated that the American financial and election infrastructures are not up to speed. More than two months after the CARES Act was enshrined into law, 30-35 million stimulus checks \u2014 about 20% of the total \u2014 had not yet been issued to their intended recipients, according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/waysandmeans.house.gov\/sites\/democrats.waysandmeans.house.gov\/files\/documents\/2020.06.04%20EIPs%20Issued%20as%20of%20June%204%20FINAL.pdf\">U.S. Congress<\/a>. Meanwhile, results from several primary elections were delayed by days or even weeks in states like New York, New Jersey, Kentucky and Georgia given the avalanche of votes by mail.<\/p>\n<p>The solution to many of these quandaries could come from the world of cryptocurrencies or, to be more precise, the technology underlying them. Progress in their adoption has been thwarted by government officials, monetary authorities, and bankers in the U.S. and abroad, who have swiftly come to the rescue of legal tender, predicting nothing short of economic and financial apocalypse if cryptocurrencies were to be widely adopted. Watching the trials and tribulations of bitcoin and the reception given to <a href=\"https:\/\/libra.org\/en-US\/\">Libra<\/a>, the Facebook-led consortium, it seems clear that cryptocurrencies are unlikely to be widely used unless they become much more than a mere substitute for money.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>So far, cryptocurrencies have been used as a form of electronic cash in which transactions are authenticated by senders using cryptography. Payments and balances are recorded using blockchain technology, which provides for frictionless speed of transactions, transparency and security. (It has been estimated that breaking the bitcoin key is as likely as winning the Powerball nine times in a row.) Still, government officials and bankers are not persuaded they are necessary, or even useful.<\/p>\n<p>But what if we turned cryptocurrencies into multipurpose digital tokens with a use value far greater than as a form of cash? Traditional money has exchange value, but zero use value (apologies for appealing to Karl Marx to make the point). What if we reinvented money altogether so that it helps not just with payments but with elections as well?<\/p>\n<p>Every day, billions of transactions are made in the global market economy. With each one, there are at least two counterparties: For example, a buyer and seller, an insurer and insured, or a borrower and lender. More broadly, humans engage in all kinds of transactions where there is a party and counterparty, including legal agreements like marriage, divorce or a will that distributes property after someone dies. Digital tokens may make this whole process easier and cheaper.<\/p>\n<p>And it won\u2019t end there. Virtually everything can be turned into a token, including equities, commodities, debt, real estate, art, births, civil unions, diplomas, votes and so on. Even data could be turned into a token, potentially disrupting the likes of Google and Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>The beauty of the blockchain is that it enables all manner of lateral extensions from its original, intended purpose. One possibility is to combine digital currencies with smart contracts, digital record management and decentralized autonomous organizations \u2014 all ideas supported by the so-called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/insights\/2015\/01\/block-chain-2-0\/\">Blockchain 2.0<\/a>, first proposed half a decade ago. Tax collection might also be made less complex by automatically deducting the government\u2019s share from every transaction recorded on the blockchain. In general, the management of supply chains at companies would be simplified and accelerated though a combination of the mechanisms involving contract execution, record keeping, tracking, payment collection and restocking.<\/p>\n<p>Another lateral application of digital tokens would relate to the interaction between governments and citizens, political parties and their voters, or corporations and shareholders. Elections, for instance, are still conducted around the world using paper ballots or very rudimentary voting machines. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/blockchain-a6c1\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"blockchain-a6c1\">Blockchain <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>-enabled e-voting would eliminate the need for voting stations, making it more convenient to vote. Each citizen registered to vote would have a unique digital token for each candidate or issue being voted on.<\/p>\n<p>They could exercise the right to vote after authentication using a personal key. Engagement and turnout might increase, although digital accessibility is a concern that could augment inequality. In fact, with blockchain technology voter participation might be even higher among the better educated and more sophisticated groups of individuals who already have higher participation rates. For national elections, the stakes would be high. &#8220;It is not enough for the result to be fair and valid,&#8221; argues a <a href=\"https:\/\/op.europa.eu\/en\/publication-detail\/-\/publication\/9964fbfd-6141-11e7-8dc1-01aa75ed71a1\">study\u00a0published by the European Parliament<\/a>. &#8220;The whole electorate, even if they are disappointed with the result, must accept that the process was legitimate and reliable. As such, beyond providing actual security and accuracy, [e-voting] must also inspire confidence and trust.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>What if we thought laterally in yet another direction? What if we used digital tokens and blockchain technology to force government officials to automatically act on campaign promises under certain pre-agreed conditions? Taxpayers would use cryptocurrency in exchange for accountability. For instance, after an election certain policies could be implemented through binding smart contracts or money allocated to specific budgetary categories. Or citizens could track how much the government is spending and whether it is fulfilling its promises.<\/p>\n<p>Smart contracts could be used throughout the economy, and not just in the context of government policymaking. They include a set of instructions agreed upon by the parties to a transaction that would be automatically triggered if certain conditions are met. A simple example would be a loan contract whereby a lower insurance premium on a mortgage kicks in if the market interest rate goes down. A 2016\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/assets.publishing.service.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/492972\/gs-16-1-distributed-ledger-technology.pdf\">report by the U.K. Government Chief Scientific Advisor<\/a> proposed using blockchain technology and digital tokens to improve government services by cutting costs, supporting compliance and fostering accountability. It would also help collect taxes, disburse benefits and make interactions with citizens more fluid.<\/p>\n<p>Several countries have already realized some of the potential of digital tokens. Estonia, home to the most advanced e-government in the world, so much so that it presents itself to the world as <a href=\"https:\/\/e-estonia.com\/\">e-estonia<\/a>. The citizens of this tiny country of 1.3 million can apply for benefits, obtain medical prescriptions, register their businesses, vote and access nearly 3,000 other government digital services online. In 2016, Wired named Estonia &#8220;the most advanced digital society in the world.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Some African countries like Ghana and Kenya are at the forefront of global efforts to bring government closer to the people through technology. According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/projects.worldbank.org\/en\/projects-operations\/project-detail\/P093610?lang=en__\">World Bank<\/a>, &#8220;the eGhana project represented a pioneering design for ICT [information and communication technology] projects that is being replicated in a number of African countries.&#8221; An independent research team evaluated Kenya\u2019s efforts and concluded that the country &#8220;has created an enabling political, legal and business environment that is suitable for the implementation of \u2026 e-government,&#8221; bringing benefits such as a &#8220;reduction of bureaucracy, round the clock accessibility of services, fast and convenient transactions, increased transparency and accountability, improved staff productivity, and easy flow of information.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The potential of multipurpose digital tokens is truly unlimited. A key geopolitical issue of our time is copyright infringement. Many a trade war has started as a result of systematic intellectual property theft, including the ongoing row between the U.S. and China. Copyright owners could enforce their rights much more easily if they accepted digital cash tied to royalty payments, offering companies and individuals a discount for using the system. A global economy powered by technology is no place for traditional, bureaucratic regulation and authentication of intellectual property use. This is especially the case with complex products such as cars or computers, and also with intangible content like software, music and video.<\/p>\n<p>Digital tokens could also give people and companies incentives to engage in pro-environmental behavior. One potentially important proposal is to enable companies and individuals to transform carbon credits into digital tokens that can be traded on an exchange or converted into cryptocurrency, or to help homeowners sell their excess solar power without the cumbersome paperwork involved in dealing with their local utility.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/energitoken.com\/\">EnergiMine<\/a>, a startup, uses the blockchain to give people &#8220;gold stars&#8221; in the form of tokens if they reduce their carbon footprint by taking public transportation, replacing their old appliances with efficient ones, or better insulating their homes. The tokens can be used to pay for utility bills or exchanged for cryptocurrency at a discount. A similar system could be set up for certain categories of consumer goods that leave behind a large carbon footprint, including food, beverages, clothing and personal care products. Consumers would thus be able to gauge the environmental impact of their purchases.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s an obvious downside to the use of information technologies to save the planet \u2014 it turns out they\u2019re major contributors to climate change themselves. Forecasts indicate that by 2030 more than 20% of electricity will be used to power the information and telecommunications infrastructure, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/d41586-018-06610-y\">Nature<\/a> reported.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Data centers contribute around 0.3% to overall carbon emissions, whereas the information and communications technology (ICT) ecosystem as a whole \u2014 under a sweeping definition that encompasses personal digital devices, mobile-phone networks and televisions \u2014 accounts for more than 2% of global emissions. That puts ICT\u2019s carbon footprint on a par with the aviation industry\u2019s emissions from fuel.&#8221; That\u2019s not even counting the anticipated increase in cryptocurrency trading, which is extremely energy consuming. &#8220;We are a very data-hungry society, we\u2019re using more and more and more data and all of that is using more and more energy.&#8221; Digital tokens could also be used to encourage the companies that operate data centers to use renewable sources of energy.<\/p>\n<p>Besides citizen services, intellectual property, and tackling climate change, digital tokens with both use and exchange value could provide a system for tracing guns, protecting endangered species and certifying the origin of diamonds, among many other applications. Cryptocurrencies will only capture the imagination of users \u2014 and perhaps regulators \u2014 if they transform the way in which we think about money and how we use money; if they open new horizons and possibilities not only for doing business or managing our personal finances but for improving our lives. If digital currencies merely substitute for cash, then we might be disappointed.<\/p>\n<p>But if we can do away with the high costs of moving cash around while at the same time providing incentives for individuals to preserve resources or diminish their carbon footprint, then we might witness a tectonic shift in the world of finance \u2014 and create a better future at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, digital tokens are a formidable tool when it comes to encouraging individual and group behavior that helps society. For digital tokens to become widely used, people need to receive some immediate benefit (like ease of use or a reduced cost per transaction) in addition to the long-term benefit to everyone in society (a reduction in carbon emissions). For instance, the interest paid on my holdings of cryptocurrency should be higher if I reduce my wasteful behavior concerning food and clothes by sharing them on a digital platform. Cryptocurrencies will triumph only to the extent that entrepreneurs find ways to integrate more uses into them.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s clearly too late to make digital tokens available to deliver stimulus money or election ballots. But it\u2019s never too early to start designing a better, more reliable and fairer system for it to be ready for the next election \u2014 or the next big crisis.<\/p>\n<p><em>This post is an adapted excerpt from Mauro Gullien&#8217;s book, &#8220;2030: How Today\u2019s Biggest Trends Will Collide and Reshape the Future of Everything.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s never too early to start designing a better, more reliable and fairer system for it to be ready for the next election\u2014or the next big crisis.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":133574325,"featured_media":2046213,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","carmot_uuid":"026b3234-de96-3e22-b948-2ecadbf85500"},"categories":[25515,576601119,15835174,15986864,352,13217,17396],"tags":[36507086,64575263,277387,576749196,188181,576601068],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/GettyImages-1160876643.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/2H1TWpP","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"featured":false,"subtitle":"","fundingRound":false,"seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","premiumContent":false,"premiumCutoffPercent":1,"tc_cb_mapping":[{"slug":"blockchain","cb_name":"Blockchain","cb_slug":"blockchain-a6c1-organization","cb_link":"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/blockchain-a6c1"},{"slug":"bitcoin","cb_name":"Bitcoin","cb_slug":"bitcoin-llc-organization","cb_link":"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/bitcoin-llc"}],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[2046202],"hideFeaturedImage":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2046204"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2046204"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2046204\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2046685,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2046204\/revisions\/2046685"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/mauro-guillen"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2046204&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/133574325"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2046213"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2046204"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2046204"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2046204"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2046204"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2046204"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2046204"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2046204"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":2046202,"name":"Mauro Guillen","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/mauro-guillen\/","description":"Mauro Guillen is a professor of international management at the Wharton School and the author of \u201c2030: How the Biggest Trends Today will Collide and Shape the Future of Everything,\u201d from which this essay is adapted.","slug":"mauro-guillen","links":{"twitter":"MauroFGuillen"},"position":"Contributor","cbDescription":"Mauro Guillen is a professor of international management at the Wharton School and the author of \u201c2030: How the Biggest Trends Today will Collide and Shape the Future of Everything,\u201d from which this essay is adapted.","cbAvatar":"","twitter":"MauroFGuillen"}],"author":[{"id":133574325,"name":"Walter Thompson","url":"https:\/\/anchor.fm\/thegoldencity","description":"Senior Editor Walter Thompson manages Extra Crunch and TechCrunch's guest post program.

arrives today, bringing with it a handful of features aimed at keeping the company on the bleeding edge of the action camera category. GoPro has, of course, experienced a good deal of competition in the category for which it\u2019s become synonymous. The most notable recent entrant is drone giant DJI, which aimed to carve out a name in the space with a few key features.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s hard not to see the Hero 9 Black\u2019s biggest addition as a direct counterstrike against one-time partner, DJI. The new action cam joins the Osmo Action camera by picking up a front-facing display. The 1.4-inch selfie-screen is designed to, among other things, make it easier to set up shots \u2014 something that\u2019s been difficult with just a rear display to rely on. The touchscreen has been made larger (from 1.95 to 2.27 inch), too.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That\u2019s owing, in part, to a bigger body. That\u2019s nice as far as the screen and battery (upgraded from 1,220 to 1,720 mAh) are concerned, but poses an issue for those looking to hang onto older accessories from previous models. The shooting resolution has been bumped up. You can now grab 20-megapixel stills and shoot 5K video at 30 FPS.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">The camera goes up for sale today, priced at $450 or $350, if you also buy the one-year subscription to GoPro\u2019s software service. There\u2019s also a $100 Max Lens mod, which increase\u2019s the camera\u2019s stabilization and field-of-view.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After leaking like crazy, the GoPro Hero 9 Black arrives today, bringing with it a handful of features aimed at keeping the company on the bleeding edge of the action camera category.

class=\"wp-caption-text\">WASHINGTON, DC &#8211; DECEMBER 09: The Justice Department building on a foggy morning on December 9, 2019 in Washington, DC. <strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Samuel Corum\/Getty Images<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The Justice Department has announced charges against five alleged Chinese citizens, accused of hacking over 100 companies in the United States, including tech companies, game makers, universities and think tanks.<\/p>\n<p>Zhang Haoran and Tan Dailin were charged in August 2019 with over two dozen counts of conspiracy, wire fraud, identity theft and charges related to computer hacking. Prosecutors also added nine additional charges against Jiang Lizhi, Qian Chuan, and Fu Qiang last month.<\/p>\n<p>Prosecutors also charged two businessmen, who were arrested in Malaysia, for their role in trying to profit from the group&#8217;s intrusions into game companies to steal and sell digital goods and virtual currency.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Today\u2019s charges, the related arrests, seizures of malware and other infrastructure used to conduct intrusions, and coordinated private sector protective actions reveal yet again the department\u2019s determination to use all of the tools at its disposal and to collaborate with the private sector and nations who support the rule of law in cyberspace,&#8221; said Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is the only way to neutralize malicious nation-state cyber activity,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>The hackers are accused of being members of the China-backed APT41 hacking group, also known as &#8220;Barium,&#8221; to steal source code, customer data and other valuable business information from businesses in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Hong Kong, South Korea and other countries.<\/p>\n<p>The indictments said that the hackers worked for a front company, Chengdu 404, which purports to be a network security company but prosecutors say was a cover for the hackers. The alleged hackers used a number of known security vulnerabilities to break into companies and launch attacks against a company&#8217;s supply chains, allowing the hackers to break into other companies. The indictments confirm <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fireeye.com\/blog\/threat-research\/2020\/03\/apt41-initiates-global-intrusion-campaign-using-multiple-exploits.html\">earlier research<\/a> from security firm FireEye that said\u00a0APT41 hackers used vulnerabilities <a href=\"https:\/\/www.csoonline.com\/article\/3534003\/chinese-hacker-group-apt41-uses-recent-exploits-to-target-companies-worldwide.html\">against networking gear<\/a> to break into their victims\u2019 networks.<\/p>\n<p>The hackers also allegedly stole code-signing certificates, which can be used to trick computers into thinking malware is from a legitimate source and safe to run. Last year, APT41 was <a href=\"https:\/\/content.fireeye.com\/apt-41\/rpt-apt41\/\">blamed<\/a> for a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/25\/asus-update-backdoor\/\">supply chain attack<\/a> at computer maker Asus, which saw the attackers push a backdoor to at least hundreds of thousands of computers using the company&#8217;s own servers.<\/p>\n<p>Prosecutors said the hackers tried to make money by launching ransomware attacks and cryptojacking schemes, which hijack computers with malware to mine cryptocurrency.<\/p>\n<p>John Hultquist, senior director of analysis at Mandiant, said APT41 has been the &#8220;most prolific&#8221; Chinese threat group it&#8217;s tracked over the last year.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;This is a unique actor, who carries out global cyber espionage while simultaneously pursuing a criminal venture. Their activity traces back to 2012 when individual members of APT41 conducted primarily financially motivated operations focused on the video game industry before expanding into traditional espionage, most likely directed by the state. APT41\u2019s ability to successfully blend their criminal and espionage operations is remarkable,&#8221; said Hultquist.<\/p>\n<p>After the indictments were filed, prosecutors said they obtained warrants to seize websites, domains and servers associated with the group\u2019s operations, effectively shutting them down and hindering their operations.<\/p>\n<p>The alleged hackers are still believed to be in China, but the allegations serve as a \u201cname and shame&#8221; effort employed by the Justice Department in recent years against state-backed cyber attackers.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Dw8ju2CKPu\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/04\/google-china-iran-trump-biden\/\">Google says Iranian, Chinese hackers targeted Trump, Biden campaigns<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Google says Iranian, Chinese hackers targeted Trump, Biden campaigns&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/04\/google-china-iran-trump-biden\/embed\/#?secret=Dw8ju2CKPu\" data-secret=\"Dw8ju2CKPu\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Justice Department has announced charges against five alleged Chinese citizens, accused of hacking over 100 companies in the United States, including tech companies, game makers, universities and think tanks.

Apple&#8217;s increased attention to potential in-app purchase losses also saw it rejecting the WordPress app at one point, forcing the company to <a href=\"https:\/\/arstechnica.com\/tech-policy\/2020\/08\/apple-apologizes-to-wordpress-no-longer-requires-free-app-to-add-purchases\/\">issue a rare apology<\/a> after being called out publicly.<\/p>\n<p>Now, Apple is <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/12\/this-week-in-apps-the-app-stores-new-rules-epics-battle-continues-tiktoks-time-is-up\/\">battling<\/a> in court with Fortnite maker Epic Games over Apple&#8217;s right to commission Epic&#8217;s business when there&#8217;s no other means of addressing the iPhone market outside of Apple&#8217;s App Store. A company as large as Epic doesn&#8217;t need to rely on the services Apple provides, like distribution and Apple Pay, it argues, but is forced to by Apple&#8217;s terms.<\/p>\n<p>Developers have also been taking note of how Apple describes its App Store business in its court filings, calling it something developers &#8220;reap the benefits from&#8221; &#8212; a turn of phrase that <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/marcoarment\/status\/1303462987924221952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1303462987924221952%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2020%2F09%2F12%2Fthis-week-in-apps-the-app-stores-new-rules-epics-battle-continues-tiktoks-time-is-up%2F\">rubbed some developers the wrong way<\/a>. After all, people buy iPhones for a number of reasons, but its ability to run apps is high among them.<\/p>\n<p>Developers have watched, too, as Apple attempted to yank away Epic&#8217;s Apple Developer accounts, including those for its related game development platform, Unity, as well as Epic&#8217;s ability to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2020\/09\/09\/sign-in-with-apple-epic-games-disabled\/\">support its users through &#8220;Sign in with Apple.&#8221;<\/a> These hardball tactics on Apple&#8217;s part made it apparent to developers that Apple is ready and willing to leverage developers&#8217; dependence on Apple&#8217;s tools to punish any developers who step out of line.<\/p>\n<p>Then there&#8217;s the fact that Apple has been the focus of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/29\/apples-app-store-commission-structure-called-into-question-in-antitrust-hearing\/\">antitrust investigations into its App Store business<\/a> that revealed how the company cut special deals, despite its claims that the App Store is &#8220;an even playing field.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Recently, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/11\/apple-revises-app-store-rules-to-permit-game-streaming-apps-clarify-in-app-purchases-and-more\/\">Apple updated its App Store rules<\/a> to better spell out its terms around commissions and to find a path for new game streaming services to join the App Store. But the result is <a href=\"https:\/\/marco.org\/2020\/09\/11\/app-review-changes\">that its rules have now grown so complex<\/a>, with so many carve-outs and exceptions, that some developers may be confused about what&#8217;s permitted.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to this growing swell of developer resentment, Apple sprung the next-day release of iOS 14 on a developer community who, like everyone else, is trying to function during the coronavirus pandemic &#8212; a crisis that has completely upended people&#8217;s day-to-day lives. Many developers are now working remotely and homeschooling children.

Given the size of the fund, it&#8217;s maybe no surprise that the firm will partner with other VCs to make these investments.

And Unity has what investors are generally looking for inside that sector: greater than 40% revenue growth, gross margins in the high-70s to low-80s, and falling losses in both percent-of-revenue and gross dollar terms.<\/p>\n<p>At $48 per share, Unity would sell $1.20 billion in stock, and be valued at around $12.6 billion. Given its most recent quarter&#8217;s revenue ($184.3 million) and annualized run-rate ($737.4 million), Unity is valued at around 17.1x revenues. (You can make that multiple larger by using a trailing revenue metric instead of an annualized run-rate statistic, or lower it by using a forward revenue estimate.)<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll have a better feel for how hot the public markets are later today when <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/snowflake-computing\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"snowflake-computing\">Snowflake <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and JFrog start, but Unity&#8217;s upward pricing bodes well for all three firms.

For a monthly subscription fee, you can access a gaming PC in a data center near you. Compared to other cloud gaming services, such as GeForce Now or Google\u2019s Stadia, Shadow provides a full Windows 10 instance. You can install anything you want \u2014 Steam, Photoshop or Word.<\/p>\n<p>The company has been growing rapidly over the past few years and raised more than $100 million in total. Last year, the company announced <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/29\/shadow-announces-new-plans-for-its-cloud-gaming-platform\/\">ambitious plans<\/a>, with a wide-ranging partnership with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ovhcloud.com\">OVHcloud<\/a> and high-end configurations.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>At the same time, co-founder Emmanuel Freund stepped aside as CEO, with J\u00e9r\u00f4me Arnaud taking over. There have been multiple delays with the new product offering and the company is no longer working with OVHcloud. Freund left the company in April and, as INpact Hardware <a href=\"https:\/\/www.inpact-hardware.com\/article\/1962\/pc-dans-cloud-shadow-encore-retard-et-non-dit\">reported in July<\/a>, Arnaud has been on the way out for a couple of months.<\/p>\n<p>All of this leads us to today\u2019s announcement. Mike Fischer, the company\u2019s new CEO, has been quite active in the video game industry. In the past, he has worked at Sega, Bandai Namco, Microsoft and Epic Games. He was the president and CEO of Square Enix between 2010 and 2013.<\/p>\n<p>Jean-Baptiste Kempf is a well-known figure in the open-source community. For the past 14 years, he has been the president of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.videolan.org\">VideoLAN<\/a>, the organization behind popular media player VLC. VideoLAN has also contributed to widely used video encoding technologies. He also founded <a href=\"https:\/\/videolabs.io\">VideoLabs<\/a>, a company that works on VLC-related integrations and support.<\/p>\n<p>The company is still working on rolling out the new Ultra and Infinite configurations to European users who pre-ordered. It <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/12\/cloud-gaming-platform-shadow-brings-its-new-plans-to-the-us\/\">originally planned<\/a> to start rolling out new tiers in the U.S. starting this summer but the company now says it expects to launch these new tiers by the end of the year.<\/p>\n<p>For customers in the U.S., there are no pre-orders, there will simply be a button to upgrade in your account when it\u2019s available. LG invested in the company earlier this year and the service will go live in South Korea later this year, as well.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are some changes at the helm of Blade, the French startup behind Shadow.

href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/suranga-chandratillake\">Suranga Chandratillake<\/a> has (almost) seen it all. After being the early CTO for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/autonomy\">Autonomy<\/a>, he went on to found the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/blinkx\">blinkx<\/a> video search engine in 2004, long before many thought we\u2019d even need one. He scaled the company to San Francisco and the U.S. market, eventually IPO\u2019ing blinkx for more than $1 billion. On his return to Europe, he joined <a href=\"https:\/\/www.balderton.com\/\">Balderton Capital<\/a>, one of Europe\u2019s top-tier VCs, and has invested in many of Europe\u2019s hottest startups. As part of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/disrupt-sf-2020\/\">TechCrunch Disrupt 2020<\/a>, we caught up with him.<\/p>\n<p>Last year Balderton raised a $400 million fund. But has the way that fund is being invested changed because of COVID-19?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn many ways, nothing has changed,\u201d he said. \u201dWe have been a series of focused pan-European VC for 20 years\u2026 If anything, I think COVID-19 has demonstrated how tech can help us get through various challenges, and I mean all of the work from home stuff\u2026 It\u2019s been really weird, not being able to spend time in person with those people [entrepreneurs]\u2026 But the overall strategy of investing in tech in Europe, it&#8217;s exactly the same as it was before.\u201d<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Although it\u2019s not that simple. For instance, Balderton invested in car rental startup <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/11\/virtuo-series-b\/\">Virtuo<\/a> to the tune of \u20ac20 million. And travel is not exactly a great sector right now.<\/p>\n<p>Chandratillake admitted, \u201csome industries we have had challenges this year.\u201d However, he said they \u201chad a difficult April and May, but they&#8217;ve actually had a booming August\u201d as holidays came back.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI would say that by and large, most [startups] have navigated fairly well.\u201d He noted that European governments have put in place funds to support tech companies, and, of course, other sectors of tech have boomed.<\/p>\n<p>During the pandemic lockdown, many consumers jumped into virtual networking via apps like <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/zoom-video-communications\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"zoom-video-communications\">Zoom <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and Houseparty, but Balderton did a small investment into a stealth-mode startup called Riff, which, not unlike Clubhouse, is using audio in a new way. He hinted that this will be an enterprise-play on Audio.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFunnily enough, the closest to it right now is probably Discord, which obviously is already a large network, but really a very much a vertical app aimed at gamers\u2026 But I think there&#8217;s an opportunity to do something similar in enterprise in the same way that Slack, you know, arguably got a lot of its initial cues from consumer messaging [such as] from WhatsApp or <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/facebook\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"facebook\">Facebook <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Messenger. I think we&#8217;ll see a similar thing where the enterprise gets something that&#8217;s based a bit on what we&#8217;ve seen in consumer products.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He said Riff solves the \u201cclassic cliche of the water cooler moment when you bump into someone in the office and have a chat, and it&#8217;s really hard to do that in this new reality.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He also said there are interesting sub-markets following on the coattails of Zoom \u201cthat also need to be worked out.\u201d Balderton invested in a company called DemoDesk (a cloud-based screen-sharing platform), which looks at, for example, \u201cwebinars and sales meetings and specific kinds of conversations like that, where the requirements are a bit different.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f5c0f26ae62e42c37634fd7\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n<p>Chandratillake is of the opinion that the world will have to live with COVID-19 for many years, but that new solutions will emerge to mitigate the downsides: \u201cAnything that helps you stay more connected to your colleagues and your co-workers is going to be interesting from a VC point of view, right?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In terms of the diversity issues thrown up by the Black Lives Matter movement, Balderton has backed initiatives such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.diversity.vc\/\">Diversity VC<\/a> in Europe.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf you&#8217;ve got a more diverse venture capital industry, they will start to back more diverse founders doing more diverse things, and that will naturally propagate. That&#8217;s really important to me and that&#8217;s a big part of what we focused on&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In the last three years, we&#8217;ve hired more women than we have men into the investment team. We recently hired our first female general partner directly into the firm\u2026 three more people of color in the partnership and so on. So it&#8217;s beginning to change to where it should be, but I think it&#8217;s one of these things where you have to battle on many fronts.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Suranga Chandratillake has (almost) seen it all.
