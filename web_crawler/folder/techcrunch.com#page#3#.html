The app returned to the store eight hours later, but the controversy and acrimony Google has stirred up in the country will linger for years.<\/p>\n<p>TechCrunch reported on Friday that Google pulled <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/paytm\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"paytm\">Paytm <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> app from its app store after a repeat pattern of violations of Google Play Store guidelines by the Indian firm.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Paytm, which is locked in a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/03\/google-and-walmarts-phonepe-establish-dominance-in-indias-mobile-payments-market-as-whatsapp-pay-struggles-to-launch\/\">battle against Google to win India\u2019s payments market<\/a>, has been frustrated at Google\u2019s policies &#8212; which it argues gives Google an unfair advantage &#8212; for several past quarters over how the Android-maker is limiting its marketing campaigns to acquire new users, sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>The explanation provided by Google to Paytm for why it pulled the Indian firm\u2019s app this week from its app store is the latest attempt by the company to thwart the Noida-headquartered firm\u2019s ability to acquire new users, Paytm executives said.<\/p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.paytm.com\/the-story-behind-paytm-apps-de-listing-from-google-play-store-42b3b6f54da0\">blog post<\/a> Paytm posted Sunday evening (local India time), the Indian firm said Google took issue with the company for giving customers cashbacks and scratch cards for initiating transactions over UPI, a government-backed payments infrastructure in India that has become the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/01\/upi-india-growth-startups-business-model\/\">most popular way for people to exchange money digitally in the country.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Paytm said it rolled out this new version of scratch cards that are linked to cricket on September 11. Users collected these cricket-themed stickers for sending money to others, or making transactions such as topping up credit on their phone or paying their broadband or electricity bill.<\/p>\n<p>In a statement on Sunday evening, a Google spokesperson said, \u201coffering cashbacks and vouchers alone do not constitute a violation of our Google Play gambling policies\u201d and that Play Store \u201cpolicies are applied and enforced on all developers consistently.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But it\u2019s arguably anything but consistent.<\/p>\n<p>On September 18, Google told Paytm that it had pulled its app for not complying with Play Store\u2019s \u201cgambling policy\u201d as it offered games with \u201cloyalty points.\u201d Paytm said that Google had not expressed any concerns over Paytm\u2019s new marketing campaign prior to its notice on Friday, in which it revealed that Paytm app had been temporarily removed from the Play Store.<\/p>\n<p>But Google itself is running a similar campaign linked to cricket in India, Paytm argues. (Why cricket? Cricket is immensely popular in India and one of the biggest cricket tournaments globally, Indian Premier League, kicked off its latest season on Saturday.)<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2049284\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2049284\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2049284 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"286\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg 3284w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=150,42 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=300,84 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=768,214 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=680,190 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=1536,428 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=2048,571 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=50,14 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2049284\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cricket-themed cashback offered by Paytm (left) and Google Pay (right) in India<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Google Play Store in India has long prohibited apps that promote gambling such as betting on sporting events, and Google has raised concerns about Paytm&#8217;s marquee app promoting Paytm First Games, a fantasy sports app run by Paytm, in the past.<\/p>\n<p>Paytm executives argued that <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/phonepe\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"phonepe\">PhonePe, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> a Walmart-owned payments app in India, also promoted Dream11, the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/indian-fantasy-sports-app-dream11s-parent-firm-raises-225m-at-over-2-5b-valuation\/\">most popular fantasy sports app in the country<\/a>, and got away without any action.<\/p>\n<p>Google also permits fantasy sports app operators &#8212; including Paytm &#8212; to advertise on Search in India.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-theme=\"light\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Where is Google hypocritical?

The removal of Paytm app was only on the grounds of Paytm offering cricket-themed cashback, he claimed. \u201cGoogle is not allowing us to acquire new customers right now. That\u2019s all what this is,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s payments app, Google Pay, competes with Paytm in India. In fact, Google Pay is the largest payments app for peer-to-peer transaction between users in India and holds the largest market share in UPI.<\/p>\n<p>Without identifying any names, Sharma, the poster child of Indian startup ecosystem, claimed that many founders in India have just accepted that it is Google that has the final say on any matter in India &#8212; and not the country\u2019s regulatory agencies.<\/p>\n<p>For Google, which reaches more users than any other company in India and whose Android operating system commands 99% of the local smartphone market, this kind of accusation is exactly what it needs to avoid in the country. The Silicon Valley search and advertising giant has launched a charm offensive in India, including a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/13\/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india\/\">recently commitment to invest $10 billion<\/a> &#8212;\u00a0more than any other American or Chinese technology firm.<\/p>\n<p>The timing for Google&#8217;s parent company, Alphabet, couldn&#8217;t be worse. Google is currently the <a href=\"https:\/\/in.reuters.com\/article\/us-india-google-antitrust-exclusive\/exclusive-google-faces-antitrust-case-in-india-over-payments-app-sources-idUKKBN2331G3\">subject of an antitrust complaint<\/a> in India over an allegation that it has abused its market position to unfairly promote its mobile payments app in the country; and in the U.S., Congress has intimidated that it may pursue antitrust regulatory action against Alphabet and Apple over app store concerns.<\/p>\n<p>In India, Google&#8217;s moves could have a devastating impact on businesses and everyday consumers.<\/p>\n<p>Paytm is not just a payments app. It is also a fully licensed digital bank. And just an eight-hour of absence from the Play Store created a panic among a portion of its users. A source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that Paytm saw several people withdraw their fixed deposit in Paytm Payments Bank on Friday.<\/p>\n<p>Anecdotally, TechCrunch heard of instances where vendors who previously preferred Paytm for accepting money digitally asked their customers to use a different payments method as they had heard that Paytm was \u201cbanned\u201d in India.<\/p>\n<p>Sharma said Google&#8217;s monopoly on Indian app ecosystem is of a magnitude unparalleled elsewhere in the world.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf paying someone and getting a cashback is gambling, then the same rule should be applied to everyone,\u201d said Sharma. \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful that we are standing here at the cusp of an internet revolution in India and we are being sanctioned by companies that are not governed by the law of this country.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If this sentiment gained traction in India it could create challenges for Google&#8217;s future in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. is forcing a Chinese company to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/19\/tiktok-deal-terms\/\">sell stakes to local firms to continue operations in the country<\/a>. In a recent episode of Dithering podcast, Ben Thompson cautioned that Trump administration\u2019s move &#8212; which some have argued is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/08\/18\/opinion\/tiktok-wechat-ban-trump.html\">a long due tit for tat against Chinese companies<\/a> (as China has long prevented U.S. firms from meaningfully operating in the world&#8217;s largest \u00a0internet market) &#8212;\u00a0might encourage\u00a0other open markets to do to American firms what it is doing to TikTok.<\/p>\n<p>Several U.S. tech executives share these concerns.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The problem with this TikTok deal is that the US is the largest player in tech globally.

One was innovative, one made clones. One was a free market while the other demanded payments to a political party and its leadership, a corrupt wealth generating scam that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/business\/global\/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html\">by some estimates<\/a> has netted top leaders billions of dollars. One kept the talent borders porous acting as a magnet for the world\u2019s top brains while the other interviewed you in a backroom at the airport before imprisoning you on sedition charges (okay, that might have been both).<\/p>\n<p>The comparison was always facile yes, but it was easy and at least directionally accurate if failing on the specifics.<\/p>\n<p>Now though, the country that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2019\/04\/lithium-ion-batteries-amazon-are-exploding\/587005\/\">exported exploding batteries<\/a> is pioneering quantum computing, while the country that pioneered the internet <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/03\/made-in-america-is-on-government-life-support-and-the-prognosis-isnt-good\/\">now builds planes that fall out of the sky<\/a> (and good news, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/boeing-flags-additional-787-production-problem-11599577936\">we\u2019ve identified even more planes<\/a> that might fall out of the sky at an airport near you!)<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tiktok\">TikTok\u2019s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> success is many things, but it is quite frankly just an embarrassment for the United States. There are thousands of entrepreneurs and hundreds of venture capitalists swarming Silicon Valley and the other American innovation hubs looking for the next great social app or building it themselves. But the power law of user growth and investor returns happens to reside in Haidian, Beijing. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/bytedance\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"bytedance\">ByteDance <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> through its local apps in China and overseas apps like TikTok <i>is<\/i> the consumer investor return of the past decade (there\u2019s a reason why all the IPOs this seasons are enterprise SaaS).<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a win that you can\u2019t chalk up just to industrial policy. Unlike in semiconductors or other capital-intensive industries where Beijing can offer billions in incentives to spur development, ByteDance builds apps. It distributes them on app stores across the world. It has exactly the same tools available to it that every entrepreneur with an Apple Developer account has access to. There is no <a href=\"https:\/\/www.csis.org\/analysis\/made-china-2025\">Made in China 2025<\/a> plan to build and popularize a consumer app like TikTok (you literally can\u2019t plan for consumer success like that). Instead, it\u2019s a well-executed product that\u2019s addictive to hundreds of millions of people.<\/p>\n<p>So much as China protected its industry from overseas competitors like Google and Amazon through market-entry barriers, America is now protecting its entrenched incumbents from overseas competitors like TikTok. We\u2019re demanding joint ventures and local cloud data sovereignty just as the Communist Party has demanded for years.<\/p>\n<p>Hell, we\u2019re apparently demanding a $5 billion tax payment from ByteDance, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-09-20\/trump-wants-5-billion-from-tiktok-deal-for-new-history-project\">which the president says will fund patriotic education for youth<\/a>. The president says a lot of things of course, but at least the $5 billion price point has been confirmed by Oracle in its press release over night (what the tax revenue will <i>actually<\/i> be used for is anyone\u2019s guess). If you followed the recent Hong Kong protests for a long time, you will remember that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-hongkong-patriotism\/hong-kong-frets-over-china-model-patriotic-education-idUSBRE86A09L20120711\">patriotic youth education<\/a> was some of the original tinder for those demonstrations back in 2012. What comes around, goes around, I guess.<\/p>\n<p>Development economists like to talk about \u201ccatch-up\u201d strategies, tactics that countries can take to avoid the middle income trap and cut the gap between the West and the rest. But what we need now are developed economists to explain America\u2019s \u201cfall behind\u201d strategy. Because we are falling behind, in pretty much everything.<\/p>\n<p>As the TikTok process and the earlier Huawei imbroglio show, America is no longer on the leading edge of technology in many key strategic markets. Mainland Chinese companies are globally winning in areas as diverse as 5G and social networks, and without direct government intervention to kill that innovation, American and European tech purveyors would have lost those markets entirely (and even <i>with<\/i> those interventions, they may still lose them). In Taiwan, TSMC has come from behind Intel to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/051b2c80-d53b-410e-8e80-f433d25a82dd\">take a year or two lead<\/a> in the fabrication of the most advanced semiconductors.<\/p>\n<p>I mean, we can\u2019t even pilfer Chinese history and mythology and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/21428088\/mulan-review-disney-live-action-remake\">turn it into a decent god damn film<\/a> these days.<\/p>\n<p>And the fall-behind strategy continues. Immigration restrictions from an administration hell-bent on destroying the single greatest source of American innovation, coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic, have fused into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/international-student-enrollment-trump-covid19-5caad69c-f6d4-4b79-bfb4-7b6ed038bc5b.html\">the largest single drop in international student migration in American history<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Why does that matter? In the U.S. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.insidehighered.com\/quicktakes\/2017\/10\/11\/foreign-students-and-graduate-stem-enrollment\">according to relatively recent data<\/a>, 81% of electrical engineering grad students are international, 79% in computer science are, and in most engineering and technical fields, the number hovers above a majority.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s great to believe the fantasy that if only these international grad students would stay home, then \u201creal\u201d Americans would somehow take these slots. But what\u2019s true of the strawberry pickers and food service workers is also true for EE grad students: proverbial \u201cAmericans\u201d don\u2019t want these jobs. They are hard jobs, thankless jobs, and require a ridiculous tenacity that American workers and students by and large don\u2019t have. These industries have huge contingents of foreign workers precisely because no one domestic wants to take these roles.<\/p>\n<p>So goes the talent, so goes the innovation. Without this wellspring of brainpower lodging itself in America\u2019s top innovation hubs, where exactly do we think it will go? That former aspiring Stanford or MIT computer scientist with ideas in his or her brain isn\u2019t just going to sit by the window gazing at the horizon waiting for the moment when they can enter the gilded halls of the U.S. of A. It\u2019s the internet era, and they are just going to get started on their dreams wherever they are, using whatever tools and resources they have available to them.<\/p>\n<p>All you have to do is look at the recent YC batches and realize that the future cohorts of great startups are going to increasingly come from outside the continental 48. Dozens of smart, brilliant entrepreneurs aren\u2019t even trying to migrate, instead rightfully seeing their home markets as more open to innovation and technological progress than the vaunted superpower. The frontier is closed here, and it has moved elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>So what are we left with here in the U.S. and increasingly Europe? A narrow-minded policy of blocking external tech innovation to ensure that our sclerotic and entrenched incumbents don\u2019t have to compete with the best in the world. If that isn\u2019t a recipe for economic disaster, I don\u2019t know what is.<\/p>\n<p>But hey: at least the youth will be patriotic.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It used to be \u201ceasy\u201d to tell the American and Chinese economies apart.

developers with an 85\/15 split<\/a> on revenue from customers that remain subscribed for more than a year \u2014 subscription monetization and retention has felt like the Holy Grail for app developers. So much so that <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/googleplay\/android-developer\/answer\/112622?hl=en\">Google quickly followed suit<\/a>\u00a0in what appeared to be an example of healthy competition for developers in the mobile OS duopoly.<\/p>\n<p>But how does that split actually work out for most apps? Turns out, the 85\/15 split \u2014 which Apple is keen to mention anytime developers complain about the App Store rev share \u2014 doesn\u2019t have a meaningful impact for most developers. Because churn.<\/p>\n<p>No matter how great an app is, subscribers are going to churn. Sometimes it\u2019s because of a credit card expiring or some other billing issue. And sometimes it\u2019s more of a pause, and the user comes back after a few months. But the majority of churn comes from subscribers who, for whatever reason, decide that the app just isn\u2019t worth paying for anymore. If a subscriber churns before the one-year mark, the developer never sees that 85% split. And even if the user resubscribes, Apple and Google reset the clock if a subscription has lapsed for more than 60 days. Rather convenient\u2026 for Apple and Google.<\/p>\n<p>Top mobile apps like Netflix and Spotify report churn rates in the low single digits, but they are the outliers. According to our data, the median churn rate for subscription apps is around\u00a013% for monthly subscriptions\u00a0and around 50% for annual. Monthly subscription churn is generally a bit higher in the first few months, then it tapers off. But an average churn of 13% leaves just 20% of subscribers crossing that magical 85\/15 threshold.<\/p>\n<p>In practice, what this means is that, for all the hype around the 85\/15 split, very few developers are going to see a meaningful increase in revenue:<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2048964\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img

Yang and Sonny Vu discuss COVID-19\u2019s impact on tech manufacturing"},"content":{"rendered":"<p class=\"p1\">Like most of the rest of the world, COVID-19 hit the manufacturing sector by surprise. That China \u2014 which continues to comprise the vast majority of electronics manufacturing \u2014 was the first global epicenter of the virus certainly didn\u2019t help the industry sufficiently brace for the impact of a pandemic on a scale the world has not seen for more than a century.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cNobody had a great reaction,\u201d <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/anker-2\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"anker-2\">Anker <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> founder and CEO Steven Yang concedes during our Disrupt interview. \u201cI think this all caught us by surprise. In our China office, everybody was prepared to go on vacation for the Chinese New Year. I think the first reaction was that vacation was prolonged the first week and then another several days. People were just off work. There wasn\u2019t a determined date for when they could come back to work. That period was the most concerning because we didn\u2019t have an outlook. They had to find certainties. People had to work from home and contact supplies and so forth. That first three to four weeks was the most chaotic.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The impact of the earliest days of the pandemic continues to have knock-on effects that have sent shockwaves throughout the global hardware industry. In early 2020, it was easy enough for many throughout the globe to write off the novel coronavirus as the latest in a string of outbreaks that didn&#8217;t move too far beyond select pockets. Ultimately, however, it would bring much of the world to a screeching halt.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">Manufacturing, in particular, suffered first from a workplace depletion. Soon, the hamstringing of its supply was outpaced in lowered demand. Economic recessions and skyrocketing unemployment have torpedoed consumer demand for a number of electronics (and in many sectors that continues). While it\u2019s true that some categories<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>\u2014 like PCs \u2014 ultimately benefited from the shift in lifestyles, an overall decrease in disposable income has had a profound impact on the industry.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">On the manufacturing side, COVID-19 has served to propel existing trends. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s accelerated this depolarization to some extent,\u201d <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/arevo-labs\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"arevo-labs\">Arevo <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> CEO <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/sonny-vu\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"sonny-vu\">Sonny Vu <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> explains. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing across the board soft goods, hardware.\u201d Vu, who spends much of his time in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, notes that the advent of COVID-19 has increased the appeal of manufacturing sites outside of China. Areas like South East Asia and India, which are continuing to increase in popularity as manufacturing hot beds, are becoming increasingly appealing for those looking to diversify sites to help prepare for similar issues in the future.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Robotics and automation is another key category seeing increased potential acceleration, as manufacturers look toward streamlining processes that can\u2019t call in sick or increase transmission of human viruses.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIt\u2019s our firm belief that automation will not only be efficient, but effective. We have invested heavily in robotic automation,\u201d says Yang. \u201cIt\u2019s to a certain point \u2014 because if you were to take a certain wire and push it through a hole, the cost of a robot that does that is still, I don\u2019t know, 20 years of a single worker\u2019s salary.

class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> has debuted a prototype of what it calls &#8220;U-Shift,&#8221; an urban mobility vehicle designed for multiple uses. U-Shift is a fully electric vehicle, designed for autonomous operation, and could serve in a number of capacities, including as an on-demand shuttle, a bus, a mobile distribution center for package delivery or even as a traveling salesroom.<\/p>\n<p>As you can see from the images, the base of the U-Shift itself is pretty simple, containing the wheels, drive system and batteries. DLR envisions a modular top component that can be swapped out depending on usage needs, with various add-on units depicted, including an airy, all-glass bus, and a more bare-bones cargo capsule.<\/p>\n<p>This modularity could help the U-Shift better address the varied needs of city-based transportation, with the flexibility to shift modes relatively easily depending on what&#8217;s going on at the time. You could easily see how a fleet like this could be repurposed for on-demand package and grocery delivery during lockdowns like the ones that have been required during the COVID-19 pandemic, when personal transportation is less needed.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>[gallery ids=\"2048697,2048700,2048701,2048699,2048698,2048696\"]<\/p>\n<p>This prototype is functional, but it&#8217;s not autonomous &#8212; it&#8217;s remote-controlled instead. The top speed also isn&#8217;t that high, but it is capable of operating continuously for 24 hours when necessary.

noreferrer\">announced<\/a> the details of how it will enforce the shutdown of TikTok and WeChat in the country, after announcing in August plans to do so by September 20 over national security concerns. The news is structured along two dates, September 20 and November 12. Both apps and their app updates will no longer be distributed in U.S. app stores as of September 20. But <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tiktok\">TikTok <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> specifically gets an extension on how it operates until November 12.<\/p>\n<p>That not only keeps it up until after the November 3 U.S. election, but leaves the door open for it to complete a complicated deal with Oracle and partners to take control of its U.S. operations without an interruption in service.<\/p>\n<p>That timing, plus the statement from the Department of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, underscores the strong political current running through the news.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s actions prove once again that President Trump will do everything in his power to guarantee our national security and protect Americans from the threats of the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d said Ross in a statement.\u00a0\u201cAt the President\u2019s direction, we have taken significant action to combat China\u2019s malicious collection of American citizens\u2019 personal data, while promoting our national values, democratic rules-based norms, and aggressive enforcement of U.S. laws and regulations.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The first part of the action, starting September 20, has to do with halting all new app distribution for both <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/we-chat\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"we-chat\">WeChat <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> (owned by Tencent) and TikTok (owned by <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/bytedance\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"bytedance\">ByteDance) <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>. In other words, no new downloads of either app as of September 20, and no new updates. And it also forbids &#8220;a<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">ny provision of services through the\u00a0<\/span>WeChat<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">\u00a0mobile application for the purpose of transferring funds or processing payments within the U.S.&#8221; &#8212; that is, all payments.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>WeChat&#8217;s owner Tencent has issued a response to the announcement:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We are reviewing the latest announcement from the Department of Commerce restricting the use of WeChat by U.S. users,&#8221; said a spokesperson. &#8220;WeChat was designed to serve international users outside of mainland China and has always incorporated the highest standards of user privacy and data security. Following the initial executive order on August 6 we have engaged in extensive discussions with the U.S. government, and have put forward a comprehensive proposal to address its concerns. The restrictions announced today are unfortunate, but given our desire to provide ongoing services to our users in the U.S. \u2014 for whom WeChat is an important communication tool \u2014 we will continue to discuss with the government and other stakeholders in the U.S. ways to achieve a long-term solution.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It seems that the different dates might mean that those that already have TikTok installed by September 20 should still be able to continue using it, even if you&#8217;re an iPhone user updating to iOS 14.<\/p>\n<p>We write &#8220;might&#8221; because the government hasn&#8217;t provided technical detail around how it plans to implement its rules.<\/p>\n<p>From that date, WeChat also will not, seemingly, work at all, with the U.S. forbidding &#8220;any provision of internet hosting services enabling the functioning or optimization,&#8221; any provision of content delivery, internet transit or peering services, or any provision of constituent code, functions or services of the app.<\/p>\n<p>Notably, TikTok will not face the same operational roadblock on September 20.<\/p>\n<p>TikTok has until November 12 before those rules come into play. That is to say, if you have TikTok downloaded by September 20, you will still be able to use it.<\/p>\n<p>The date is important for a couple of reasons. It firstly leaves the app up and running in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election. Many have said that Trump shutting down the popular app &#8212; which has some 100 million users in the U.S., but beyond that a much wider public following in pop culture, where TikToks are shared on national television and across a lot of other social channels &#8212; now could hurt him with younger voters. Whether or not that really would have been the case, this seems to have knocked that problem out of his re-election calculus.<\/p>\n<p>It secondly leaves the door open for Oracle, Walmart and the rest in that consortium negotiating to take over the operation of TikTok to seal their deal without any interruption in service. The app has around <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/tiktok-hits-100m-users-in-europe-as-the-clock-ticks-on-its-us-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">100 million users<\/a> in the country, similar to its number of users in Europe.<\/p>\n<p>The story around the deal has been changing by the day, shifting from an outright acquisition to one where Oracle might control the data in the app but not the source code, to licensing the source code too, to getting China&#8217;s approval as well as that of the U.S., and other permutations. The most <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/09\/17\/technology\/tiktok-deal-revisions-trump-review.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recent developments<\/a> have included the idea of a public listing and even considering Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom to take it over as the new CEO.<\/p>\n<p>Ironic, then, that one of the more outspoken tech leaders around this latest development has been Adam Mosseri, the current head of Instagram, who has been tweeting his thoughts about the wider implications for other big tech companies.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Careful with this headline, the ban is only of *new downloads* of TikTok, an outright ban will happen on 11\/12 unless a deal is made.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve said this before, but a US TikTok ban would be quite bad for Instagram, Facebook, and the internet more broadly. <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/2tPPgAkI4K\">https:\/\/t.co\/2tPPgAkI4K<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Adam Mosseri \ud83d\ude37 (@mosseri) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mosseri\/status\/1306941776733835278?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 18, 2020<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>(We&#8217;ve been in a tit-for-tat war around apps and freedom to operate them across national boundaries for some time already, and many countries with national firewalls have long decided that there is absolutely nothing wrong with prohibiting some apps from other countries if you feel they compromise your national security.)<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce decisions are in line with an executive order signed by President Trump on August 6, which put ByteDance and Tencent, the respective owners of TikTok and WeChat, on notice of the government\u2019s intention to block access to their products over purported concerns about national security.<\/p>\n<p>That executive order precipitated the last few weeks of feverish dealmaking to avoid a shutdown of TikTok, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/tiktok-rumors-beg-the-question-did-trump-solve-anything\/\">discussions that remain ongoing and are not finalized<\/a>. As of today, Oracle and what looks like Walmart are still negotiating with the White House, Treasury Department and ByteDance to come to a deal that will be acceptable to the president. China also has authority to approve a sale of TikTok.<\/p>\n<p>Over the last few weeks, the administration has promoted a policy known as \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.state.gov\/the-clean-network\/\">Clean Network<\/a>\u201d designed to eliminate foreign interference in applications and cloud infrastructure that powers American technology.<\/p>\n<p>That policy calls for the removal of certain apps, data sovereignty to onshore American user data to the United States, mobile network infrastructure built from &#8220;clean&#8221; equipment and a host of other measures to create a &#8220;clean&#8221; computing environment for U.S. citizens. While those policies are generally written broadly, their clear target has been China, based on speeches from administration officials.<\/p>\n<p>TikTok and WeChat are not the only app removals announced overnight. In India, one of the most popular payment apps in the country \u2014 Paytm \u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/18\/google-pulls-indias-paytm-app-from-play-store-for-repeat-policy-violations\/\">has been removed from Google\u2019s Play Store<\/a> for \u201crepeat policy violations.\u201d The app has tens of millions of monthly users. In late June, the country also <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/29\/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps\/\">announced a list of 59 apps developed by Chinese companies<\/a> that would be banned, including TikTok.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"hqPampRUu7\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/18\/google-pulls-indias-paytm-app-from-play-store-for-repeat-policy-violations\/\">Google pulls India&#8217;s Paytm app from Play Store for repeat policy violations<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Google pulls India&#8217;s Paytm app from Play Store for repeat policy violations&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/18\/google-pulls-indias-paytm-app-from-play-store-for-repeat-policy-violations\/embed\/#?secret=hqPampRUu7\" data-secret=\"hqPampRUu7\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Such national fights over the future of technology have increasingly come to a head as tech drives a larger segment of the global economy and increasingly becomes intertwined with competing national interests.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"i0Gx8fKBFl\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/29\/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps\/\">India bans TikTok, dozens of other Chinese apps<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;India bans TikTok, dozens of other Chinese apps&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/29\/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps\/embed\/#?secret=i0Gx8fKBFl\" data-secret=\"i0Gx8fKBFl\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The U.S. Commerce Department has now\u00a0announced the details of how it will enforce the shutdown of TikTok and WeChat in the country, after announcing in August plans to do so by September 20 over national security concerns.

the future, why wouldn&#8217;t they just start companies themselves? That&#8217;s the question <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/hussein-kanji\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"hussein-kanji\">Hussein Kanji, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> founding partner at <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/18\/hoxton-ventures-2\/\">Hoxton Ventures<\/a>, asked rhetorically at Disrupt 2020.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If anyone says that they have predictive power in this industry and says they know where the future is gonna be, I just question the wisdom of this,&#8221; he said during a session exploring how VCs seek out new markets before they even exist. &#8220;Because if you could figure it out, you could come up with the idea, you&#8217;re capable enough to be able to put all the pieces together, why would you not found the business?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Instead, the key to betting on the future is to learn to ask the stupid questions. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s actually perfectly fine in the venture industry to not be the smart person and to kind of train yourself to be stupid and ask the stupid questions,&#8221; said Kanji. &#8220;I think a lot of people are probably too shy to do that. And a lot of people [are] probably too risk averse to then write the check when they don&#8217;t really understand exactly what it is that they&#8217;re investing into. But a lot of this stuff is a light bulb moment.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>One of those light bulb moments was <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/hoxton-ventures\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"hoxton-ventures\">Hoxton Ventures&#8217; <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> investment in Deliveroo, the takeout food delivery service that competes with Uber Eats and helped turn almost every restaurant into a food delivery service. However, Kanji reminded us that the European unicorn wasn&#8217;t the first company to try takeout delivery, but new technology, in the form of cheap smartphones coupled with GPS and routing algorithms, meant the timing was now right.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;People did try delivery,&#8221; he said, &#8220;they tried it back in the 90s. Everyone forgets about that. There&#8217;s a company in New York City called Kozmo that would go off and like get you a pint of ice cream on demand. You know, it never worked because they used pagers. Like, do you remember pagers? Like, that&#8217;s how they ran the fleet. They couldn&#8217;t move the fleet around. They couldn&#8217;t get the driver to the apartment and the driver to the store in any kind of efficient way&#8230; The breakthrough for delivery, and for that whole industry, was you had smartphones, you could give smartphones to the drivers, you could track what the driver was doing, which is good because then you could route logistics, you know, with a smartphone&#8230; light bulb moment.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Kanji said that, although they are very different businesses and markets, Hoxton&#8217;s two other unicorns, Babylon and Darktrace, involved similar light bulb moments. Yet you don&#8217;t get that light bulb moment until someone walks in the door and explains it to you. &#8220;Then your natural question is&#8230; why now&#8230; what&#8217;s actually changed? Like, what makes this so interesting? Why didn&#8217;t someone come up with this a year ago? There&#8217;s almost always usually a reason for that kind of stuff. And then the harder part of the job is&#8230; are you really picking number one?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Entering or helping to create new markets is often not without controversy &#8212; which both <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/25\/first-do-no-harm\/\">Babylon<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/12\/05\/unions-human-rights-challenge-to-deliveroo-dismissed-by-uk-high-court\/\">Deliveroo<\/a> has attracted for different reasons. As real disruption inevitably creates societal consequences, it often raises ethical questions that, the Hoxton co-founder argues, aren&#8217;t always possible to anticipate early on. However, as the picture becomes clearer, he says VCs should absolutely care, along with, of course, founders and CEOs.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the constant criticisms in the tech industry is, I think the maturity of our industry&#8230; we behave more like teenagers. And it&#8217;s great to be libertarian, it&#8217;s great to be free markets and say markets are gonna sort it out. But you&#8217;re gonna have touch points with a lot of other places in society. You&#8217;ve got to figure out, and I think, get ahead in terms of&#8230;what the impact is going to be, and be more responsible.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f5c0f26b65dff2c9a07d8e3\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If venture capitalists could predict the future, why wouldn&#8217;t they just start companies themselves?

href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-44295336\"> the world&#8217;s largest vaping market<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Relx, one of China&#8217;s biggest e-cigarette companies, is seeking to submit its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/tobacco-products\/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product\/premarket-tobacco-product-applications\">Premarket Tobacco Product Application<\/a> to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by the end of 2021. Upon completion of a review process that will take no longer than 180 days, the FDA will take &#8220;action,&#8221; which could be marketing authorization, a request for more information or denial.<\/p>\n<p>The vaping startup has requested a pre-submission meeting with the FDA and is expected to meet with the regulator in October, said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/donald-graff-795a881b\/\">Donald Graff<\/a>, the two-year-old startup&#8217;s head of scientific affairs for North America, appearing in a video during a press event this week in Shenzhen.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Graff had a brief stint at Juuls Labs as its principal scientist after a 13-year streak at clinical research company Celerion where he oversaw tobacco studies. He&#8217;s now spearheading PMTA for Relx. Another scientist from Juuls, Xing Chengyue, who helped invent the nicotine salts critical to e-cigarettes, also joined in China&#8217;s vaping industry and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/27\/myst-labs-profile\/\">founded her own startup Myst<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>PMTA is an extensive, meticulous, costly bureaucratic process for vaping products to establish that they are &#8220;appropriate for the protection of public health&#8221; before being marketed in the U.S. Relx, headquartered in the world&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.euromonitor.com\/smokeless-tobacco-e-vapour-products-and-heated-tobacco-in-china\/report\">e-cigarette manufacturing hub Shenzhen<\/a>, has set up a team to work on the application process, including hiring third-party consulting services and clinical partners to generate data from tests that are necessary for the submission.<\/p>\n<p>All e-cigarette companies currently on the U.S. market needed to submit their PMTA by September 10 this year. To date, no products have received marketing authorization by the FDA.<\/p>\n<p>The high costs of PMTA keep many small players from entering the U.S., but Relx has the financial prowess to bear the expense &#8212; it estimates the entire process will cost it more than $20 million. A Nielson survey Relx commissioned showed that the company had a nearly 70% share of China&#8217;s pod vape market as of April. And the e-cigarette maker is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ifre.com\/story\/2504832\/sequoia-idg-capital-backed-relx-weighs-hk-ipo-l4n2ft14c\">reportedly weighing<\/a> an initial public offering in Hong Kong, but the startup has repeatedly denied the &#8220;rumor&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>As the risks associated with e-cigarettes continue to draw attention from regulators around the world, Relx has ramped up research investments to examine vaping&#8217;s impact on public health. At this week&#8217;s event, its chief executive Kate Wang, a rare female founder of a major tech company in China, and previously the general manager of Uber China, highlighted &#8220;science&#8221; as a key focus at her startup.<\/p>\n<p>Recently unveiled is the company&#8217;s Shenzhen-based bioscience lab, which is measuring the effects of Relx vapors through in vivo and in vitro tests, as well as conducting pre-clinical safety assessments.<\/p>\n<p>Despite its ongoing efforts to prove the benefit of switching from smoking to vaping, Relx alongside its rivals faces regulatory uncertainties across various markets. The Trump administration <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/09\/11\/trump-administration-is-readying-tighter-regulations-on-e-cigarettes-including-ban-on-flavorings\/\">banned flavored vape products <\/a>last year (Relx plans to submit unflavored products for FDA review) and India <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/09\/18\/india-bans-e-cigarettes-citing-youth-health-concerns\/\">banned e-cigarettes<\/a>, citing adverse health impacts on youth.<\/p>\n<p>When asked how the startup plans to cope with changing policies, a Relx executive said at the event that &#8220;the company keeps a good relationship with regulators from various countries.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t make conclusions on something that is still in the process,&#8221; said the executive, referring to the early stage of the vaping industry.<\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The backlash against vaping in the United States has not deterred a Chinese challenger from entering the world&#8217;s largest vaping market.

Its marquee app, which competes with Google Pay in India, disappeared from the Play Store in the country earlier Friday.<\/p>\n<p>Google said that Play Store prohibits online casinos and other unregulated gambling apps that facilitate sports betting in India. Paytm, which has promoted a fantasy sports service within its marquee app, repeatedly violated Play Store&#8217;s policies, two people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. Paytm&#8217;s fantasy sports service, called Paytm First Games, was also available as a standalone app, which has been pulled from the Play Store, too.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The Android-maker, which maintains similar guidelines around gambling in most other markets, additionally noted that if an app leads consumers to an external website that allows them to participate in paid tournaments to win real money or cash prizes it will also be deemed in violation of its Play Store policies.<\/p>\n<p>In an email Google sent to many firms in India, and reviewed by TechCrunch, the company asked developers to pause all advertising campaigns in their apps to drive users to websites that offer installation files of sports betting apps.<\/p>\n<p>Google&#8217;s Pay app\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/03\/google-and-walmarts-phonepe-establish-dominance-in-indias-mobile-payments-market-as-whatsapp-pay-struggles-to-launch\/\">currently dominates the payments market<\/a>\u00a0in India, and Android commands about 99% of the smartphone market share in the country.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Dear Paytm&#39;ers,<\/p>\n<p>Paytm Android app is temporarily unavailable on Google&#39;s Play Store for new downloads or updates.

When an app violates these policies, we notify the developer of the violation and remove the app from Google Play until the developer brings the app into compliance,\u201d wrote Suzanne Frey, vice president, Product, Android Security and Privacy, in a blog post.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnd in the case where there are repeated policy violations, we may take more serious action which may include terminating Google Play Developer accounts. Our policies are applied and enforced on all developers consistently,\u201d she added.<\/p>\n<p>In a televised interview with CNBC TV18,\u00a0Paytm co-founder and chief executive <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/vijay-shekhar-sharma\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"vijay-shekhar-sharma\">Vijay Shekhar Sharma <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> accused Google of not allowing Paytm to acquire new users.<\/p>\n<p>He acknowledged that Google had reached out to Paytm before and raised concerns about Paytm First Games, but the incident with Paytm&#8217;s main app, he said, is over &#8220;nothing but&#8221; paying cash back to customers.<\/p>\n<p>The cashbacks were issued in ways of cricket-themed scratch cards, he said, adding that if Paytm isn&#8217;t allowed to issue cashback to customers, the same rule should be applied to every player. Google Pay, as well as Walmart&#8217;s PhonePe, give customers similar incentives in India.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is the problem of India&#8217;s app ecosystem. So many founders have reached out to us&#8230; if we believe this country can build digital business, we must know that it is at somebody else&#8217;s hand to bless that business and not this country&#8217;s rules and regulations,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>In an interview with TechCrunch, Madhur Deora, president of Paytm, said Google did not raise any issue about Paytm First Games app today. He said Paytm had rolled out the cricket-themed sticker for cashbacks early Friday. Hours later Google raised objection about it and suspended the app. He said the company had pulled the new feature and submitted the revised version of the app to the Google Play Store.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the\u00a0Federation of Indian Fantasy Sports (FIFS), an &#8220;industry body&#8221; that represents some fantasy sports firms, claims it complained to Google to take action on companies that distribute or promote fantasy sports through Play Store.<\/p>\n<p>Dream Sports, the parent firm of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/indian-fantasy-sports-app-dream11s-parent-firm-raises-225m-at-over-2-5b-valuation\/\">India&#8217;s most popular fantasy sports app Dream 11<\/a>, is the founding member of FIFS.

data-entity=\"grabtaxi\">Grab <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> delivery<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Ride-hailing services around the world have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.grab.com\/\">Grab<\/a> was no exception. The company is one of the most highly-valued tech startups in Southeast Asia, where it operates in eight countries. Its transport business suffered a sharp decline in March and April, as movement restriction orders were implemented.<\/p>\n<p>But the company had the advantage of already operating several on-demand logistics services. During Disrupt, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/russell-cohen\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"russell-cohen\">Russell Cohen, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Grab\u2019s group managing director of operations, talked about how the company adapted its technology for an unprecedented crisis (the video is embedded below).<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;We sat down as a leadership group at the start of the crisis and we could see, particularly in Southeast Asia, that the scale of the challenge was so immense,&#8221; said Cohen.<\/p>\n<p>Grab\u2019s driver app already allowed them to toggle between ride-hailing and on-demand delivery requests. As a result of COVID-19, more than 149,000 drivers began performing on-demand deliveries for the first time, with Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand seeing the most conversions. That number included tens of thousands of new drivers who joined the platform to make up for lost earnings during the pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>The challenge was scaling up its delivery services to meet the dramatic increase in demand by consumers, and also merchants who needed a new way to reach customers. In March and April, Cohen said just under 80,000 small businesses joined its platform. Many had never sold online before, so Grab expedited the release of a self-service feature, making it easier for merchants to on-board themselves.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a massive sector of the Southeast Asian economy that effectively digitized within a matter of weeks,\u201d said Cohen.<\/p>\n<p>A lot of the new merchants had previously taken only cash payments, so Grab had to set them up for digital payments, a process made simpler because the company&#8217;s financial unit, Grab Financial, already offers services like Grab Pay for cashless payments, mobile wallets and remittance services.<\/p>\n<p>Grab also released a new package of tools called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.grab.com\/sg\/merchant\/food\/\">Grab Merchant<\/a>, which enabled merchants to set up online businesses by submitting licenses and certification online, and includes features like data analytics.<\/p>\n<h3>Modeling for uncertainty in the &#8220;new normal&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p>Part of Grab\u2019s COVID-19 strategy involved collaborating with local municipalities and governments in different countries to make deliveries more efficient. For example, it worked with the Singaporean government to expand a pilot program, called<a href=\"https:\/\/www.grab.com\/sg\/press\/others\/grab-announces-additional-covid-19-support-measures\/\"> GrabExpress Car<\/a>, originally launched in September, that enabled more of Grab\u2019s ride-hailing vehicles to be used for food and grocery deliveries. Previously, many of those deliveries were handled only by motorbikes.<\/p>\n<p>The situation in each of Grab\u2019s markets &#8212; Singapore, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam &#8212; is still evolving. Some markets have lifted lockdown orders, while others continue to cope with new outbreaks.<\/p>\n<p>Cohen said ride-hailing is gradually recovering in many of Grab\u2019s markets. But the company is preparing for an uncertain future by modeling different scenarios, taking into account potential re-closings, and long-lasting changes in both consumer and merchant behavior.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUnpredictability is something we think a lot about,\u201d Cohen said. Its models include ones where deliveries are a significantly larger part of its business, because even in countries where movement restrictions have been lifted, customers still prefer to shop online.<\/p>\n<p>COVID-19 has also accelerated the adoption of digital payments in several of Grab&#8217;s markets. For example, Grab <a href=\"https:\/\/www.grab.com\/ph\/press\/tech-product\/grab-everything-online-grab-releases-digital-first-grabpay-card-in-the-philippines-powered-by-mastercard\/\">launched its GrabPay Card in the Philippines three months ago<\/a>, because more people are beginning to use contactless payments in response to COVID-19 concerns.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of on-demand deliveries, the company is expanding GrabExpress, its same-day courier service, and adapting technology originally created for ride-pooling to help drivers plan pickups and deliveries more efficiently. This will help decrease the cost of delivery services as consumers remain price-conscious because of the pandemic&#8217;s economic impact.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPurchasing behaviors have changed, so for us, when we think about the supply side, the drivers\u2019 side, that means we\u2019ve got to make sure our fleet is flexible,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f5c0f26ae62e42c37634fcd\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ride-hailing services around the world have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, and Grab was no exception.

A month later, Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed the development, adding that Apple will also launch its first physical store in the country next year.<\/p>\n<p>On its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/in\/apple-store-online\/\">website<\/a>, Apple says it also plans to offer financing options to customers in India, and students will receive additional discounts on Apple products and accessories. Starting next month, it will also let customers check out free online sessions on music and photography from professional creatives.

The company declined to comment, but a source with knowledge of the matter confirmed the details with TechCrunch.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>There are intricacies in the claim of &#8220;500 million orders.&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t exclude canceled orders or refunds, and Kuaishou won&#8217;t reveal what its actual sales were. The company also said the number made it China&#8217;s fourth-largest e-commerce player following Alibaba, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/jd-com\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"jd-com\">JD.com <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/pinduoduo\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"pinduoduo\">Pinduoduo <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to verify the claim as there are no comparable figures from these firms during the period, but let&#8217;s work with what&#8217;s available. Pinduoduo previously <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/earnings\/call-transcripts\/2019\/08\/21\/pinduoduo-inc-pdd-q2-2019-earnings-call-transcript.aspx\">said<\/a> it logged more than 7 billion orders in the first six months of 2019. That means it averaged 1.16 billion orders per month, more than doubling Kuaishou&#8217;s volume.<\/p>\n<p>Kuaishou&#8217;s figure, however, does indicate that many users have bought or at least considered buying through its video platform.<\/p>\n<p>The app, known for its celebration of <a href=\"https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/pdf\/10.1177\/2056305119883430\">vernacular and even mundane<\/a> user content, boasts 300 million daily active users at the latest, which suggests on average its users made at least one order during the month. Many of the products sold were produce grown by its large base of rural users.

class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> joined us to talk about a variety of issues. Among them, we discussed how he&#8217;s putting his stamp on <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/benchmark\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"benchmark\">Benchmark <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> now that, 15 years after joining the storied firm, he&#8217;s its <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/22\/report-bill-gurley-is-stepping-away\/\">most senior member<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Fenton said that he&#8217;s mostly focused on ensuring that the firm doesn&#8217;t change. It wants to remain small, with no more than six general partners at a time. It wants to keep investing funds that are half a billion dollars or less because its small team can only work closely with so many founders. He also made a point of noting that Benchmark&#8217;s partners still divide their investment profits equally, unlike at other, more hierarchical venture firms, where senior investors reap the biggest financial benefits.<\/p>\n<p>We also talked about diversity because Benchmark &#8212; which is currently run by Fenton, Sarah Tavel, Eric Vishria and Chetan Puttagunta &#8212; is hiring one to two more general partners.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>We talked about the opportunities that has Benchmark, and Fenton specifically, most excited right now.<\/p>\n<p>And we talked about why Benchmark, a Series A investor in both <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/uber\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"uber\">Uber <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and WeWork, seemingly took so long to address cultural issues within both companies. Read on for more, or check out our full conversation below.<\/p>\n<p><strong>On whether Benchmark, which historically had all white male partners and now counts Fenton as its only white male partner, might hire a Black partner on his watch, given the dearth of Black investors in the industry (along with the changing demographics of the U.S.):<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a personal issue for me, which is going to be measured in the outcomes, just like we have companies that take on initiatives that matter and then measure them and hold themselves accountable. I won&#8217;t feel good about our failure if we don&#8217;t continue to tilt towards diversity. It&#8217;s not enough that I&#8217;m the only white male partner. The industry is so systematically skewed in the wrong direction, and we&#8217;ve gotten so good at rationalizing how it ended up here, that I don&#8217;t think we can tolerate it anymore.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Benchmark is looking to reinvent itself through &#8220;three interfaces,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;It&#8217;s who are we talking with and spending time with in terms of [who we might invest in] &#8212; that has to change; who are the people making investment decisions, [meaning] the partnership; and then what&#8217;s the composition of the companies we&#8217;ve invested in, meaning the executives and the boards.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Before I&#8217;m done with the venture business, I want to be able to point to empirical outcomes . . .&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>As for why Benchmark waited for the public to rally against its portfolio companies Uber and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/wework-857c\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"wework-857c\">WeWork <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> before taking action to address cultural issues (in Uber&#8217;s case, in reaction to former engineer Susan Fowler&#8217;s famous blog post and, in the case if WeWork, in reaction to its S-1 filing):<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t give you a crisp answer because ultimately, what happens in the public eye isn&#8217;t the whole story of what was going on between Benchmark and those CEOs.&#8221; It&#8217;s &#8220;far more complicated, far more nuanced, far more engaged.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Said Fenton: &#8220;What you start with in any partnership is this idea that we&#8217;re all flawed and providing what feels like unconditional support to a founder to nurture them and help them to understand in ways they might be able to from their direct reports where they are going to get in trouble, where they&#8217;re going to fall short, and then buttress them.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I can say, having watched both [Benchmark investors] Bruce [Dunlevie] and Bill [Gurley] in those roles that they gave their heart and soul to enable the full potential of those entrepreneurs, and in each case, it wasn&#8217;t enough.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to say other than, I don&#8217;t envision another individual in that [board] role being able to do a better job because what they gave was everything, and those companies built enormous organizations, great success, delight and joy for customers, and they had, in each of their cases, pathologies in their culture. A number of companies that I&#8217;m involved with have pathologies in their culture. Every organization can build them. What motivated both Bill and Bruce was the constituencies that go beyond the CEO, the employees, the customers, and in the case of Uber, the drivers . . .<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You could say Susan Fowler was the reason it all happened; I can assure you that the work that was being done far preceded that. Could we have done more, more quickly? You always look back and say, &#8216;Yeah.&#8217; I think you learn as an organization. We&#8217;re not perfect.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>As for the trends that Fenton is watching most closely right now, he suggested a world of opportunities have opened up in the last six months, and he thinks they&#8217;ll only gain momentum from here:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;What I&#8217;m most excited about is, we&#8217;re not going back to normal. What&#8217;s so amazing is this shock to the system is really a <em>big<\/em> opportunity for entrepreneurs to come and say, &#8216;What do we need to build to recreate and unlock all these things we lost when we stopped going into workplaces?&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;So I think this opportunity to build the tools for a world that&#8217;s &#8216;post place&#8217; has just opened up and is as exciting as anything I&#8217;ve seen in my venture career. You walk around right now and you see these ghosts towns, with gyms, classes you might take [and so forth] and now maybe you go online and do Peloton, or that class you maybe do online. So I think a whole field of opportunities will move into this post-place delivery mechanism that are really exciting. [It] could be 10 to 20 years of innovation that just got pulled forward into today.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f63c18353fd6e6a449b93cf\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Earlier today at TechCrunch Disrupt, venture capitalist Peter Fenton joined us to talk about a variety of issues.

It was good fun, though of course we&#8217;re looking forward to bringing the live show back to the conference next year, vaccine allowing.<\/p>\n<p>Thankfully we had <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cgates123\">Chris Gates<\/a> behind the scenes tweaking the dials, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/verdadsanaa?lang=en\">Alexandra Ames<\/a> fitting us into the program and some folks to watch live.<\/p>\n<p>What did we talk about? All of this (and some very, very bad jokes):<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Great American SPAC-Off: As <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/15\/opendoor-to-go-public-by-way-of-chamath-palihapitiya-spac\/\">both Opendoor<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/15\/kleiner-prints-gold-with-desktop-metal-netting-a-roughly-10x-return\/\">Desktop Metal approach<\/a> the public markets on the wings of SPACs, we ask why. And why we have to keep talking about SPACs, which we do not want to do.<\/li>\n<li>But the public markets are hot and active, with companies like JFrog and Snowflake going public to great effect. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/jfrog-and-snowflakes-aggressive-ipo-pricing-point-to-strong-demand-for-cloud-shares\/\">JFrog had a great IPO<\/a>. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/go-public-now-while-software-valuations-make-no-sense-part-ii\/\">Snowflake had an\u00a0<em>insane<\/em> IPO<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>But there was a lot of action from the private markets as well, including <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/airtable-raises-185m-and-launches-new-low-code-and-automation-features\/\">Airtable raising $185 million<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/making-sense-of-3-edtech-extension-rounds\/\">ApplyBoard raised a $55 million\u00a0<em>extension<\/em><\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/connected-fitness-startup-tonal-raises-another-110-million\/\">Tonal raised $110 million<\/a>, because connected fitness is hotter than SaaS at the moment.<\/li>\n<li>We also riffed on <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/11\/as-covid-19-era-drags-on-vcs-look-beyond-zoom-calls-for-due-diligence-and-sourcing\/\">Natasha&#8217;s venture trends&#8217; piece<\/a>, digging into how to get to conviction in a remote-only world. As it turns out, we have notes on video games.<\/li>\n<li>And there were two new funds, including one <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/15\/the-chainsmokers-just-closed-their-debut-venture-fund-mantis-with-35-million\/\">from the Chainsmokers<\/a> (hot, fun, great) and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-09-15\/greylock-partners-raises-1-billion-for-venture-capital-fund?sref=gni836kR\">another from Greylock<\/a> (traditional, Victorian and <em>huge).<\/em> In more serious commentary, the Greylock raise continues the mega-fund era.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And then we tried to play a game that may or may not make it into the final cut. Either way, it was great to have Equity back at Disrupt. More to come.

And the price hasn&#8217;t been a deterrent, he said: &#8220;As an industrial tool this is actually quite affordable. But we&#8217;ve been very aggressive, spending a lot of money to try to build an affordable way to produce this, and we&#8217;re already working on ways to continue to reduce costs.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1885976\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/boston-dynamics-spot.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1885976\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1885976\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/boston-dynamics-spot.jpg\" alt=\"boston dynamics spot\" width=\"1024\" height=\"699\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/boston-dynamics-spot.jpg 3000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/boston-dynamics-spot.jpg?resize=150,102 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/boston-dynamics-spot.jpg?resize=300,205 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/boston-dynamics-spot.jpg?resize=768,524 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/boston-dynamics-spot.jpg?resize=680,464 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/boston-dynamics-spot.jpg?resize=1536,1048 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/boston-dynamics-spot.jpg?resize=2048,1397 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/boston-dynamics-spot.jpg?resize=50,34 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-1885976\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> TechCrunch<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The global pandemic has also helped create a sense of urgency around robots as an alternative to or augmentation of manual labor.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;People are realizing that having a physical proxy for themselves, to be able to be present remotely, might be more important than we imagined before,&#8221; Playter said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve always thought of robots as being able to go into dangerous places, but now danger has been redefined a little bit because of COVID.

But Playter was keen to note that the Japanese tech giant understands that &#8220;we&#8217;re only in the position we&#8217;re in now because of the previous work we&#8217;ve done in the last two decades, developing these advanced capabilities, so we have to keep doing that.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>One thing you won&#8217;t likely see doing real work any time soon is Atlas, the company&#8217;s astonishingly agile humanoid robot.

Grazer (whose films with Howard include &#8220;Apollo 13,&#8221; &#8220;A Beautiful Mind&#8221; and the upcoming &#8220;Hillbilly Elegy&#8221; for Netflix) recalled the Hollywood of 25 years ago, which he described as an &#8220;opaque&#8221; system where original writers often struggled to break in, and he felt that Impact could &#8220;democratize access to Hollywood.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;How can we create opportunity to have access to the epicenter of employment in the media business, which is Hollywood?&#8221; he said.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>For starters, Mitchell described what he claimed is a scalable system for evaluating 2,000 script submissions every week.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We were able to build a system that leverages both technology as well as expert systems evaluating not just the writers, but the readers \u2014 almost like financial analysts \u2014 and try to come up with metrics in a world where there aren&#8217;t stats,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Mitchell also noted that in Impact&#8217;s first cohort of 87 writers, 39% were BIPOC, 10% were LGBTQ and it was split 50-50 between men and women, with 11 different countries represented.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If you try to find the most talented writers in the world, they\u2019re going to look like the world,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Howard made a similar point, saying that this diversity results from an interest in &#8220;fresh new voices&#8221; with &#8220;no statistical goals or agendas in mind &#8212; it&#8217;s just happening in a really honest way.&#8221; (At the same time, interviewer Ingrid Lunden couldn&#8217;t help but observe that this was a panel of three white men discussing diversity.)<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"qFzkw3iXWE\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/impact-a-yc-style-accelerator-for-the-entertainment-industry-spins-out-from-imagine-entertainment-with-backing-from-benchmark\/\">Impact, a YC-style accelerator for the entertainment industry, spins out from Imagine Entertainment with backing from Benchmark<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Impact, a YC-style accelerator for the entertainment industry, spins out from Imagine Entertainment with backing from Benchmark&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/impact-a-yc-style-accelerator-for-the-entertainment-industry-spins-out-from-imagine-entertainment-with-backing-from-benchmark\/embed\/#?secret=qFzkw3iXWE\" data-secret=\"qFzkw3iXWE\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Asked whether they&#8217;re interested in finding new talent from social media, Howard pointed to Grazer as the one who&#8217;s always encouraging him to &#8220;know what&#8217;s going on up north&#8221; (a.k.a. in Silicon Valley).<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Right now we\u2019re in a creative renaissance with podcasts and Instagrams &#8230;\u00a0finding their way into the center of the narrative,&#8221; Howard said.<\/p>\n<p>Grazer said he often looks at YouTube, in particular. At the same time, he cautioned that creating content for these online platforms requires a different skill set than writing movies or TV.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It doesn\u2019t reduce the likelihood of their success necessarily, but it\u2019s a different art form,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Because writing a teleplay or a screenplay, even the greatest playwrights can\u2019t do that particular thing \u2014 you have to be trained.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Still, Imagine found at least one idea in an Instagram Story, developing a comedic show around an actor (Grazer didn&#8217;t want to say who it is, but it&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/film\/2020\/apr\/05\/coronavirus-arnold-schwarzenegger-whiskey-lulu-tees\">probably Arnold Schwarzenegger<\/a>) with a donkey named Lulu and a miniature horse named Whiskey. Apparently the show has attracted multiple bidders, and as for where it will end up, Grazer said, &#8220;It sort of seems like Amazon. I&#8217;ll let you know tomorrow.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f63a2c9ddb6614e940d36f7\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Impact Creative Systems (formerly Imagine Impact) is bringing a startup accelerator-style approach to finding fresh creative talent, and it announced this morning that, with funding from venture capital firm Benchmark, \u00a0it&#8217;s spinning out from Imagine Entertainment &#8212; the production company founded by director Ron Howard and producer Brian Grazer.

class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.cloudflare.com\/what-its-like-to-launch-at-techcrunch-disrupt\/\">launched<\/a> at one of our early events 10 years ago, most investors sure thought its idea was a bit out there. Today, Cloudflare co-founder Michelle Zatlyn joined us at our virtual Disrupt event to talk with our enterprise reporter Ron Miller about those early days and how the team managed to get investors on board with its plan.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Sometimes I think back and I think, what were we thinking? But really, I hope &#8212; as other entrepreneurs listen &#8212; that you do think, &#8216;hey, how can I be more bold?&#8217; Because actually, that&#8217;s where a lot of greatness comes from,&#8221; Zatlyn said.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s maybe no surprise then that she found that when the team went to the Bay Area in the summer of 2009, trying to sell a product that democratized a service that was previously only available to the internet giants of that time, not everybody was ready.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;A lot of eyes glazed over,&#8221; she said. They kind of brushed us aside because we really had a big vision &#8212; we certainly did not lack in vision. So that was a lot of the conversations, but there were some conversations where people really leaned in and they&#8217;re like: &#8216;Oh, wow, tell me more.&#8217; And maybe they knew a lot about cybersecurity or maybe they were really worried about the democratization of the internet and going behind guarded walls. And those people really got excited. And that&#8217;s how we found kind of our initial investors or initial teammates.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"dMU9ynxcY5\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2010\/09\/27\/cloudflare-wants-to-be-a-cdn-for-the-masses-and-takes-five-minutes-to-set-up\/\">CloudFlare Wants To Be A CDN For The Masses (And Takes Five Minutes To Set Up)<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;CloudFlare Wants To Be A CDN For The Masses (And Takes Five Minutes To Set Up)&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2010\/09\/27\/cloudflare-wants-to-be-a-cdn-for-the-masses-and-takes-five-minutes-to-set-up\/embed\/#?secret=dMU9ynxcY5\" data-secret=\"dMU9ynxcY5\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Over time, the team found investors and an initial set of employees, but it wasn&#8217;t easy. &#8220;It was bold then and not everyone thought it was a good idea. Some people looked at us like we&#8217;re crazy, but I&#8217;d like to say that when people look at you like you&#8217;re crazy, you&#8217;re probably onto something big.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>While a lot of people looked at Cloudflare as a CDN in its early days, it was always meant to be a security product that needed the CDN to work (the company sometimes describes itself as an &#8220;accidental CDN&#8221; because of that). Ten years ago, the focus was mostly on web spammers, and because that was something everybody could relate to, it made its ability to combat that very explicit in its pitch deck.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We literally had a slide in our pitch deck that had quotes from real-life IT administrators from some medium-sized businesses, small businesses and developers, explaining in their own words &#8212; and their very hard-hitting words &#8212; how much they despise like these cyber threats that were online. [&#8230;] Even if you knew nothing about cybersecurity or global performance, you could all understand wow, there&#8217;s something here, right?&#8221; And of course, it helped that there was no real protection against these threats available at the time.<\/p>\n<p>Still, getting early customers didn&#8217;t come easy, either, Zatlyn noted, because some just didn&#8217;t understand what the company was doing. But the team took that as feedback and improved how it explained itself.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Early on as an entrepreneur, you got to try a lot of things. And you don&#8217;t need to know every single corner of your business, but you need to really have a high rate of learning. Actually, that&#8217;s an entrepreneur&#8217;s best friend. How fast can you learn, how fast can you take the feedback and iterate on it?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>You can watch the rest of the conversation, including Zatlyn&#8217;s thoughts about going public, below:<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f63acaa53fd6e6a449b56ce\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s not easy getting funding for any startup, but when Cloudflare launched at one of our early events 10 years ago, most investors sure thought its idea was a bit out there.

For Hart, the partnership is one of many relationships with brands and startups, but fits into his own lifestyle and thus made a lot of sense for him to work with, he says.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">&#8220;[A company I invest in] has to coincide with myself and my lifestyle. If I&#8217;m going to talk about it, I have to be true to it,&#8221; Hart told TechCrunch. &#8220;There&#8217;s a plethora of things that I&#8217;m involved with that people would be shocked to know I was a part of, but it&#8217;s because I have the eyesight for it and a love for it.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The Fabletics menswear line that Hart has advertised, and served as a brand spokesman for, has seen major growth amid a broader spike in athleisure wear sales. Goldenberg is bullish on just how much growth Fabletics will see from its men&#8217;s line so early in its life cycle.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a big goal, but I think we could do $75-100 million in sales next year with Fabletics Men, which is our first full year with this line, which would be very, very fast growth,&#8221; Goldenberg says.<\/p>\n<p>As the company firms up its offering in activewear, they&#8217;re also keeping an eye on what trends will help them grow. Fabletics has already been building out technology trying to connect online and offline user habits in its stores.
