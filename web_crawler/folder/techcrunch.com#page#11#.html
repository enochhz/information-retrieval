But on this record \u2014 while the government has established that China\u2019s activities raise significant national- security concerns \u2014 it has put in scant little evidence that its effective ban of WeChat for all U.S. users addresses those concerns. And, as the plaintiffs point out, there are obvious alternatives to a complete ban, such as barring WeChat from government devices, as Australia has done, or taking other steps to address data security.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Given the likelihood of a lawsuit proceeding and the immediate damage a ban would have if implemented, the judge initiated a nationwide injunction against implementation of the Commerce Department\u2019s order to ban the app.<\/p>\n<p>Commerce will have a chance to respond to this development, and whether it chooses to edit its order, pursue other avenues through the courts, or just rescind the order entirely, we will see in the coming days.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A few days ago, the U.S. Commerce Department published a series of rules that aimed to block the downloading of TikTok and WeChat by American users, following an executive order signed by President Trump back in August.

Users collected these cricket-themed stickers for sending money to others, or making transactions such as topping up credit on their phone or paying their broadband or electricity bill.<\/p>\n<p>In a statement on Sunday evening, a Google spokesperson said, \u201coffering cashbacks and vouchers alone do not constitute a violation of our Google Play gambling policies\u201d and that Play Store \u201cpolicies are applied and enforced on all developers consistently.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But it\u2019s arguably anything but consistent.<\/p>\n<p>On September 18, Google told Paytm that it had pulled its app for not complying with Play Store\u2019s \u201cgambling policy\u201d as it offered games with \u201cloyalty points.\u201d Paytm said that Google had not expressed any concerns over Paytm\u2019s new marketing campaign prior to its notice on Friday, in which it revealed that Paytm app had been temporarily removed from the Play Store.<\/p>\n<p>But Google itself is running a similar campaign linked to cricket in India, Paytm argues. (Why cricket? Cricket is immensely popular in India and one of the biggest cricket tournaments globally, Indian Premier League, kicked off its latest season on Saturday.)<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2049284\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2049284\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2049284 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"286\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg 3284w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=150,42 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=300,84 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=768,214 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=680,190 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=1536,428 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=2048,571 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=50,14 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2049284\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cricket-themed cashback offered by Paytm (left) and Google Pay (right) in India<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Google Play Store in India has long prohibited apps that promote gambling such as betting on sporting events, and Google has raised concerns about Paytm&#8217;s marquee app promoting Paytm First Games, a fantasy sports app run by Paytm, in the past.<\/p>\n<p>Paytm executives argued that <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/phonepe\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"phonepe\">PhonePe, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> a Walmart-owned payments app in India, also promoted Dream11, the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/indian-fantasy-sports-app-dream11s-parent-firm-raises-225m-at-over-2-5b-valuation\/\">most popular fantasy sports app in the country<\/a>, and got away without any action.<\/p>\n<p>Google also permits fantasy sports app operators &#8212; including Paytm &#8212; to advertise on Search in India.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-theme=\"light\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Where is Google hypocritical?

The removal of Paytm app was only on the grounds of Paytm offering cricket-themed cashback, he claimed. \u201cGoogle is not allowing us to acquire new customers right now. That\u2019s all what this is,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s payments app, Google Pay, competes with Paytm in India. In fact, Google Pay is the largest payments app for peer-to-peer transaction between users in India and holds the largest market share in UPI.<\/p>\n<p>Without identifying any names, Sharma, the poster child of Indian startup ecosystem, claimed that many founders in India have just accepted that it is Google that has the final say on any matter in India &#8212; and not the country\u2019s regulatory agencies.<\/p>\n<p>For Google, which reaches more users than any other company in India and whose Android operating system commands 99% of the local smartphone market, this kind of accusation is exactly what it needs to avoid in the country. The Silicon Valley search and advertising giant has launched a charm offensive in India, including a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/13\/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india\/\">recently commitment to invest $10 billion<\/a> &#8212;\u00a0more than any other American or Chinese technology firm.<\/p>\n<p>The timing for Google&#8217;s parent company, Alphabet, couldn&#8217;t be worse. Google is currently the <a href=\"https:\/\/in.reuters.com\/article\/us-india-google-antitrust-exclusive\/exclusive-google-faces-antitrust-case-in-india-over-payments-app-sources-idUKKBN2331G3\">subject of an antitrust complaint<\/a> in India over an allegation that it has abused its market position to unfairly promote its mobile payments app in the country; and in the U.S., Congress has intimidated that it may pursue antitrust regulatory action against Alphabet and Apple over app store concerns.<\/p>\n<p>In India, Google&#8217;s moves could have a devastating impact on businesses and everyday consumers.<\/p>\n<p>Paytm is not just a payments app. It is also a fully licensed digital bank. And just an eight-hour of absence from the Play Store created a panic among a portion of its users. A source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that Paytm saw several people withdraw their fixed deposit in Paytm Payments Bank on Friday.<\/p>\n<p>Anecdotally, TechCrunch heard of instances where vendors who previously preferred Paytm for accepting money digitally asked their customers to use a different payments method as they had heard that Paytm was \u201cbanned\u201d in India.<\/p>\n<p>Sharma said Google&#8217;s monopoly on Indian app ecosystem is of a magnitude unparalleled elsewhere in the world.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf paying someone and getting a cashback is gambling, then the same rule should be applied to everyone,\u201d said Sharma. \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful that we are standing here at the cusp of an internet revolution in India and we are being sanctioned by companies that are not governed by the law of this country.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If this sentiment gained traction in India it could create challenges for Google&#8217;s future in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. is forcing a Chinese company to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/19\/tiktok-deal-terms\/\">sell stakes to local firms to continue operations in the country<\/a>. In a recent episode of Dithering podcast, Ben Thompson cautioned that Trump administration\u2019s move &#8212; which some have argued is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/08\/18\/opinion\/tiktok-wechat-ban-trump.html\">a long due tit for tat against Chinese companies<\/a> (as China has long prevented U.S. firms from meaningfully operating in the world&#8217;s largest \u00a0internet market) &#8212;\u00a0might encourage\u00a0other open markets to do to American firms what it is doing to TikTok.<\/p>\n<p>Several U.S. tech executives share these concerns.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The problem with this TikTok deal is that the US is the largest player in tech globally.

capitalism and the American theft of Chinese innovation"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">It used to be \u201ceasy\u201d to tell the American and Chinese economies apart. One was innovative, one made clones. One was a free market while the other demanded payments to a political party and its leadership, a corrupt wealth generating scam that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/business\/global\/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html\">by some estimates<\/a> has netted top leaders billions of dollars. One kept the talent borders porous acting as a magnet for the world\u2019s top brains while the other interviewed you in a backroom at the airport before imprisoning you on sedition charges (okay, that might have been both).<\/p>\n<p>The comparison was always facile yes, but it was easy and at least directionally accurate if failing on the specifics.<\/p>\n<p>Now though, the country that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2019\/04\/lithium-ion-batteries-amazon-are-exploding\/587005\/\">exported exploding batteries<\/a> is pioneering quantum computing, while the country that pioneered the internet <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/03\/made-in-america-is-on-government-life-support-and-the-prognosis-isnt-good\/\">now builds planes that fall out of the sky<\/a> (and good news, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/boeing-flags-additional-787-production-problem-11599577936\">we\u2019ve identified even more planes<\/a> that might fall out of the sky at an airport near you!)<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tiktok\">TikTok\u2019s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> success is many things, but it is quite frankly just an embarrassment for the United States. There are thousands of entrepreneurs and hundreds of venture capitalists swarming Silicon Valley and the other American innovation hubs looking for the next great social app or building it themselves. But the power law of user growth and investor returns happens to reside in Haidian, Beijing. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/bytedance\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"bytedance\">ByteDance <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> through its local apps in China and overseas apps like TikTok <i>is<\/i> the consumer investor return of the past decade (there\u2019s a reason why all the IPOs this seasons are enterprise SaaS).<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a win that you can\u2019t chalk up just to industrial policy. Unlike in semiconductors or other capital-intensive industries where Beijing can offer billions in incentives to spur development, ByteDance builds apps. It distributes them on app stores across the world. It has exactly the same tools available to it that every entrepreneur with an Apple Developer account has access to. There is no <a href=\"https:\/\/www.csis.org\/analysis\/made-china-2025\">Made in China 2025<\/a> plan to build and popularize a consumer app like TikTok (you literally can\u2019t plan for consumer success like that). Instead, it\u2019s a well-executed product that\u2019s addictive to hundreds of millions of people.<\/p>\n<p>So much as China protected its industry from overseas competitors like Google and Amazon through market-entry barriers, America is now protecting its entrenched incumbents from overseas competitors like TikTok. We\u2019re demanding joint ventures and local cloud data sovereignty just as the Communist Party has demanded for years.<\/p>\n<p>Hell, we\u2019re apparently demanding a $5 billion tax payment from ByteDance, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-09-20\/trump-wants-5-billion-from-tiktok-deal-for-new-history-project\">which the president says will fund patriotic education for youth<\/a>. The president says a lot of things of course, but at least the $5 billion price point has been confirmed by Oracle in its press release over night (what the tax revenue will <i>actually<\/i> be used for is anyone\u2019s guess). If you followed the recent Hong Kong protests for a long time, you will remember that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-hongkong-patriotism\/hong-kong-frets-over-china-model-patriotic-education-idUSBRE86A09L20120711\">patriotic youth education<\/a> was some of the original tinder for those demonstrations back in 2012. What comes around, goes around, I guess.<\/p>\n<p>Development economists like to talk about \u201ccatch-up\u201d strategies, tactics that countries can take to avoid the middle income trap and cut the gap between the West and the rest. But what we need now are developed economists to explain America\u2019s \u201cfall behind\u201d strategy. Because we are falling behind, in pretty much everything.<\/p>\n<p>As the TikTok process and the earlier Huawei imbroglio show, America is no longer on the leading edge of technology in many key strategic markets. Mainland Chinese companies are globally winning in areas as diverse as 5G and social networks, and without direct government intervention to kill that innovation, American and European tech purveyors would have lost those markets entirely (and even <i>with<\/i> those interventions, they may still lose them). In Taiwan, TSMC has come from behind Intel to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/051b2c80-d53b-410e-8e80-f433d25a82dd\">take a year or two lead<\/a> in the fabrication of the most advanced semiconductors.<\/p>\n<p>I mean, we can\u2019t even pilfer Chinese history and mythology and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/21428088\/mulan-review-disney-live-action-remake\">turn it into a decent god damn film<\/a> these days.<\/p>\n<p>And the fall-behind strategy continues. Immigration restrictions from an administration hell-bent on destroying the single greatest source of American innovation, coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic, have fused into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/international-student-enrollment-trump-covid19-5caad69c-f6d4-4b79-bfb4-7b6ed038bc5b.html\">the largest single drop in international student migration in American history<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Why does that matter? In the U.S. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.insidehighered.com\/quicktakes\/2017\/10\/11\/foreign-students-and-graduate-stem-enrollment\">according to relatively recent data<\/a>, 81% of electrical engineering grad students are international, 79% in computer science are, and in most engineering and technical fields, the number hovers above a majority.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s great to believe the fantasy that if only these international grad students would stay home, then \u201creal\u201d Americans would somehow take these slots. But what\u2019s true of the strawberry pickers and food service workers is also true for EE grad students: proverbial \u201cAmericans\u201d don\u2019t want these jobs. They are hard jobs, thankless jobs, and require a ridiculous tenacity that American workers and students by and large don\u2019t have. These industries have huge contingents of foreign workers precisely because no one domestic wants to take these roles.<\/p>\n<p>So goes the talent, so goes the innovation. Without this wellspring of brainpower lodging itself in America\u2019s top innovation hubs, where exactly do we think it will go? That former aspiring Stanford or MIT computer scientist with ideas in his or her brain isn\u2019t just going to sit by the window gazing at the horizon waiting for the moment when they can enter the gilded halls of the U.S. of A. It\u2019s the internet era, and they are just going to get started on their dreams wherever they are, using whatever tools and resources they have available to them.<\/p>\n<p>All you have to do is look at the recent YC batches and realize that the future cohorts of great startups are going to increasingly come from outside the continental 48. Dozens of smart, brilliant entrepreneurs aren\u2019t even trying to migrate, instead rightfully seeing their home markets as more open to innovation and technological progress than the vaunted superpower. The frontier is closed here, and it has moved elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>So what are we left with here in the U.S. and increasingly Europe? A narrow-minded policy of blocking external tech innovation to ensure that our sclerotic and entrenched incumbents don\u2019t have to compete with the best in the world. If that isn\u2019t a recipe for economic disaster, I don\u2019t know what is.<\/p>\n<p>But hey: at least the youth will be patriotic.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It used to be \u201ceasy\u201d to tell the American and Chinese economies apart.

subscription monetization to more apps in 2016 \u2014 and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2016\/6\/8\/11880730\/apple-app-store-subscription-update-phil-schiller-interview\">enticed developers with an 85\/15 split<\/a> on revenue from customers that remain subscribed for more than a year \u2014 subscription monetization and retention has felt like the Holy Grail for app developers. So much so that <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/googleplay\/android-developer\/answer\/112622?hl=en\">Google quickly followed suit<\/a>\u00a0in what appeared to be an example of healthy competition for developers in the mobile OS duopoly.<\/p>\n<p>But how does that split actually work out for most apps? Turns out, the 85\/15 split \u2014 which Apple is keen to mention anytime developers complain about the App Store rev share \u2014 doesn\u2019t have a meaningful impact for most developers. Because churn.<\/p>\n<p>No matter how great an app is, subscribers are going to churn. Sometimes it\u2019s because of a credit card expiring or some other billing issue. And sometimes it\u2019s more of a pause, and the user comes back after a few months. But the majority of churn comes from subscribers who, for whatever reason, decide that the app just isn\u2019t worth paying for anymore. If a subscriber churns before the one-year mark, the developer never sees that 85% split. And even if the user resubscribes, Apple and Google reset the clock if a subscription has lapsed for more than 60 days. Rather convenient\u2026 for Apple and Google.<\/p>\n<p>Top mobile apps like Netflix and Spotify report churn rates in the low single digits, but they are the outliers. According to our data, the median churn rate for subscription apps is around\u00a013% for monthly subscriptions\u00a0and around 50% for annual. Monthly subscription churn is generally a bit higher in the first few months, then it tapers off. But an average churn of 13% leaves just 20% of subscribers crossing that magical 85\/15 threshold.<\/p>\n<p>In practice, what this means is that, for all the hype around the 85\/15 split, very few developers are going to see a meaningful increase in revenue:<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2048964\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img

to help Americans prepare for the most uncertain election in modern U.S. history.<\/p>\n<p>The platform will add a new &#8220;US Elections&#8221; tab in the Explore menu, where the trending tab and other curated topic lists live. That tab will serve as Twitter&#8217;s central source for hand-picked election news in English and Spanish, debate live streams, state-specific resources and candidate information.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter will also introduce what it&#8217;s calling a series of &#8220;public service announcements&#8221; to educate voters on critical election-related topics. Those PSAs will present information on voter registration, instructions on obtaining a mail-in ballot and suggestions for safe voting as the pandemic continues to rage across the United States.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2046550\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/twitter-election-2020.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"475\" height=\"475\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Twitter wants to empower every eligible person to vote in the 2020 US election, and we\u2019re focused on helping people register, better understand the voting process during COVID-19 including early voting options, and feel informed about the choices on their ballot,&#8221; Twitter Public Policy Director Bridget Coyne and Senior Product Manager Sam Toizer wrote in a blog post on the announcement.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter took a number of measures early on to address concerns around misinformation and platform manipulation around the 2020 election. Unlike Facebook, which has taken more incremental steps, Twitter opted to no longer accept political advertising in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/jack-dorsey-twitter-will-no-longer-accept-political-and-issue-ads\">decision made last October<\/a>. The platform also began aggressively flagging tweets containing election-related misinformation months ago, setting expectations for high-profile serial platform rule-breakers like President Trump.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2046583 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-9.18.41-AM.png?w=595\" alt=\"\" width=\"455\" height=\"520\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-9.18.41-AM.png 596w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-9.18.41-AM.png?resize=131,150 131w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-9.18.41-AM.png?resize=263,300 263w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-9.18.41-AM.png?resize=44,50 44w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 455px) 100vw, 455px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Twitter kicked off a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/27\/twitter-vs-trump-fact-checking-dorsey\/\">political war<\/a> with the president in May when the company added a fact-checking label to a pair of his tweets containing false claims about voter registration and mail-in voting security. In the last month and a half alone, Twitter <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/05\/twitter-trump-campaign-locked-account-team-trump-children-covid\/\">locked the Trump campaign<\/a> out of its Twitter account for sharing a video with the false claim that children are &#8220;almost immune&#8221; to COVID-19, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/23\/twitter-hides-trump-tweet-behind-notice-for-potentially-dissuading-people-from-voting\/\">hid a tweet<\/a> from the president that discouraged voting and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/03\/trump-voting-twice-claim-twitter-facebook-policy\/\">restricted a handful of tweets<\/a> from Trump that encouraged Americans to vote twice, which is illegal.<\/p>\n<p>Last week, in a foreboding sign of what Americans might expect from November&#8217;s election, Twitter <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/10\/twitter-contested-election-misinformation-policy-trump\/\">expanded its misinformation rules<\/a> to address what happens if a candidate declares victory prematurely. In that same update, Twitter also said it would take action against any tweets \u201cinciting unlawful conduct to prevent a peaceful transfer of power or orderly succession.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While Twitter is far from containing its own misinformation problem, it has shown a proactive willingness to adapt to real concerns around the 2020 election, making policy changes on the fly and adjusting those choices somewhat fluidly as needed. By anticipating worst-case scenarios, Twitter will at least be going into the 2020 U.S. elections with its eyes open \u2014 and with so many unknowns in such a tumultuous year, let&#8217;s just hope that&#8217;s enough.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"MZL54wmXHk\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/27\/twitter-vs-trump-fact-checking-dorsey\/\">Jack Dorsey explains why Twitter fact-checked Trump&#8217;s false voting claims<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Jack Dorsey explains why Twitter fact-checked Trump&#8217;s false voting claims&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/27\/twitter-vs-trump-fact-checking-dorsey\/embed\/#?secret=MZL54wmXHk\" data-secret=\"MZL54wmXHk\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/2020-election\/\"><img src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/us-2020-election-footer.png\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Twitter debuted its election hub on Tuesday, introducing a set of tools to help Americans prepare for the most uncertain election in modern U.S. history.

The Apple Watch Series 6 could feature some new tracking abilities, such as oxygen saturation. There should be a big emphasis on sleep tracking as well.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>As for the iPad Air, Apple could unveil a big redesign. The new device could look more like the iPad Pro with slimmer bezels. But iPad Air users won\u2019t necessarily be getting Face ID, as the company has been working on integrating a Touch ID sensor in the power button. Let\u2019s see if Apple replaces the Lightning port with a USB-C port.<\/p>\n<p>What about the iPhone? Apple has been working hard on a new generation of smartphones, but the new iPhone might not be ready just yet. Apple has told shareholders that the release would occur a bit later than usual. Maybe the company will mention it, maybe not.<\/p>\n<p>You can watch the live stream directly on this page, as Apple is streaming its conference on YouTube.<\/p>\n<p>If you have an Apple TV, you can download the Apple Events app in the App Store. It lets you stream today\u2019s event and rewatch old ones. The app icon was updated a few days ago for the event.<\/p>\n<p>And if you don\u2019t have an Apple TV and don\u2019t want to use YouTube, the company also lets you live stream the event from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/apple-events\/livestream\/\">Apple Events section<\/a> on its website.

href=\"https:\/\/www.lanzatech.com\/\">LanzaTech&#8217;s technology<\/a> to capture carbon dioxide emissions and turn those emissions into fuel and chemicals, the company is rolling out a new small-scale waste biomass gasifier in India.<\/p>\n<p>The new gasifier, which was announced Tuesday on TechCrunch Disrupt&#8217;s virtual stage, will be hosted at Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemical, one of India&#8217;s largest refiners. The <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/lanzatech-new-zealand\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"lanzatech-new-zealand\">LanzaTech <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> gasifier, which will be built in partnership with Indian project development firm Ankur Scientific, will use waste to make ethanol and chemicals rather than power.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While most of the industry uses large-scale, expensive oxygen-blown gasifiers to make liquids, the LanzaTech air-blown technology is much cheaper and easier to operate and can still produce bacteria at a scale that produces a meaningful amount of ethanol.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contamination also isn&#8217;t an issue with the gas feedstock for LanzaTech&#8217;s bacteria, according to LanzaTech CEO <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/jennifer-holmgren\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"jennifer-holmgren\">Jennifer Holmgren <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>. The new process can produce biochar that ends up replacing fertilizer in soil and thereby reducing nitrogen oxide emissions, which are another greenhouse gas contributing to global climate change.<\/p>\n<p>If the pilot project is successful and the gasifiers are rolled out at scale across India, it could mean an ability for the country to produce roughly 25 billion liters of ethanol per year and result in removing 60 million tons of carbon dioxide annually, according to LanzaTech&#8217;s estimates.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;Overall something that people said makes no sense, may well make sense and may well result in benefits beyond just the immediate reuse of waste agri carbon and production of a fuel that results in keeping some petroleum in the ground,&#8221; according to a statement from Holmgren. &#8220;Holistic systems thinking is the way.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Holmgren, the small pilot project in India is an example of how small-scale, low-cost distributed systems can compete with the big oil industry.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There are two paths to scale, bigger which is cheaper per unit produced, or massively replicating a small scale unit (numbering up versus scaling up),&#8221; Holmgren said. &#8220;Most people have always believed that numbering up is for toys and food, but I think it will also fit process technology. Certainly, larger fits petroleum, but it can&#8217;t fit biotechnology or biomass or waste gases which are distributed and difficult to move.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Decarbonization, Holmgren believes, will require a reimagining of traditional systems if humanity is to break the carbon cycle that&#8217;s now causing global climate catastrophes that can be observed in the Western United States right now.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We must not benchmark today\u2019s innovation against the past; we must, instead, imagine and create a very different future, one where the production of energy, fuels and chemicals is based on distributed, rather than centralized principles,&#8221; said Holmgren. &#8220;Recent breakthroughs in miniaturization, automation, AI and 3D printing enable distributed production beyond anything that could have been previously imagined and of course, a simple gasifier will help that along.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f60ef29d7e1933299669ca7\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As part of the continuing global rollout of LanzaTech&#8217;s technology to capture carbon dioxide emissions and turn those emissions into fuel and chemicals, the company is rolling out a new small-scale waste biomass gasifier in India.

Built in collaboration with Lenovo, the Series One uses high-end cameras and microphones and then marries them with Google&#8217;s AI smarts thanks to using Google&#8217;s own <a href=\"https:\/\/coral.ai\/products\/#production-products\">Coral M.2 accelerator<\/a> modules with the company&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/edge-tpu\">Edge TPUs<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Previous Google Meet <a href=\"https:\/\/meetingdevices.withgoogle.com\/\">hardware efforts<\/a> from companies like <a href=\"https:\/\/meetingdevices.withgoogle.com\/products\/5769\/asus\">ASUS<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/meetingdevices.withgoogle.com\/products\/5504\/acer-chromebase-for-google-meet\">Acer<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/meetingdevices.withgoogle.com\/products\/4937\/logitech-tap-google-meet-large-room-bundle\">Logitech<\/a> were generally built around a Chromebox. This new effort uses a custom-built compute system at its core and combines that with an almost Google Nest-like tablet-sized screen, a soundbar with eight built-in microphones, additional microphone pods and one of two cameras.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2045507\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Google_Series-One_SmartCameraXL_Front-3-4-View.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2045507\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2045507\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Google_Series-One_SmartCameraXL_Front-3-4-View.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Google_Series-One_SmartCameraXL_Front-3-4-View.png 8000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Google_Series-One_SmartCameraXL_Front-3-4-View.png?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Google_Series-One_SmartCameraXL_Front-3-4-View.png?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Google_Series-One_SmartCameraXL_Front-3-4-View.png?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Google_Series-One_SmartCameraXL_Front-3-4-View.png?resize=680,382 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Google_Series-One_SmartCameraXL_Front-3-4-View.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Google_Series-One_SmartCameraXL_Front-3-4-View.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Google_Series-One_SmartCameraXL_Front-3-4-View.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2045507\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Google<\/p><\/div><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The cameras are maybe the most interesting option here, with the Smart Camera XL featuring a 20.3-megapixel sensor and 4.3x optical zoom. Thanks to these specs, it can be used as a digital PTZ (pan, tilt, zoom) camera. With that, the system can always automatically zoom in to frame everybody in the room and when the next person joins, it can zoom and pan as necessary to make sure everybody is still visible.<\/p>\n<p>The regular Smart Camera can still do most of this, but it doesn&#8217;t feature the optical zoom, making it a better solution for smaller rooms. Google partnered with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.huddly.com\/\">Huddly<\/a> to develop this camera system (and the two companies also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.huddly.com\/solutions\/google\/\">collaborated<\/a> on previous Meet hardware projects).<\/p>\n<p>But Google also put a lot of effort into the audio system. With its eight beam-forming microphones built into the soundbar and advanced noise cancellation techniques running on Google&#8217;s AI chips, the system should be able to filter out most distractions. Companies can add additional soundbars that only feature the speakers and microphones without the AI chips to cover even larger rooms. These additional units only feature the speakers and microphones, without the additional AI hardware since all of the processing needs to be done centrally.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2045506\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Google_Series_One_Touch-Controller_Angled-Front.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2045506\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2045506\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Google_Series_One_Touch-Controller_Angled-Front.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Google_Series_One_Touch-Controller_Angled-Front.png 8000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Google_Series_One_Touch-Controller_Angled-Front.png?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Google_Series_One_Touch-Controller_Angled-Front.png?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Google_Series_One_Touch-Controller_Angled-Front.png?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Google_Series_One_Touch-Controller_Angled-Front.png?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Google_Series_One_Touch-Controller_Angled-Front.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Google_Series_One_Touch-Controller_Angled-Front.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Google_Series_One_Touch-Controller_Angled-Front.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2045506\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Google<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>One nice touch here is that the team also made it easy to install these systems thanks to using Power-over-Ethernet.

Among the changes, Waze is gaining personalized recommendations based on a user&#8217;s trip history, as well as traffic notifications, ETA improvements, lane suggestions, expanded Google Assistant integration and more.<\/p>\n<p>Waze&#8217;s trip suggestions are one of the more notable new features, as they tap into the Waze user&#8217;s historical driving patterns to make inferences about where the user may be headed next. The feature, which will roll out next month, will be based on trips the user took in the past as well as the locations they&#8217;ve recently driven to, Waze says. The suggestions will offer the driver a visual overview of their trip, including details like the time the trip will take and the expected traffic.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2046539\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2046539\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2046539\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Trip-Suggestions.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Trip-Suggestions.png 1920w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Trip-Suggestions.png?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Trip-Suggestions.png?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Trip-Suggestions.png?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Trip-Suggestions.png?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Trip-Suggestions.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Trip-Suggestions.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2046539\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Waze<\/p><\/div><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Another new feature, traffic notifications, will alert users when traffic begins to build up or the driver risks being late on both favorite and frequent destinations, as well as one-time planned drives.

As the name suggests, Waze will now be able to tell drivers what lane to be in when they&#8217;re merging or exiting a stretch of highway.

Contrary to the misguided popular belief, it&#8217;s not a pipeline problem as much as it&#8217;s a retention problem.<\/p>\n<p>Black Tech Pipeline aims to debunk that myth and help support Black technologists along their respective journeys. Black Tech Pipeline, founded by Pariss Athena, has three key offerings: a job board where anyone can pay to be featured, a recruitment and consulting service and connections to potential speakers for events.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The goal of Black Tech Pipeline is to bring exposure to the existing community of Black technologists,&#8221; Athena said. &#8220;We are focused on those who are here because we want to shine a light on the whole &#8216;pipeline problem&#8217; not being real. We&#8217;ve been in the industry. We exist in it. We&#8217;ve been here for years. We&#8217;re seniors, we&#8217;re mid-level, we&#8217;re a range. But we also want to create this ripple effect for those who are outside of the industry to show them you have a community of people who look like you and are here to support you through your journey.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Currently, there are nearly 700 Black technologists in the database. As of July, 8.66% of candidates had zero years of experience, 37.33% had one to two years&#8217; worth of experience, 27.33% had two to three years of experience, 22% had five to 10 years of experience and 10.5% had 10-plus years of experience.<\/p>\n<p>Companies featured on the job board are paying customers of Black Tech Pipeline. That means they get a customized landing page where they can describe the roles they have available, as well as detail their values, how the company thinks about diversity and inclusion, and more. These companies will also be featured in Black Tech Pipeline&#8217;s newsletter and social media platforms, which has a combined following of more than 40,000 people.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We want to give a very transparent view of what it means to work there as someone who is most likely going to be the minority in the workplace,&#8221; Athena said.<\/p>\n<p>Athena landed on the idea to create a database of Black technologists after she was laid off from her first job as a software engineer and became more active on Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When I got on, I noticed there was a really tiny community of Black technologists, which was interesting, because, at least out here in Boston &#8212; and I&#8217;m sure this is everywhere &#8212; but not only have I always been the only software engineer on the development team, but literally the only Black person in the entire company ever since I entered this industry,&#8221; Athena said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;So because I rarely saw people who look like me, I just figured we weren&#8217;t really in this industry, so when I saw that we were a few of us, I was like, &#8216;Oh, cool, I wonder how many more of us are out there?&#8217; And I had put out a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ParissAthena\/status\/1068873547005812737\">tweet asking what does Black Twitter in tech look like<\/a>? And that tweet, unexpectedly, went semi-viral and lots of Black technologists from all over the world posted themselves into the tweet, and it created this super long thread of their pictures and captioning what they do in the industry. And overnight, it really formed this movement and community of Black tech Twitter.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That same week, employers began reaching out to Athena, asking her to help them recruit Black people, she said. Despite not having any recruiting experience, Athena agreed to help. She developed a talent database in order to connect candidates with employers, as well as an accompanying application that automatically filters into the database.<\/p>\n<p>In its earlier days, Athena said she noticed that while many of the candidates were being hired, a lot of them weren\u2019t being retained.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;So there was just this retention problem,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And as someone who has always been the only Black person in predominantly white spaces, I knew what was going on.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2045225\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2045225\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2045225\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/IVRDw28.jpg?w=510\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/IVRDw28.jpg 900w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/IVRDw28.jpg?resize=113,150 113w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/IVRDw28.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/IVRDw28.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/IVRDw28.jpg?resize=510,680 510w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/IVRDw28.jpg?resize=38,50 38w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2045225\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pariss Athena, founder of Black Tech Pipeline. Photo courtesy of Athena.<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s what led Athena to create a consultant package and start charging companies. Anytime a candidate would get hired through her efforts, she would conduct biweekly check-ins during the first 90 days to see how they&#8217;re doing.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;That was my way of ensuring that I didn&#8217;t send them somewhere harmful,&#8221; Athena said. &#8220;And with their consent and safety in mind, I would relay the feedback that they gave me to the employer.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The goal with that is to help employers improve their work culture, as well as the systems and processes that have bias baked into them. Initially, Athena was doing this for free and operating simply out of her Twitter direct messages. Athena has since started charging companies for these services as part of her company, Black Tech Pipeline.<\/p>\n<p>Despite all the effort Athena has put into Black Tech Pipeline, this is not yet her full-time job, but she wants it to be. Ideally, she would be focused more on the consultation piece.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I really love the fact that I get to be this almost external HR, but for the candidate and not for the company,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So, I&#8217;m not here to protect the company and make sure it looks good no matter how much harm they&#8217;re doing. I&#8217;m here to make sure this person is having a good experience, and if not, I&#8217;m going to hold you accountable and we&#8217;re going to work on it. So that&#8217;s really what I want to do &#8212; make change and hold people to their word. I don&#8217;t want to work with anyone that&#8217;s going to be performative.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Of the 12 companies she&#8217;s worked with so far, there have been nine hires. Technically, there have been more, but Athena said she doesn&#8217;t count the ones where people have been hired but haven&#8217;t stayed for very long. Part of that retention problem, she said, reflects a couple of issues she&#8217;s had with larger companies.<\/p>\n<p>One of those issues is there being a disconnect between the folks at the company who really do want to implement change and the higher-ups who feel less inclined to do so, Athena said. Another one is that some folks who have been hired have experienced microaggressions that made them want to leave.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And so when those things happen, I&#8217;m reporting it to the manager but they don&#8217;t know how to move forward with it,&#8221; Athena said. &#8220;They&#8217;ll say it&#8217;s not substantial enough or say it was coincidental. When I cannot get through to employers like that, I finish out my contract with them by doing the check-ins and reporting feedback, but I don&#8217;t dive in to look at their current processes and see where they can improve. I don&#8217;t do that anymore for those types of employers. So I just finish out the contract and move on.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The tech industry has become known as a place that is predominantly white and male.

The idea behind Automated Workflows, as it is called, is to remove some of the manual busywork of updating multiple boards across teams when a new patch is ready to go to testing, for example (or when it fails those tests and the development team has to fix it).<\/p>\n<p>As <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/zenhub\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"zenhub\">ZenHub <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> founder and CEO Aaron Upright told me, Automated Workflows are only the first step in the company&#8217;s journey from not just being the most integrated service on <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/github\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"github\">GitHub <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> but also the most automated.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2046235\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/automatedworkflow_press-2.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2046235\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2046235\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/automatedworkflow_press-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"648\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/automatedworkflow_press-2.jpg 1512w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/automatedworkflow_press-2.jpg?resize=150,95 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/automatedworkflow_press-2.jpg?resize=300,190 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/automatedworkflow_press-2.jpg?resize=768,486 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/automatedworkflow_press-2.jpg?resize=680,430 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/automatedworkflow_press-2.jpg?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2046235\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> ZenHub<\/p><\/div><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Teams still struggle with the mechanics of agile project management, he noted. &#8220;Things like what frameworks to choose. How to organize their projects. You talk to small companies and teams, you talk to large companies &#8212; it&#8217;s a problem for everyone, where people don&#8217;t know if they should be Scrum, or Kanban or how to organize Sprint planning meetings.&#8221; What ZenHub wants to do is remove as many of these friction points as possible and automate them for teams.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s starting with the hand-off between teams because that&#8217;s one of the pain points its customers are struggling with all the time. And since teams tend to have their own projects and workspaces, the ZenHub team had to build a solution that worked across a company&#8217;s various boards.<\/p>\n<p>The result is a new tool that is pretty much a drag-and-drop service that automatically creates notifications and moves items between workplaces as they move from QA to production, for example.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a way to automate work between different workspaces,&#8221; explained Upright. &#8220;And we&#8217;re really excited about this being kind of the first step in our automation journey.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Over time, Upright expects, the team will be able to use machine learning to understand more about the connections that its users are making between teams. Using that data, its systems may be able to also recommend workflows as well.<\/p>\n<p>The next part of ZenHub&#8217;s focus on automation will be a tool for managing the Sprint planning process.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Already today, ZenHub is capturing things like velocity. We&#8217;re measuring that on a team by team basis. We understand the priority of issues in our workflow. What we want to be able to do is allow teams to automatically set a Sprint schedule, say, for example, every two weeks. Then, based on the velocity that we know about your team, maybe your team can accomplish 50 story points every two weeks &#8212; we want to auto-build that Sprint for you.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>ZenHub, the popular project management solution for GitHub users, today announced the launch of its new features for automating hand-offs between teams.

The difference in those two figures comes from the $305 million of capital held by the SPAC and $275 million in a private investment into the company that will be conducted as part of the acquisition, along with fees and some other ancillary financials.<\/p>\n<p>What does that look like from a returns perspective? Desktop Metal raised six rounds of capital (Series A through Series E &amp; E-1), raising a total of $438 million, according to the company\u2019s filings. Using the numbers from these filings, we can do some back-of-the-envelope math to make some rough guesses at how the individual funds returned on their investment.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2046496\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/desktop-metal-investors.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"368\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/desktop-metal-investors.jpg 2800w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/desktop-metal-investors.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/desktop-metal-investors.jpg?resize=300,162 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/desktop-metal-investors.jpg?resize=768,416 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/desktop-metal-investors.jpg?resize=680,368 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/desktop-metal-investors.jpg?resize=1536,832 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/desktop-metal-investors.jpg?resize=2048,1109 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/desktop-metal-investors.jpg?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The biggest overall winner in terms of multiples on investment is <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/kleiner-perkins-caufield-byers\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"kleiner-perkins-caufield-byers\">Kleiner Perkins, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> which sits at a roughly 10x return on its full investment into the company. Kleiner took a fifth of the Series A, putting in roughly $3 million. It then proceeded to double down in the Series B, where it invested approximately $13 million, before tapering off its pro rata in later rounds. Given that its $20.4 million in invested capital is skewed toward the earliest rounds, that drove up its return multiple.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/nea\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"nea\">NEA, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> perhaps owing to its larger fund scale, constantly invested in the company across all of its rounds, ultimately investing about $57 million. It invested in Desktop Metal through its seed program, and also did about 43% of the Series A. It continued to invest heavily across all the company\u2019s growth rounds as well. Ultimately, NEA had a computed multiple on investment of roughly 5.67x.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, among early-stage investors, Lux managed to secure a 5.31x return, and it similarly plowed money into the company across all of its rounds, albeit slightly less aggressively than NEA, ultimately investing about $40 million into Desktop Metal.<\/p>\n<p>Heading over to the growth investors, GV started investing in the Series C round and invested a total of about $65 million across the later stage, securing a return of 2.5x. Northern Trust came in on the Series D and netted 1.6x, and KDT of Koch Industries ended up with about 1.44x through its mezzanine capital infusion.<\/p>\n<p>This includes all investors with more than 5% ownership in the company, per SEC regulations. Approximately $100 million of the company\u2019s $438 million in fundraising is not disclosed on its cap table, so there might be other VCs with swell returns that weren\u2019t obligated to disclose their shares. In addition, I am not including some minor common share stakes held by these venture firms, which are small enough to not radically change their return profile.<\/p>\n<p>Desktop Metal\u2019s quick appreciation in value over just five years will also give these firms very strong IRRs for their investments.<\/p>\n<p>Given that Desktop Metal is heading to the public markets through a SPAC, all of these investors have an option to sell their stakes or hold on to them going forward. If they hold and Desktop Metal performs well, their stakes could increase dramatically in value, driving much higher returns. The reverse is naturally also true. Once public, the firms have flexibility on if and when to exit, and that decision will ultimately determine their final realized returns to LPs.<\/p>\n<p>For now though, this is a great checkpoint to see just how successful some of these venture firms were on this deal. Maybe firms can print gold with those 3D printers after all.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Desktop Metal is one of the most interesting startups to come out of Boston in some time, with a technology designed to \u201cprint metal.\u201d That\u2019s a potentially huge expansion for the 3D printing market, where flexible polymers are the norm, a material that limits the kinds of products that these machines can produce.

company announced this morning. The name change, which will take place next year, aims to better reflect the expanded content lineup that has joined the service following <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/08\/13\/viacomcbs\/\">the Viacom-CBS merger in 2019<\/a>, including content from brands like BET, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, Smithsonian Channel, TV Land, VH1, Paramount Pictures and other sports programming. In addition, Paramount+ will expand internationally in 2021, initially to markets like Australia, Latin America and the Nordics.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/viacomcbs\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"viacomcbs\">ViacomCBS&#8217; <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> plans to rebrand the service were previously known. The company <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/07\/a-rebranded-and-updated-version-of-cbs-all-access-will-launch-this-summer\/\">earlier this year had told<\/a> investors a rebranded and expanded service would arrive sometime in the summer. It later <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/30\/cbs-all-access-expands\/\">pushed that time frame back<\/a> to 2021, but continued to roll out new content.<\/p>\n<p>ViacomCBS CEO Bob Bakish had earlier described the company&#8217;s plans for the expanded service as one that would allow it to showcase the company&#8217;s biggest franchises and deep library, but also one that would leverage the company&#8217;s IP for original content, as it has already done now with its multiple &#8220;Star Trek&#8221; series and &#8220;The Good Wife&#8221; spin-off &#8220;The Good Fight,&#8221; for example. The rebranded service would also continue to promote the company&#8217;s sports offerings, including its continual airing of NFL games as well as those from other leagues, like the NCAA and PGA.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>All this would run on CBS All Access&#8217; existing tech platform, not a new service built from scratch.<\/p>\n<p>Today, ViacomCBS notes that the new service Paramount+ will also feature an expanded array of originals. This includes &#8220;The Offer,&#8221; a scripted limited series about the making of &#8220;The Godfather;&#8221; CIA spy drama &#8220;Lioness,&#8221; created by Taylor Sheridan; a reimagined version of MTV&#8217;s &#8220;Behind the Music,&#8221; which will focus on the past 40 years; a true crime docu-series, &#8220;The Real Criminal Minds,&#8221; based on the fictional TV hit; and a revival of BET&#8217;s &#8220;The Game.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>These shows will join previously announced plans for new kids original series &#8220;Kamp Koral,&#8221; from Nickelodeon&#8217;s &#8220;Spongebob Squarepants,&#8221; and the service&#8217;s plan to be the SVOD home for &#8220;The Spongebob Movie: Sponge on the Run.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Paramount+ will also continue to feature existing originals, like &#8220;The Good Fight,&#8221; &#8220;The Twilight Zone,&#8221; &#8220;Tooning Out the News,&#8221; &#8220;No Activity,&#8221; Why Women Kill,&#8221; &#8220;Interrogation,&#8221; &#8220;The Thomas John Experience,&#8221; &#8220;Tell Me a Story,&#8221; &#8220;Star Trek: Discovery,&#8221; &#8220;Star Trek: Picard,&#8221; &#8220;Star Trek: Lower Decks,&#8221; as well as the upcoming series &#8220;The Stand,&#8221; &#8220;The Man Who Fell to Earth,&#8221; &#8220;The Harper House,&#8221; &#8220;Guilty Party&#8221; and &#8220;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The company says the broader lineup from this summer has already impacted the service&#8217;s viewership and demographics. Following the addition of the new content, including over 3,500 episodes of TV from across ViacomCBS&#8217; brands, CBS All Access broke its records for total monthly streams in August and saw one of its best-ever months for new subscribers. These users were also measurably younger than the service&#8217;s overall average subscriber age, thanks in part to the addition of UEFA and other content.<\/p>\n<p>As CBS All Access nears its 2021 rebrand to Paramount+, it will further expand its content lineup to reach more than 30,000 episodes and movies and continue to develop new originals from brands including BET, CBS, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, Paramount Pictures and others.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Paramount is an iconic and storied brand beloved by consumers all over the world, and it is synonymous with quality, integrity and world-class storytelling,&#8221; said Bob Bakish, president and CEO, ViacomCBS, in a statement about the changes. &#8220;With Paramount+, we\u2019re excited to establish one global streaming brand in the broad-pay segment that will draw on the sheer breadth and depth of the ViacomCBS portfolio to offer an extraordinary collection of content for everyone to enjoy.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Paramount+, notably, is also the latest to embrace the plus sign (+) suffix as part of its branding, following the launch of newer streaming services like Disney+, Apple TV+, ESPN+, TiVo+ and, just yesterday, the kids-focused media catalog, Amazon Kids+. It&#8217;s unclear, however, if the name &#8220;Paramount&#8221; will resonate with prized younger viewers as much as the company hopes, or if this general trend toward adding a &#8220;plus&#8221; sign is helping these services truly carve out their own space.<\/p>\n<p>ViacomCBS didn&#8217;t announce any plans to change pricing when the new service goes live.<\/p>\n<p>In Q2 2020, ViacomCBS said its domestic paid streaming services, including CBS All Access and Showtime, had reached 16.2 million subscribers, up 74% year-over-year.

All of these phytonutrients that we know exist,&#8221; said Flatt. &#8220;This forager AI platform that we\u2019ve built\u2026 we\u2019ve developed a proprietary library that\u2019s about 5 times what the world knows [and] one of the powers of Forager is as we do find known or new compounds we\u2019re able to predict their utility with respect to health.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The company already <a href=\"https:\/\/www.danonenorthamerica.com\/news\/danone-north-america-partners-with-brightseed-to-discover-new-health-benefits-in-plants-using-artificial-intelligence-technology\">has one major partnership in place<\/a> with Danone North America, which it announced earlier this year.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs a leader in plant-based food and beverages, Danone North America values external partnerships that can help us improve and optimize the taste, texture and nutritional aspects of our products, and contribute to our biodiversity vision,\u201d<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> said Takoua Debeche, SVP Research &amp; Innovation at Danone North America, in a statement at the time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Forager&#8217;s nutrient identification technology also has implications far beyond ingredient science, said Flatt.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;What forager can do is really help create what we\u2019ll call a virtuous cycle to incentivize adoption of a more biodiverse food supply chain and to move towards more regenerative agricultural practices and we do this by revealing the hidden qualities or benefits of some of these lesser known crops and highlighting why they can be of greater value and tell a story,&#8221; he said.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>For instance, Brightseed is already partnering with a company to evaluate an underutilized superfruit and work on improving and boosting its cultivation.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;There\u2019s some albeit limited data that shows that agricultural practices can influence these phytonutrient contents. What Forager does is help valorize those phyotnutrients and creates a story that helps drive consumer adoption and demand for more restorative products that are produced with more regenerative agricultural practices that lead to more nutrients in crops,&#8221; Flatt said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although the company&#8217;s revenues are currently hovering under $10 million, Flatt and his investors expect that to change rapidly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cBrightseed\u2019s application of technology is transforming how we understand the resources available for our health and well-being in nature,\u201d said Dr. David Russell, operating partner at Lewis &amp; Clark AgriFood, in a statement. \u201cThese discoveries already have a major impact on ingredient selection and how we\u2019re formulating the things we consume every day.

bubble a few years back. The Somerville, Massachusetts-based company set itself apart by bringing advanced industrial 3D-printing technologies to the consumer space. In recent years, the tech has also positioned the startup ahead of the competition when it comes to expanding into different manufacturing aspects.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Medical and dental have been two key targets. Products like prosthetics and retainers are two prime exemplars of products that can benefit from both customization and speedy manufacturing. Today, the company announced the Form 3BL, a medical and dental-focused take on the recently announced Form 3L, its $10,000 large-format stereolithography printer.<\/p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2046059\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/08042020_3BL-BP-dental_182-copyS.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/08042020_3BL-BP-dental_182-copyS.jpg 8495w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/08042020_3BL-BP-dental_182-copyS.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/08042020_3BL-BP-dental_182-copyS.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/08042020_3BL-BP-dental_182-copyS.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/08042020_3BL-BP-dental_182-copyS.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/08042020_3BL-BP-dental_182-copyS.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/08042020_3BL-BP-dental_182-copyS.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/08042020_3BL-BP-dental_182-copyS.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Form 3BL shares most of the 3L\u2019s specs, including a build volume that\u2019s roughly five times larger than the standard Form 3 printer. The biggest differentiator is optimization for biocompatible materials. The system is designed to be used in-office for healthcare providers and dental providers to produce models and dental needs quickly in-house.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Also new today is the Wash L + Cure L, for treating large-scale objects after initial printing.

And those indexing capabilities is where Varada&#8217;s smarts can be found. As Vanounou explained, the company is using a machine learning system to understand when users tend to run certain workloads, and then caches the data ahead of time, making the system far faster than its competitors.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If you think about big organizations and think about the workloads and the queries, what happens during the morning time is different from evening time. What happened yesterday is not what happened today. What happened on a rainy day is not what happened on a shiny day. [&#8230;] We listen to what&#8217;s going on and we optimize. We leverage the indexing technology. We index what is needed when it is needed.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That helps speed up queries, but it also means less data has to be replicated, which also brings down the cost. As MizMaa&#8217;s Aaron Applbaum noted, since Varada is not a SaaS solution, the buyers still get all of the discounts from their cloud providers, too.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the system can allocate resources intelligently so that different users can tap into different amounts of bandwidth. You can tell it to give customers more bandwidth than your financial analysts, for example.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin: 0em 2em; text-indent: -1em; float: right; align: right; width: 50%; display: inline-block; color: white; background: #36c275; padding: 1em 3em; font-size: .7em; background-image: url('https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/tc-gradient-bg.png'); background-size: 100% 100%;\">\n<h3>READ MORE<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a style=\"color: white;\" href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/snowflake-and-jfrog-raise-ipo-ranges-as-tech-markets-stay-hot\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Snowflake and JFrog raise IPO ranges as tech markets stay hot<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a style=\"color: white;\" href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/24\/databricks-acquires-redash-a-visualizations-service-for-data-scientists\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Databricks acquires Redash, a visualizations service for data scientists<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a style=\"color: white;\" href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/05\/datafold-is-solving-the-chaos-of-data-engineering\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Datafold is solving the chaos of data engineering<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<p>&#8220;Data is growing like crazy: in volume, in scale, in complexity, in who requires it and what the business intelligence uses are, what the API uses are,&#8221; Applbaum said when I asked him why he decided to invest. &#8220;And compute is getting slightly cheaper, but not really, and storage is getting cheaper. So if you can make the trade-off to store more stuff, and access things more intelligently, more quickly, more agile &#8212; that was the basis of our thesis, as long as you can do it without compromising performance.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Varada, with its team of experienced executives, architects and engineers, ticked a lot of the company&#8217;s boxes in this regard, but he also noted that unlike some other Israeli startups, the team understood that it had to listen to customers and understand their needs, too.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In Israel, you have a history &#8212; and it&#8217;s become less and less the case &#8212; but historically, there&#8217;s a joke that it&#8217;s &#8216;ready, fire, aim.&#8217; You build a technology, you&#8217;ve got this beautiful thing and you&#8217;re like, &#8216;alright, we did it,&#8217; but without listening to the needs of the customer,&#8221; he explained.<\/p>\n<p>The Varada team is not afraid to compare itself to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.snowflake.com\/\">Snowflake<\/a>, which at least at first glance seems to make similar promises. Vananou praised the company for opening up the data warehousing market and proving that people are willing to pay for good analytics. But he argues that Varada&#8217;s approach is fundamentally different.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We embrace the data lake. So if you are Mr. Customer, your data is your data. We&#8217;re not going to take it, move it, copy it. This is your single source of truth,&#8221; he said. And in addition, the data can stay in the company&#8217;s virtual private cloud. He also argues that Varada isn&#8217;t so much focused on the business users but the technologists inside a company.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Varada, a Tel
