href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tiktok\">TikTok <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> will not

legality and whether the app poses a risk to national security as the Trump administration claims.<\/p>\n<p>For weeks since President Donald Trump signed two executive orders in early August, the government has threatened to shut down the viral video sharing app over fears that its parent company <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/bytedance\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"bytedance\">ByteDance, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> headquartered in Beijing, could be forced to turn over user data to the Chinese government. TikTok, which has <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/tiktok-hits-100m-users-in-europe-as-the-clock-ticks-on-its-us-business\/\">100 million users<\/a>\u00a0in the United States alone, has long rejected the claims.<\/p>\n<p>TikTok first filed a lawsuit against the administration on September 18, and on Thursday this week filed a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/23\/tiktok-files-for-injunction-against-pending-trump-app-ban\/\">last minute injunction<\/a>\u00a0in an effort to stop the ban going into effect Sunday night. On Friday, the government asked the court to reject the injunction in a sealed motion, which the government later refiled as a public motion with some redactions. A public hearing on the injunction was set for Sunday morning. The case is being heard in DC District Court presided by judge\u00a0Carl J. Nichols.<\/p>\n<p>In its ruling on Sunday, the court gave just its decision, with the formal opinion handed over privately to just the two opposing parties. Due to sensitive material included in the government&#8217;s motion, the parties have until Monday to ask for any redactions before the final opinion will be published.<\/p>\n<p>The decision is just the latest episode in the continuing saga of the sprawling fight over the future of the fastest-growing social app in America. A <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/13\/oracle-wins-bid-to-buy-tiktok\/\">deal reached<\/a> between ByteDance and the U.S. government last weekend was believed to have resolved the standoff between the two parties, but the deal has frayed over disputed details\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/21\/tiktok-wtf\/\">between buyer Oracle<\/a> and ByteDance.<\/p>\n<p>The administration first launched an action against TikTok on August 6, with President Trump arguing in an executive order that the app posed an unreasonable national security risk for American citizens. That order mirrored a similar one published the same day that put restrictions on the popular Mandarin-language messenger app WeChat, which is owned by China-based Tencent.<\/p>\n<p>Last weekend, a federal magistrate judge in San Francisco put in place an injunction on <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/18\/tiktok-and-wechat-will-be-banned-in-the-u-s-from-sunday\/\">the Commerce Department\u2019s ban on WeChat<\/a>, pending further court deliberations. TikTok, whose arguments mirror those in the WeChat lawsuit, was hoping for a similar outcome in its own legal proceedings.<\/p>\n<p>One difference between the two lawsuits is the plaintiffs. In WeChat\u2019s case, a group of WeChat users filed a lawsuit arguing that a ban would hurt their expression of speech. TikTok is representing itself in its own fight with the government.<\/p>\n<p>The court case is TikTok Inc. et al v. Trump et al (1:2020-cv-02658).<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"5u633YLlKV\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/19\/tiktok-deal-terms\/\">The TikTok deal solves quite literally nothing<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;The TikTok deal solves quite literally nothing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/19\/tiktok-deal-terms\/embed\/#?secret=5u633YLlKV\" data-secret=\"5u633YLlKV\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A U.S. federal court has said a ban on TikTok will not go into effect\u00a0on Monday as scheduled.

Watch Series 6 review"},"content":{"rendered":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">When it comes<\/span> to smartwatches, it\u2019s Apple against the world. It\u2019s not that there aren\u2019t plenty of other products to choose from \u2014 it\u2019s more that the company has just utterly dominated the space to such a point that any other device is relegated to the realm of \u201c<a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Watch alternatives.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The company has been successful in the space for the usual Apple reasons: premium hardware with deeply integrated software, third-party support, a large cross-device ecosystem play and, of, course, simplicity. Taken as a whole, the Watch just works, right out of the box.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Five years after launch, the line is fairly mature. As such, it\u2019s no surprise, really, that recent updates have largely amounted to refinements. As with most updates, the watch has gotten a processor boost up to the A14 processor, which the company claims is 20% faster than the last version.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>Perhaps the biggest hardware upgrade, however, is the addition of a blood oxygen sensor, an important piece in the company\u2019s quest to offer as complete an image of wearer health as is possible from the wrist.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Dkvjc9vzsO\"><p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/a-closer-look-at-the-new-apple-watches\/\">A closer look at the new Apple Watches<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;A closer look at the new Apple Watches&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/a-closer-look-at-the-new-apple-watches\/embed\/#?secret=Dkvjc9vzsO\" data-secret=\"Dkvjc9vzsO\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">I wrote<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/a-closer-look-at-the-new-apple-watches\/\"> a pretty lengthy piece<\/a> about the watch last week after wearing it for a few days. As I mentioned at the time, it was an odd kind of writeup, somewhere between hands-on and review. A week or so later, however, I\u2019m more comfortable calling this a review \u2014 even if not too many of my initial impressions have changed much in the past several days. After all, a mature product largely means most of the foundations remain unchanged.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Series 6 certainly looks the part. The Watch is tough to distinguish from other recent models \u2014 and for that matter, the new and significantly cheaper SE. The biggest visual change is the addition of new colors. In addition to the standard Gray and Gold, Apple\u2019s added new Blue and (Product)Red cases. The latter seems to be the more ostentatious of the pair. The company sent me a blue model, and honestly, it\u2019s a lot more subtle than I expected. It\u2019s more of a deep blue hue, really, that reads more as black a lot of the time.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s tough to imagine the product undergoing any sort of radical rethink of the device\u2019s design language at this point. We may see slight tweaks, including larger screen area going forward, but on the whole, Apple is very much committed to a form factor that has worked very well for it. I will probably always prefer Samsung\u2019s spinning bezel as a quick way to interface with the operating system, but the crown does the job well and scrolling through menus even feels a bit zippier this time, perhaps owing to that faster silicon.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"LWNvL7GOH3\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/you-can-now-return-apples-solo-loop-for-a-new-size-without-sending-back-the-watch\/\">You can now return Apple\u2019s Solo Loop for a new size, without sending back the Watch<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;You can now return Apple\u2019s Solo Loop for a new size, without sending back the Watch&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/you-can-now-return-apples-solo-loop-for-a-new-size-without-sending-back-the-watch\/embed\/#?secret=LWNvL7GOH3\" data-secret=\"LWNvL7GOH3\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">The new Solo Loop bands hit a bit of a hiccup out of the gate. I\u2019ve <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/you-can-now-return-apples-solo-loop-for-a-new-size-without-sending-back-the-watch\/\">detailed that a bit more here<\/a>, but I suspect that much of the problem came down to the difficulty of selling a specifically sized product during a strange period in history where in-person try-ons aren\u2019t really an option. In other words, just really bad timing on that front.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Personally, I quite like the braided model. I\u2019ve been using it as my day to day band. It\u2019s nice and blends in a lot better than the silicone model (I\u2019ve frankly never been much of a fan of Apple\u2019s silicone bands). But I do need to mention that Apple sent me a couple different sizes, which made it much easier to find the right fit. I recognize that. Especially when the braided Solo Loop costs a fairly exorbitant $99. The silicone version is significantly cheaper at $49, but either way, you\u2019re not getting off cheap there. So you definitely want to make sure you get the right fit.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052164\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052164\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2052164\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg 4000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052164\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This is doubly important given the fact that the Series 6\u2019s biggest new feature \u2014 blood oxygen monitoring \u2014 is highly dependent on you getting a good fit. The sensor utilizes a series of LEDs on the bottom of the watch to shine infrared and red light through the wearer\u2019s skin and into their blood vessels. The color of light that reflects back gives the watch a picture of the oxygen levels in the blood. The whole thing takes about 15 seconds, but only works if your fit is right. Even with the right Solo Loop on, I found myself having to retake it a few times when I first started wearing the watch.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Beyond the on-demand measurements, the watch will also take readings throughout the day and night, mapping these trends over time and incorporating them into sleep readings. The overall readings will give you a good picture of your numbers over time. Honestly though, I get the sense that this is really just the tip of the iceberg of future functionality.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For now, there\u2019s really no specific guidance \u2014 or context \u2014 given as far as what the numbers mean. Mine are generally between 90-100%. The Mayo Clinic tells me that\u2019s good, but obviously there are a lot of different factors and variations that can\u2019t properly be contextualized in a single paragraph &#8212; or on a watch. And Apple certainly doesn\u2019t want to be accused of attempting to diagnose a condition or offer specific medical guidance. That\u2019s going to be an increasingly difficult line for the company to walk as it gets more serious about these sorts of health tools.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If I had to venture a guess, I would say that the combination of sleep tracking in watchOS 7 and the on-board oximeter opens the door pretty nicely for something like sleep apnea tracking (again, more focused on alerts of irregularity versus diagnosis). We\u2019ve seen a small handful of companies like Withings tackle this, so it seems like a no-brainer for Apple, pending all of the regulatory requirements, et al. There are all sorts of other conditions that blood oxygen levels could potentially alert the wearer to, if not actually diagnose.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sleep was probably the biggest addition with the latest version of watchOS. This was probably the biggest blind spot for the line, compared to the competition. At the moment, the sleep tracking is, admittedly, still pretty basic. Like much of the rest of the on-board tracking, it\u2019s mostly compared with changes over time. The metrics include time in bed versus time asleep, as well as incorporating heart rate figures from the sensor\u2019s regular check-ins. More specific breakdowns, including deep versus light versus REM sleep haven\u2019t arrived yet, but will no doubt be coming sooner than later.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052166\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052166\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2052166 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg 4000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052166\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The door is also wide open for Apple to really get mindfulness right. The company has incorporated a mindfulness reminder for a while now, but it\u2019s easy to imagine how the addition of various sensors like heart rate could really improve the picture and find the company going all-in on meditation, et al. The company could partner with a big meditation name \u2014 or, more likely, disrupt things with its own offering. The forthcoming Fitness+ offering could play an important role in the growth of that category, as well.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The other issue that sleep brings to the front is battery life. I was banking on the company making big strides in the battery department \u2014 after all, a big part of sleep tracking is ensuring that you\u2019ve got enough charge to get through the night. Apple really only briefly touched on battery \u2014 though <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ifixit.com\/Teardown\/Apple+Watch+Series+6+Teardown\/136694?utm_content=buffer408ad&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\">a recent teardown<\/a> has revealed some smallish improvements on battery capacity (perhaps owing, in part, to space freed up by the dropping of Force Touch).<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The company has also made some improvements to energy efficiency, courtesy of the new silicon. Official literature puts it at a \u201cfull-day\u201d of<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>battery life, up to 18 hours. I found I was able to get through a full day with juice to spare. That\u2019s good, but the company\u2019s still got some ground to make up on that front, compared to, say, the Fitbit Sense, which is capable of getting nearly a week on a charge. I think at this point, it\u2019s fair to hold wearables to higher standards of battery life than, say, handsets. More than once, I\u2019ve found myself intermittently charging the device \u2014 20 minutes here and 20 minutes there \u2014 in order to have enough juice left by bedtime.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"GxSVdjFou2\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/29\/apple-began-work-on-the-watchs-hand-washing-feature-years-before-covid-19\/\">Apple began work on the Watch\u2019s handwashing feature years before COVID-19<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Apple began work on the Watch\u2019s handwashing feature years before COVID-19&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/29\/apple-began-work-on-the-watchs-hand-washing-feature-years-before-covid-19\/embed\/#?secret=GxSVdjFou2\" data-secret=\"GxSVdjFou2\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you can spare more time than that, you should be able to get up to 80% in an hour or 100% in an hour and a half, courtesy of faster wireless charging. All told, the company has been able to shave significant time off of charging \u2014 a definite plus now that you\u2019re not just leaving it overnight to charge. The latest version of watchOS will also handily let you know before if you don\u2019t have enough charge to make it through a full night.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Other updates include the addition of the always-on Altimeter, which, along with the brighter screen doesn\u2019t appear to have had a major impact on the battery. I\u2019ll be honest, being stuck in the city for these last several months hasn\u2019t given me much reason to need real-time elevation stats. Though the feature is a nice step toward taking the Watch a bit more seriously as an outdoor accessory in a realm that has largely been dominated by the likes of Garmin.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052167\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052167\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2052167\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg 4000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052167\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Of course, the company now has three watches on the market \u2014 including the Series 3, which just keeps on ticking, and the lower-cost SE. The latter retains the design of the Series 6, but drops a number of the key sensors, which honestly should be perfectly sufficient for many users \u2014 and $170 cheaper than the 6\u2019s $399 starting price ($499 with cellular).<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Taken as a whole, the Series 6 isn\u2019t a huge leap forward over the Series 5 \u2014 and not really worth the upgrade for those who already own that recent vintage. But there are nice improvements throughout, augmented by good upgrades to watchOS that make the best-selling smartwatch that much better, while clearly laying the groundwork for Apple Watches of the future.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/Apple-Hardware-Event-2020\/\"><img src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/apple-hardware-event-2020.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When it comes to smartwatches, it\u2019s Apple against the world.

company he runs with managing partner Mary Chan, and would be part of a consortium of investors, according to one unnamed source who requested anonymity because the deal had yet to be finalized. The deal could close as early as mid-October.<\/p>\n<p>TuSimple as well as Girsky declined to comment.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>It&#8217;s no secret that TuSimple has been seeking new capital.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/26\/tusimple-seeking-250-million-in-new-funding-to-scale-self-driving-trucks\/\">TechCrunch reported in June that TuSimple was in search of $250 million<\/a> in fresh capital from investors. The company hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to help it raise funds, according to multiple sources familiar with the effort. Since then, TuSimple, which already has backing from Sina, UPS and Tier 1 supplier Mando Corp., has announced a partnership with Navistar and most recently, the Traton Group.<\/p>\n<p>Girsky has most recently captured headlines because of Nikola, where he is now the executive chairman. Girsky took over as chairman in September after Nikola&#8217;s founder, Trevor Milton, stepped down following fallout from <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/nikola-disputes-fraud-claims-in-carefully-worded-rebuttal\/\">a scathing report<\/a> by short-seller firm Hindenburg Research that accused the company of fraud. VectoIQ Acquisition Corp., the SPAC that Girsky formed in 2018, announced a merger with Nikola in March, and Girsky oversaw its public listing this past June. He shepherded an introduction between Nikola and his former boss, GM CEO and chairwoman Mary Barra, according to one source familiar with the deal. By mid-September the automaker had announced a partnership valued at $2 billion with Nikola.<\/p>\n<p>Girsky may be Nikola&#8217;s new chairman and certainly has executive experience, but his focus in recent years has been as an advisor, investor and matchmaker. Girsky has long had an interest in mobility-related companies. His firm VectoIQ LLC specializes in advising companies and connecting large companies with startups working on autonomous vehicle technology, electrification, connected, cybersecurity and mobility-as-a-service.<\/p>\n<p>VectoIQ invested in lidar startup Luminar, which recently announced it was going public through a SPAC merger with Gores Metropoulos Inc., at a post-deal market valuation of $3.4 billion. Girsky also sat on the board of autonomous vehicle startup Drive.ai, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/06\/25\/self-driving-startup-drive-ai-is-closing-down\/\">which was acquired by Apple<\/a> as the company prepared to shut down.<\/p>\n<p>Girsky&#8217;s investment in TuSimple is separate from his interests in Nikola, which has yet to begin production of its Class 8 trucks, according to sources.<\/p>\n<p>TuSimple, which launched in 2015 and has operations in China, San Diego and Tucson, Arizona, is focused on the autonomous vehicle technology stack that will allow Class 8 trucks to operate without a human driver. TuSimple operates a fleet of 40 self-driving trucks in the U.S. that are used for testing and to carry freight between Arizona and Texas.<\/p>\n<p>TuSimple announced in July plans to develop and begin producing autonomous semi trucks by 2024 in partnership with Navistar. In September, Volkswagen AG&#8217;s heavy-truck business Traton Group said it took a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/23\/vws-traton-group-strikes-a-deal-with-tusimple-to-develop-autonomous-trucks\/\">minority stake in TuSimple<\/a> as part of an agreement between the two companies to develop self-driving trucks. Neither company disclosed the financial terms of the partnership or the percentage of the minority stake. Traton did make a direct capital investment into TuSimple, according to one unnamed source familiar with the deal. It&#8217;s unclear if it also included in-kind contributions.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Steve Girsky, the former GM vice chairman, consultant and investor whose special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merged with hydrogen electric startup Nikola this summer, is in talks to back self-driving trucks startup TuSimple, according to four people familiar with the deal.

is <a href=\"https:\/\/oag.dc.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/2020-08\/Instacart-Complaint.pdf\">facing a lawsuit<\/a> from Washington, D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine that alleges the company charged customers millions of dollars in &#8220;deceptive service fees&#8221; and failed to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars&#8217; worth of sales tax. The suit seeks restitution for customers who paid those service fees, as well as back taxes and interest on taxes owed to D.C.<\/p>\n<p>The suit specifically alleges Instacart misled customers regarding the 10% service fee to think it was a tip for the delivery person, from September 2016 to April 2018.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Instacart tricked District consumers into believing they were tipping grocery delivery workers when, in fact, the company was charging them extra fees and pocketing the money,&#8221; Racine said in a statement. &#8220;Instacart used these deceptive fees to cover its operating costs while simultaneously failing to pay D.C. sales taxes. We filed suit to force Instacart to honor its legal obligations, pay D.C. the taxes it owes, and return millions of dollars to District consumers the company deceived.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>In a statement to TechCrunch, Instacart said customer transparency is important and that it currently discloses to customers that tips are separate from service fees. A spokesperson said Instacart also &#8220;clearly&#8221; indicates that service fees go toward its operations.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Additionally, 100% of customer tips always go to Instacart shoppers who are providing an important essential service for customers,&#8221; the spokesperson said. &#8220;We believe the accusations made in this complaint are without merit. We\u2019re disappointed with today&#8217;s action by D.C. Attorney General Racine\u2019s office and we welcome the opportunity to continue an open dialogue on these matters.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This is not the first time Instacart has faced legal issues over its service fees. In 2017, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/03\/23\/instacart-has-agreed-to-settle-a-class-action-lawsuit-for-4-6-million\/\">Instacart settled a $4.6 million suit<\/a> regarding claims that the company misclassified its personal shoppers as independent contractors, and also failed to reimburse them for work expenses. As part of the settlement, Instacart was required to change the way it described a service fee, which many people mistakenly thought meant tip. Even when Instacart clarified the language, the suit alleges Instacart still buried the option to tip.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In this respect, Instacart\u2019s checkout design compounded consumers\u2019 tendency to confuse the service fee with a shopper tip,&#8221; the suit alleges.<\/p>\n<p>This lawsuit comes as Instacart is facing uncertainty in California over the way it classifies some of its shoppers and delivery people. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/09\/18\/california-governor-gavin-newsom-signs-gig-worker-bill-ab5-into-law\/\">Despite a new law<\/a> going into effect in January that clearly lays out what type of workers should and should not be classified as independent contractors, Instacart has yet to classify its workers as employees. Instead, Instacart, along with Uber, Lyft and DoorDash, are backing a ballot measure, Prop 22, that seeks to keep their workers classified as independent contractors.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Instacart is facing a lawsuit from Washington, D.C.

The three biggest fires, the LNU Lightning Complex, SCU Lightning Complex and CZU Lightning Complex, have collectively destroyed 1,225 structures and claimed the lives of five people, according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sfchronicle.com\/projects\/california-fire-map\/\">San Francisco Chronicle&#8217;s fire tracker<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In light of the wildfires and other anticipated climate change-related disasters, Instacart workers want the company to provide disaster pay at a daily rate equal to the average rate of daily pay, including tips, over the previous 30 days for each day Instacart&#8217;s operations are shutdown. Additionally, GWC wants Instacart to shut down its operations in markets where a city has declared a state of emergency or issued evacuations.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Thousands of gig workers in California alone have been displaced, or seen the demand for their services dwindle in the face of natural disasters,&#8221; GWC wrote on Medium today. &#8220;Instacart can unilaterally shut down operations without paying its impacted workforce a dime, leaving displaced workers to fend for themselves. It is shameful that a company that became profitable for the first time during the pandemic off of the backs of its workers, has abandoned those very same workers during their time of need.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>These demands come shortly after <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sfchronicle.com\/business\/article\/Instacart-agrees-to-pay-health-care-and-sick-15511338.php\">Instacart agreed to distribute $727,985 among some San Francisco-based Instacart workers<\/a> as part of a settlement pertaining to health care and paid sick leave benefits.<\/p>\n<p>This group of workers also argues Instacart workers should be classified as employees, which would make them entitled to certain benefits, like paid sick leave, health care, unemployment benefits and more.<\/p>\n<p>TechCrunch has reached out to Instacart for comment.

Earlier today, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lyft.com\/blog\/posts\/ca-operations-update\">Lyft penned a blog post saying it will shutdown tonight<\/a>. Clearly, Lyft jumped the gun on this one.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;While we won\u2019t have to suspend operations tonight, we do need to continue fighting for independence plus benefits for drivers,&#8221; a Lyft spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;That\u2019s the solution on the ballot in November, and it\u2019s the solution drivers want because it preserves their ability to earn and to use the platform as they do now \u2014 whenever they want \u2014 while also getting historic new benefits. Without it, 80-90% of Californians who earn on app-based platforms will lose that opportunity.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This month, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/06\/uber-lyft-preliminary-injunction-hearing\/\">both Uber and Lyft argued in court that they should be able to continue classifying their drivers as independent contractors<\/a>. A judge disagreed, and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/10\/ca-judge-grants-preliminary-injunction-forcing-uber-and-lyft-to-reclassify-drivers-as-employees\/\">granted a preliminary injunction<\/a> to force both companies to reclassify their drivers as employees beginning Friday. In response, both Uber and Lyft said they would be forced to temporarily pause operations in California. Yesterday, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said on a podcast that the company can&#8217;t simply hire all 50,000 of its drivers overnight.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;All of our model, everything that we have built is based on this platform that brings earners and brings people who want transportation or delivery together,&#8221; he said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.voxmediaevents.com\/schooled\/conferences\">on a Vox Media podcast yesterday<\/a>. &#8220;You can\u2019t flip that stuff overnight. It\u2019ll take time, and we will figure out a way to be in California. We want to be in California. But if the court case comes in, then we\u2019ll have to shut down, and we\u2019ve got the best engineers in the world figuring out how we can rebuild this thing. If we do have to go to employment model, what\u2019s going to happen is that we will then have to underwrite driver productivity. There will be far fewer drivers employed, so my guess is 70-80% of users who use Uber for flexibility, they drove 5 to 10 hours, etc., they will not be able to earn. The prices are going to go up. They\u2019re going to go up less in city centers. So I think SF prices will go up by 20%. Smaller cities prices will go way up.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>What Uber is proposing with Prop 22 is essentially a third way of classifying gig workers, but co-founder of Gig Workers Collective Vanessa Bain says a third way &#8220;is bullshit,&#8221; she said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.voxmediaevents.com\/schooled\/conferences\">on the same Vox Media podcast yesterday<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s categorically less than what we&#8217;re entitled to under current law,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>Below is a timeline of what&#8217;s led to this moment.<\/p>\n<p><b>January 1, 2020:\u00a0<\/b>Assembly Bill 5 becomes law. The bill, first introduced in December 2018, codified the ruling established in Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v Superior Court of Los Angeles. In that case, the court applied the ABC test and decided Dynamex wrongfully classified its workers as independent contractors. According to the ABC test, in order for a hiring entity to legally classify a worker as an independent contractor, it must prove (A) the worker is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity, (B) performs work outside the scope of the entity\u2019s business and (C) is regularly engaged in an \u201cindependently established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as the work performed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><b>May 2020<\/b><strong>:\u00a0<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/05\/uber-lyft-lawsuit-california-worker-misclassification\/\">California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, along with city attorneys from Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco<\/a>, filed a lawsuit asserting Uber and Lyft gain an unfair and unlawful competitive advantage by misclassifying workers as independent contractors.<\/p>\n<p>The suit argues Uber and Lyft are depriving workers the right to minimum wage, overtime, access to paid sick leave, disability insurance and unemployment insurance. The lawsuit, filed in the Superior Court of San Francisco, seeks $2,500 in penalties for each violation, possibly per driver, under the California Unfair Competition Law, and another $2,500 for violations against senior citizens or people with disabilities.<\/p>\n<p><b>June 2020:\u00a0<\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/oag.ca.gov\/news\/press-releases\/attorney-general-becerra-and-city-attorneys-los-angeles-san-diego-and-san-0\">Becerra and others file a motion<\/a>\u00a0for a preliminary injunction seeking to force Uber and Lyft to immediately classify their drivers as employees.<\/p>\n<p><b>August 6, 2020:\u00a0<\/b>California Superior Court Judge Ethan P. Schulman hears arguments pertaining to the preliminary injunction. At the hearing, Uber and Lyft maintained that an injunction would require them to restructure their businesses in such a material way that it would prevent them from being able to employ many drivers on either a full-time or part-time basis. Uber and Lyft\u2019s argument, effectively, is that classifying drivers as employees would result in job loss.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe proposed injunction would cause irreparable injury to Lyft and Uber, and would actually cause massive harm to drivers and harm to riders,\u201d Rohit Singla, counsel for Lyft, said at the hearing.<\/p>\n<p>For example, Lyft estimates it would cost hundreds of millions of dollars simply to process the I-9 forms, which verify employment eligibility. It doesn\u2019t cost anything to file that form, but it would require Uber and Lyft to further invest in their human resources and payroll processes.<\/p>\n<p><b>August 9, 2020:\u00a0<\/b>Judge Schulman grants the preliminary injunction, which goes into effect on August 20, 2020.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Court is under no illusion that implementation of its injunction will be costly,\u201d Judge Schulman wrote in the order. \u201cThere can be no question that in order for Defendants to comply with A.B. 5, they will have to change the nature of their business practices in significant ways, such as by hiring human resources staff to hire and manage their driver workforces.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/10\/ca-judge-grants-preliminary-injunction-forcing-uber-and-lyft-to-reclassify-drivers-as-employees\/\">Uber and Lyft made clear their respective plans to file emergency appeals<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><b>August 12, 2020:\u00a0<\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/12\/uber-ceo-says-service-faces-temporary-shutdown-in-california-over-worker-reclassification-ruling\/\">Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi says<\/a>\u00a0Uber will have to temporarily shut down in California if the court doesn\u2019t overturn the preliminary injunction.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/8\/12\/21364929\/uber-california-shutdown-appeal-court-ruling-drivers\">Lyft says<\/a>\u00a0it, too, will be forced to temporarily cease operations in California.<\/p>\n<p><b>August 13, 2020:\u00a0<\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/13\/uber-and-lyft-lose-bid-to-delay-worker-reclassification-order-in-california\/\">Judge Schulman denies Uber and Lyft\u2019s appeal<\/a>.

work with law enforcement agencies, or supply their tech to them. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/amazon\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"amazon\">Amazon&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> doorbell camera company Ring <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2020\/jun\/09\/amazon-black-lives-matter-police-ring-jeff-bezos\">has partnered with more than 1,300 police departments<\/a> and Amazon Web Services sells its product to U.S. Immigration and Customers Enforcement. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/22\/google-employees-demand-company-stop-selling-tech-to-police\/\">Google sells its G Suite tools to police departments,<\/a> Microsoft has contracts in place with Seattle police and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/microsoft\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"microsoft\">Microsoft <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>-owned GitHub also has partnerships in place with ICE. There&#8217;s also Nextdoor, which partners with police departments through its Agencies app.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s partnerships like those that have prompted the creation of the <a href=\"https:\/\/techisnotneutral.com\/\">Tech Is Not Neutral<\/a> campaign, which is spearheaded by Kairos Fellowship in partnership with The Movement for Black Lives, Media Justice and others.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Seeing how tech companies were responding to the uprising for Black liberation and the Black Lives Matter movement &#8212; there were a bunch of CEOs saying Black Lives Matter or making whatever statement, but we have seen how tech companies interplay with our lives and our democracy,&#8221; Kairos Fellowship campaign manager Jelani Drew-Davi told TechCrunch. &#8220;Tech companies&#8217; products have real-life consequences for people, and for Black and people of color, we are the ones most affected by technology when it doesn&#8217;t work for us. This campaign&#8217;s aim is to make it work for us.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The campaign kicked off in early July with an open letter written to big tech CEOs. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kairosfellows.org\/new-blog\/2020\/6\/30\/testing-headline-2gyrm\">The letter<\/a>, addressed to leaders at Amazon, Microsoft, Nextdoor and Google, urges them to take action for Black lives. But the campaign&#8217;s main focus right now is on <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/nextdoor\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"nextdoor\">Nextdoor <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and Microsoft, Drew-Davi said. In June, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/06\/23\/us\/nextdoor-forward-to-police-.html\">Nextdoor turned off its feature that allows people to forward information to police<\/a>, but the folks at the Tech Is Not Neutral campaign say more needs to be done.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Nextdoor connects thousands of people in neighborhoods and they&#8217;ve had a super well-documented racism problem for years,&#8221; Drew-Davi said. &#8220;That, combined with partnerships with police, gives people this one-way street for reporting Black people to police. That&#8217;s a problem. The response from Nextdoor has been we&#8217;ll train moderators, but they have not said we&#8217;ll cut ties with police, which is the number one thing they could do to protect Black people on their platform.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>With Microsoft, in addition to contracts with Seattle&#8217;s police department, the company is also battling for a $10 billion contract with the U.S. Department of Defense. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/tech\/tech-news\/thousands-contracts-highlight-quiet-ties-between-big-tech-u-s-n1233171\">Microsoft has had more than 5,000 subcontracts with the DoD and other law enforcement agencies since 2016<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;Microsoft has been so deeply intertwined with our government and policing around the country on local state and federal levels and they\u2019re quiet about it,&#8221; Drew-Davi said. &#8220;And we didn&#8217;t know about it until <a href=\"https:\/\/techinquiry.org\/SiliconValley-Military\/\">that article<\/a> came out. Microsoft is an important company to watch. The more we can uncover this and shine a spotlight on Microsoft, the more people recognize what these household names are doing that harm us.&#8221;<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The immediate next steps for the campaign are to pursue conversations with these companies, come up with specific demands and escalate them, if companies don&#8217;t agree to them, Kairos Fellowship executive director Mariana Ruiz Firmat told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This feels so important to us because it&#8217;s often the idea of neutral that tech company&#8217;s hide behind to allow racism and their platforms to be used in ways that spread authoritarianism or disrupt our democracy,&#8221; Firmat said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a long-term battle but we want to change the way in which we understand the role of tech companies and change the idea of neutral to being biased.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft declined to comment for this story, and Nextdoor, Google and Amazon did not respond to our request for comment.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are a number of tech companies that either directly work with law enforcement agencies, or supply their tech to them.

A judge disagreed, and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/10\/ca-judge-grants-preliminary-injunction-forcing-uber-and-lyft-to-reclassify-drivers-as-employees\/\">granted a preliminary injunction<\/a> to force both companies to reclassify their drivers as employees beginning Friday. In response, both Uber and Lyft said they would be forced to temporarily pause operations in California.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Yesterday, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/uber\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"uber\">Uber <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said on a podcast that the company can&#8217;t simply hire all 50,000 of its drivers overnight.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;All of our model, everything that we have built is based on this platform that brings earners and brings people who want transportation or delivery together,&#8221; he said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.voxmediaevents.com\/schooled\/conferences\">on a Vox Media podcast yesterday<\/a>. &#8220;You can\u2019t flip that stuff overnight. It\u2019ll take time, and we will figure out a way to be in California. We want to be in California. But if the court case comes in, then we\u2019ll have to shut down, and we\u2019ve got the best engineers in the world figuring out how we can rebuild this thing. If we do have to go to employment model, what\u2019s going to happen is that we will then have to underwrite driver productivity. There will be far fewer drivers employed, so my guess is 70-80% of users who use Uber for flexibility, they drove 5 to 10 hours, etc., they will not be able to earn. The prices are going to go up. They\u2019re going to go up less in city centers. So I think SF prices will go up by 20%. Smaller cities prices will go way up.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>What Uber is proposing with Prop 22 is essentially a third way of classifying gig workers, but co-founder of Gig Workers Collective Vanessa Bain says a third way &#8220;is bullshit,&#8221; she said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.voxmediaevents.com\/schooled\/conferences\">on the same Vox Media podcast yesterday<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s categorically less than what we&#8217;re entitled to under current law,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>TechCrunch has reached out to Uber to see if the company has made a decision yet regarding California. We&#8217;ll update this story when we hear back.<\/p>\n<p>Below is a timeline of what&#8217;s led to this moment.<\/p>\n<p><b>January 1, 2020:\u00a0<\/b>Assembly Bill 5 becomes law. The bill, first introduced in December 2018, codified the ruling established in Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v Superior Court of Los Angeles. In that case, the court applied the ABC test and decided Dynamex wrongfully classified its workers as independent contractors. According to the ABC test, in order for a hiring entity to legally classify a worker as an independent contractor, it must prove (A) the worker is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity, (B) performs work outside the scope of the entity\u2019s business and (C) is regularly engaged in an \u201cindependently established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as the work performed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><b>May 2020<\/b><strong>:\u00a0<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/05\/uber-lyft-lawsuit-california-worker-misclassification\/\">California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, along with city attorneys from Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco<\/a>, filed a lawsuit asserting Uber and Lyft gain an unfair and unlawful competitive advantage by misclassifying workers as independent contractors.<\/p>\n<p>The suit argues Uber and Lyft are depriving workers the right to minimum wage, overtime, access to paid sick leave, disability insurance and unemployment insurance. The lawsuit, filed in the Superior Court of San Francisco, seeks $2,500 in penalties for each violation, possibly per driver, under the California Unfair Competition Law, and another $2,500 for violations against senior citizens or people with disabilities.<\/p>\n<p><b>June 2020:\u00a0<\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/oag.ca.gov\/news\/press-releases\/attorney-general-becerra-and-city-attorneys-los-angeles-san-diego-and-san-0\">Becerra and others file a motion<\/a>\u00a0for a preliminary injunction seeking to force Uber and Lyft to immediately classify their drivers as employees.<\/p>\n<p><b>August 6, 2020:\u00a0<\/b>California Superior Court Judge Ethan P. Schulman hears arguments pertaining to the preliminary injunction. At the hearing, Uber and Lyft maintained that an injunction would require them to restructure their businesses in such a material way that it would prevent them from being able to employ many drivers on either a full-time or part-time basis. Uber and Lyft\u2019s argument, effectively, is that classifying drivers as employees would result in job loss.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe proposed injunction would cause irreparable injury to Lyft and Uber, and would actually cause massive harm to drivers and harm to riders,\u201d Rohit Singla, counsel for Lyft, said at the hearing.<\/p>\n<p>For example, Lyft estimates it would cost hundreds of millions of dollars simply to process the I-9 forms, which verify employment eligibility. It doesn\u2019t cost anything to file that form, but it would require Uber and Lyft to further invest in their human resources and payroll processes.<\/p>\n<p><b>August 9, 2020:\u00a0<\/b>Judge Schulman grants the preliminary injunction, which goes into effect on August 20, 2020.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Court is under no illusion that implementation of its injunction will be costly,\u201d Judge Schulman wrote in the order. \u201cThere can be no question that in order for Defendants to comply with A.B. 5, they will have to change the nature of their business practices in significant ways, such as by hiring human resources staff to hire and manage their driver workforces.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/10\/ca-judge-grants-preliminary-injunction-forcing-uber-and-lyft-to-reclassify-drivers-as-employees\/\">Uber and Lyft made clear their respective plans to file emergency appeals<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><b>August 12, 2020:\u00a0<\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/12\/uber-ceo-says-service-faces-temporary-shutdown-in-california-over-worker-reclassification-ruling\/\">Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi says<\/a>\u00a0Uber will have to temporarily shut down in California if the court doesn\u2019t overturn the preliminary injunction.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/8\/12\/21364929\/uber-california-shutdown-appeal-court-ruling-drivers\">Lyft says<\/a>\u00a0it, too, will be forced to temporarily cease operations in California.<\/p>\n<p><b>August 13, 2020:\u00a0<\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/13\/uber-and-lyft-lose-bid-to-delay-worker-reclassification-order-in-california\/\">Judge Schulman denies Uber and Lyft\u2019s appeal<\/a>.

journey of a kids book startup that tackles topics like racism, cancer and divorce"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">Jelani Memory, an entrepreneur<\/span> and father, had been wanting to write a kids book for years. While in the midst of raising a Series B round for his startup Circle Media, he started to feel burned out and wanted to start doing something more creatively fulfilling, Memory told me. That&#8217;s what led Memory to create A Kids Book About, a book publishing platform to help parents tackle tough topics and conversations with their kids. Its first book was &#8220;<a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/a-kids-book-about\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"a-kids-book-about\">A Kids Book About <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Racism.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It was really me as a dad trying to keep that conversation going with my kids, and my kids thought the book was cool,&#8221; Memory said. &#8220;And it caused them to ask all sorts of new questions that I hadn&#8217;t heard them ask before around the topic of racism.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Memory then shared that book with friends and colleagues, who suggested he write more books about other topics.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s really when the seed was planted,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When you find yourself waking up in the morning thinking about something and going to bed at night thinking about it, and in the middle of your workday, when you&#8217;re supposed to be doing work, sort of obsessing over it, I just sort of intuitively knew that these books needed to exist &#8212; at the very least for my own kids &#8212; because I knew that some conversations really are too hard to have. And while I consider myself a pretty open dad and talk about a lot with my kids, some of those conversations are just too hard to bring up, or if you&#8217;re ready to bring them up, you don&#8217;t know what to say.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That seems to have struck a chord with the masses. The day after George Floyd was killed by police, A Kids Book About did as much in sales at it had the whole previous month. And it didn&#8217;t slow down, Memory said. The following day, sales went up 2x, and the day after, went up another 2x and held steady. So, within the span of 10 days, A Kids Book About saw north of $1 million in revenue.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And to be quite honest, we had enough inventory that was supposed to last us the rest of the year,&#8221; Memory said. But we sold out of every single one of our titles except for two.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>At a certain point in June, there were abut 50,000 books on backorder.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Grownups were really stepping up to have these meaningful conversations with their kids,&#8221; Memory said. &#8220;And while our book on racism did really well, our customers are just remarkable and they were snagging our book on cancer and feminism and empathy and mindfulness. It was really cool to watch.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>A Kids Book About officially launched in 2019 with 12 titles released in October. Today, there are 25 titles available, with plans for more on the way. The startup is primarily a direct to consumer business with a &#8220;fairly unique and novel publishing model,&#8221; Memory said.<\/p>\n<p>A Kids Book About writes all of its books via a workshop in a single day. The company brings in an author, talks through the vision and mission as a company and then co-writes the book with that author. A Kids Book About intentionally looks for folks who have not yet published books, though, there are authors on the platform who have previously published books.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It just tends to be that if you&#8217;ve already published, you almost always are certainly a straight, white male,&#8221; Memory said. &#8220;So for us, we look for folks with a deep personal story and someone who knows their topic inside and out through their lived experience.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2032594\" style=\"width: 5754px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2032594\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2032594 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/1-Brand-Hero.jpg\" alt=\"a kids book about books\" width=\"5744\" height=\"3829\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/1-Brand-Hero.jpg 5744w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/1-Brand-Hero.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/1-Brand-Hero.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/1-Brand-Hero.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/1-Brand-Hero.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/1-Brand-Hero.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/1-Brand-Hero.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/1-Brand-Hero.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 5744px) 100vw, 5744px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2032594\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> A Kids Book About<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>On the publishing side, A Kids Book About gives authors no less than 10% of the revenue from book sales, while traditional publishers may give around 6%, Memory said. It also takes, on average, 45 days to go to market, as opposed to 18 months in the traditional publishing world, Memory said.<\/p>\n<p>When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, A Kids Book About realized it needed to tackle this topic. So it green-lit and created a book within four days with a social epidemiologist as a free e-book. The physical book is available on pre-order for next month.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, amid the massive social movement sparked by Floyd&#8217;s death, the company realized it needed additional books on the topic of race.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;While my book is a great conversation starter on racism, we realized there are a couple of others books we really need to make,&#8221; Memory said. &#8220;So we&#8217;re fast-tracking a book about white privilege that will come out this fall and a book about systemic racism as a way to sort of round out that conversation.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Another untraditional aspect of the business is A Kids Book About&#8217;s approach to fundraising. Part of that process meant choosing his investors as much as them choosing him, Memory said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;That means avoiding a lot of conversations, it meant saying no to some checks,&#8221; Memory said. &#8220;But it really meant going out and finding more Black and brown investors.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Memory also sought out investors where this deal would be its first investment in a startup.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;That was really important that I wasn&#8217;t just taking accredited investors but making room for unaccredited investors as well, knowing that if the wealth loop just keeps going the way that it is, only people with money get to make more money,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>A Kids Book About raised $1 million from a handful of seed funds, including Cascade Seed Fund, Color Capital and Black Founders Matter.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And I can tell you, pitching a direct consumer kids book startup that tackles topics like cancer and racism is not super hot in the venture,&#8221; Memory said. &#8220;And being a founder of color, even as a second-time founder, you know, I can&#8217;t tell you how many folks recommended that I should talk to impact investors. And I was like, &#8216;I don&#8217;t think you understand what I&#8217;m doing here. This isn&#8217;t a charity.&#8217; But it was very easy to avoid and say no to those investors.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Overall, Memory said his business resonated pretty well with investors, with the exception of e-commerce or consumer-focused funds. Sometimes it came down to the investors not having a strong grasp on the publishing industry or to how new the business was, he said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I think most investors fancy themselves as risk takers, but I think investors are the most risk-averse on the planet,&#8221; Memory said. &#8220;And also, the game of fundraising really is about finding those true believers who really get what you&#8217;re up to. I am still a little bit amazed we raised $1 million for this business knowing that half of the money was raised right smack dab in the middle of quarantine lockdown in the pandemic. But, you know, I don&#8217;t think it hurt that we started to post just remarkable numbers. And a lot of those folks we were already in conversation with at the time. And by the time we were doing half a million every few days, I ended up saying no to quite a few investors who I either thought weren&#8217;t a fit for us or simply we didn&#8217;t have the allocation for.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Jelani Memory, an entrepreneur and father, had been wanting to write a kids book for years.

He said Wishom stood out for several reasons.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;She\u2019s an expert in creating positive and inspirational content for global audiences, and a passionate advocate for building a company culture of respect, integrity, inclusion and support \u2014 areas in which we must innovate and improve,&#8221; Silbermann said. &#8220;Andrea has spent her career outside of Silicon Valley and has a vision for reimagining the board\/employee relationship.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This announcement comes a couple of days after <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/14\/pinterest-employees-are-walking-out-today-in-light-of-discrimination-allegations\/\">Pinterest employees staged a virtual walkout<\/a> to demand systemic change as it relates to gender and racial discrimination. The walkout was a direct response to former Pinterest employees speaking out against gender and racial discrimination. Last week, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/11\/former-coo-sues-pinterest-accusing-it-of-gender-discrimination-retaliation-and-wrongful-termination\/\">former Pinterest COO Fran\u00e7oise Brougher sued<\/a>\u00a0the company, alleging gender discrimination, retaliation and wrongful termination. Prior to that,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/erikashimizu\/status\/1272547227177713664\">Aerica Shimizu Banks<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ifeomaozoma\/status\/1272546213322080258\">Ifeoma Ozoma<\/a>\u00a0also accused Pinterest of discrimination.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThese are not isolated cases,\u201d workers wrote in a petition. \u201cInstead, they are representative of an organizational culture that hurts all Pinterest workers, and keeps us from achieving our mission of bringing everyone the inspiration to create a life they love. We recognize that Pinterest has been a leader in diversity and inclusive hiring, with the diversity goals for new hires. It\u2019s become clear that this is not enough, and that the diversity goals need to apply from the top down, not just the bottom up. Not only will diverse and inclusive leadership prevent discrimination and harassment among workers, it will help us build a product that is relevant on a global scale.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Employees are demanding full transparency about promotion levels and retention, total compensation package transparency, the people within two layers of reporting to the CEO to be at least 25% women and 8% underrepresented employees and a commitment to a diversity goal for the third layer reporting to the CEO.<\/p>\n<p>*An earlier version of this story incorrectly said Skywalker Holdings is a trampoline company.

The bill, first introduced in December 2018, codified the ruling established in Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v Superior Court of Los Angeles. In that case, the court applied the ABC test and decided Dynamex wrongfully classified its workers as independent contractors. According to the ABC test, in order for a hiring entity to legally classify a worker as an independent contractor, it must prove (A) the worker is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity, (B) performs work outside the scope of the entity\u2019s business and (C) is regularly engaged in an \u201cindependently established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as the work performed.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>May 2020<\/b><strong>: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/05\/uber-lyft-lawsuit-california-worker-misclassification\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, along with city attorneys from Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, filed a lawsuit asserting Uber and Lyft gain an unfair and unlawful competitive advantage by misclassifying workers as independent contractors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit argues Uber and Lyft are depriving workers the right to minimum wage, overtime, access to paid sick leave, disability insurance and unemployment insurance. The lawsuit, filed in the Superior Court of San Francisco, seeks $2,500 in penalties for each violation, possibly per driver, under the California Unfair Competition Law, and another $2,500 for violations against senior citizens or people with disabilities.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>June 2020: <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/oag.ca.gov\/news\/press-releases\/attorney-general-becerra-and-city-attorneys-los-angeles-san-diego-and-san-0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Becerra and others file a motion<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for a preliminary injunction seeking to force Uber and Lyft to immediately classify their drivers as employees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>August 6, 2020: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California Superior Court Judge Ethan P. Schulman hears arguments pertaining to the preliminary injunction. At the hearing, Uber and Lyft maintained that an injunction would require them to restructure their businesses in such a material way that it would prevent them from being able to employ many drivers on either a full-time or part-time basis. Uber and Lyft\u2019s argument, effectively, is that classifying drivers as employees would result in job loss.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe proposed injunction would cause irreparable injury to Lyft and Uber, and would actually cause massive harm to drivers and harm to riders,\u201d Rohit Singla, counsel for Lyft, said at the hearing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, Lyft estimates it would cost hundreds of millions of dollars simply to process the I-9 forms, which verify employment eligibility. It doesn\u2019t cost anything to file that form, but it would require Uber and Lyft to further invest in their human resources and payroll processes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>August 9, 2020: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Judge Schulman grants the preliminary injunction, which goes into effect on August 20, 2020.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe Court is under no illusion that implementation of its injunction will be costly,\u201d Judge Schulman wrote in the order. \u201cThere can be no question that in order for Defendants to comply with A.B. 5, they will have to change the nature of their business practices in significant ways, such as by hiring human resources staff to hire and manage their driver workforces.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/10\/ca-judge-grants-preliminary-injunction-forcing-uber-and-lyft-to-reclassify-drivers-as-employees\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uber and Lyft made clear their respective plans to file emergency appeals<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>August 12, 2020: <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/12\/uber-ceo-says-service-faces-temporary-shutdown-in-california-over-worker-reclassification-ruling\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi says<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Uber will have to temporarily shut down in California if the court doesn\u2019t overturn the preliminary injunction. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/8\/12\/21364929\/uber-california-shutdown-appeal-court-ruling-drivers\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lyft says<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> it, too, will be forced to temporarily cease operations in California.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>August 13, 2020: <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/13\/uber-and-lyft-lose-bid-to-delay-worker-reclassification-order-in-california\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Judge Schulman denies Uber and Lyft\u2019s appeal<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Prop 22 aims to keep gig workers classified as independent contractors. The measure, if passed, would make drivers and delivery workers for said companies exempt from a new state law that classifies them as W-2 employees.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ballot measure looks to implement an earnings guarantee of at least 120% of minimum wage while on the job, 30 cents per mile for expenses, a healthcare stipend, occupational accident insurance for on-the-job injuries, protection against discrimination and sexual harassment and automobile accident and liability insurance.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Stay Woke<\/b><\/h2>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>Pinterest\u2019s fall from grace<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Back in 2015, Pinterest was known as one of the companies doing some of the best work around diversity, equity and inclusion. That perception changed this year.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pinterest was one of the first tech companies to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/07\/30\/pinterest-is-working-with-a-startup-called-paradigm-to-foster-diversity\/\">set concrete hiring goals.<\/a> In 2015, those goals were to increase hiring rates for full-time engineering roles to 30% female; increase hiring rates for full-time engineers to 8% from underrepresented ethnic backgrounds; increase hiring rates for non-engineering roles to 12% underrepresented backgrounds; and implement a Rooney Rule requirement where at least one person from an underrepresented background and one female candidate is interviewed for every open leadership position.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"H28t5GfL7V\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/12\/16\/pinterest-diversity\/\">Pinterest has lowered its hiring goals for women in engineering roles<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Pinterest has lowered its hiring goals for women in engineering roles&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/12\/16\/pinterest-diversity\/embed\/#?secret=H28t5GfL7V\" data-secret=\"H28t5GfL7V\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"pinterest\">Pinterest <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> was also one of the first companies to hire a head of diversity and inclusion. In 2016, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/01\/06\/pinterest-hires-its-first-ever-head-of-diversity\/\">Pinterest hired Candice Morgan for the role<\/a>. Morgan left the company earlier this year and joined VC firm GV as its equity, diversity and inclusion partner. Still, Morgan had one of the longest stints at any tech company&#8217;s diversity and inclusion department.<\/p>\n<p>In the company&#8217;s 2020 diversity report, Pinterest showed it beat all of its hiring goals, but what was missing from that report was retention data. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/16\/pinterests-diversity-report-is-missing-some-key-data\/\">When TechCrunch asked in January<\/a> if they would make the data available, a Pinterest spokesperson said, \u201cunfortunately, we can\u2019t share the retention metrics publicly, but it will continue to be an internal priority.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Now, transparency about retention data is just one of a handful of demands Pinterest employees have. Two days ago, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/11\/former-coo-sues-pinterest-accusing-it-of-gender-discrimination-retaliation-and-wrongful-termination\/\">former Pinterest COO Fran\u00e7oise Brougher sued<\/a>\u00a0the company, alleging gender discrimination, retaliation and wrongful termination. Prior to that,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/erikashimizu\/status\/1272547227177713664\">Aerica Shimizu Banks<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ifeomaozoma\/status\/1272546213322080258\">Ifeoma Ozoma<\/a>, also accused Pinterest of discrimination.<\/p>\n<p>In light of those allegations, Pinterest employees are walking out today to demand change at the company. The walkout is directly in response to recent accusations of racial and gender discrimination at Pinterest. In addition to the walkout,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.coworker.org\/petitions\/put-an-end-to-all-forms-of-discrimination-and-retaliation-at-pinterest-1\">there\u2019s a petition circulating throughout the company demanding systemic change<\/a>. The change they seek entails full transparency about promotion levels and retention, total compensation package transparency and for the people within two layers of reporting to the CEO to be at least 25% women and 8% underrepresented employees.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Don&#8217;t Miss<\/strong><\/h2>\n<hr \/>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/12\/triplebyte-incubates-colorstack-to-increase-black-and-latinx-representation-in-cs-programs\/\">Triplebyte incubates ColorStack to increase Black and Latinx representation in CS programs<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/14\/diversity-equity-inclusion-overview\/\">A beginner&#8217;s guide to diversity, equity and inclusion<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome back to Human Capital.

An example of this is a white person who calls out racism in the workplace.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ally:\u00a0<\/strong>A more passive version of an accomplice. An example of an ally is someone who supports the cause but may not put themselves on the line.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Anti-racist:\u00a0<\/strong>&#8220;To be antiracist is to think nothing is behaviorally wrong or right \u2014 inferior or superior \u2014 with any of the racial groups. Whenever the antiracist sees individuals behaving positively or negatively, the antiracist sees exactly that: individuals behaving positively or negatively, not representatives of whole races. To be antiracist is to deracialize behavior, to remove the tattooed stereotype from every racialized body.&#8221; &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ibramxkendi.com\/how-to-be-an-antiracist-1\">Ibram X. Kendi<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>BIPOC:\u00a0<\/strong>Black, Indigenous and people of color. This term is an alternative to simply saying &#8220;people of color,&#8221; which fails to recognize the unique experiences and hardships of Black (slavery) and Indigenous (genocide) folks in the U.S.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cisgender:\u00a0<\/strong>Person whose gender matches their sex assigned at birth.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Culture fit:\u00a0<\/strong>Code for &#8220;looks like me, thinks like me,&#8221; which can lead to homogeneous workplaces.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Diversity report: <\/strong>An oftentimes yearly report where tech companies show their employee demographic breakdown.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Equality:\u00a0<\/strong>Treating everyone the same, regardless of any structural barriers of discrimination.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Equity: <\/strong>Treating people in fair and just ways that take into account systemic discrimination and other structural barriers.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Gender nonconforming:\u00a0<\/strong>People who identify with no specific gender.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Imposter syndrome:\u00a0<\/strong>When individuals doubt their worth and accomplishments and fear being exposed as a fraud.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Intersectionality: <\/strong>The concept that people face multi-faceted layers of discrimination as a result of their intersecting identities relating to race, gender, class, sexual orientation, etc. For women and trans people of color, the oppressive institutions of racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia all come into play and cannot be examined separately.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Microaggression: <\/strong>Casual comments, behaviors or actions that are driven by underlying biases about a particular race, gender, sexuality or other characteristic. A classic example of this is telling a Black person, &#8220;You&#8217;re so articulate!&#8221; or, &#8220;You&#8217;re the whitest Black person I know!&#8221; The former suggests it&#8217;s rare for Black people to be articulate while the latter implies that Black person&#8217;s behavior doesn&#8217;t fit in with society&#8217;s stereotypical ideas of Blackness.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Performative:\u00a0<\/strong>Engaging in woke speak without taking action.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Pipeline problem:<\/strong> A misconception that the lack of diversity in tech is a result of too few Black and Latinx people interested in technology.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Transgender:\u00a0<\/strong>Person whose gender identity does not match their sex assigned at birth.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Unconscious bias:\u00a0<\/strong>Also known as implicit biases, these are underlying beliefs people have about certain groups of people that are powered by stereotypes. Over the years, however, some have argued that these types of biases are not all that unconscious.<\/li>\n<li><strong>White privilege:\u00a0<\/strong>The benefits and advantages that people have simply for being white in society. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tolerance.org\/magazine\/fall-2018\/what-is-white-privilege-really\">More here<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Woke:\u00a0<\/strong>Aware of social justice and racial justice issues in society.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<hr \/>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">DE&amp;I Landscape<\/h3>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Diversity, inclusion and equity do not just mean hiring and recruiting Black and brown folks.

When the company first launched, a major goal was to have a significant impact on diversity in terms of race and gender, TripleByte co-founder and CEO Ammon Bartram told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;One-and-a-half years in, I was surprised and unhappy to see that, in terms of race and gender, our results looked pretty much identical to startups. We had a big impact on socioeconomic opportunity, but the big identity categories of race and gender were in the same depressing ratios of Silicon Valley&#8217;s traditional ratio.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Bartram said he began talking to his advisors about the issue and that&#8217;s when Y Combinator CEO and partner Michael Seibel, who is a board member at Triplebyte, encouraged Bartram to think outside of the box. Seibel encouraged Bartram to treat the problem like a startup and to try new things, Bartram said.<\/p>\n<p>Triplebyte considered things like sponsoring Grace Hopper, or bringing in a head of diversity, &#8220;but the truth of the matter is, the majority of larger companies do these things but the percentage of Black and Latinx engineers has barely increased over the years,&#8221; Bartram said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The status quo is broken and not working,&#8221; Bartram said. &#8220;People have done great work but it&#8217;s still not working.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This is how Triplebyte found its way to ColorStack. What stood out about them was the success they were already having.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It can be a bleak field &#8212; diversity and inclusion,&#8221; Bartram said. &#8220;There&#8217;s been so little change in the stats. But one thing that has been shown to work is mentorship. Role models, people who look like you, have a huge impact on people staying in tech and not leaving. But the mentorship role model, with people who look like them, has a huge impact on people choosing a mentor, staying involved and not leaving.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Through the incubation, ColorStack will remain independent while also not having to worry about funding. Additionally, Triplebyte pays Petty a salary and provided ColorStack with operating funds for two years.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If it goes well, we might extend it,&#8221; Bartram said. &#8220;My goal here is for Jehron to succeed. There&#8217;s lots of synergy between what we&#8217;re doing. We&#8217;re a for-profit company but we&#8217;re pretty mission driven. I&#8217;m doing this because I want to do something more impactful than the work I did in the past. Success would be ColorStack having an impact and doing the work that worked at Cornell and duplicating that at even 10% of the colleges out there.

href=\"https:\/\/www.hellotill.com\/\">Till<\/a> was founded on the premise that people are not always able to pay their rent on the 1st of the month, but might be better suited to paying their rent in smaller payments throughout the month. Through its flexible rent platform, Till creates a customized payment schedule for renters that aligns with their monthly cash flow. Till estimates it can help cut evictions by as much as 50%.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We work to understand that timing and we can look at their expense loads to help them balance if they should be paying more now or more later in the month,&#8221; Till CEO David Sullivan told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>With the funding, Till plans to work on getting more landlords on board across additional states and further develop the flexible rent product. In order for renters to use the platform, their landlords must already be working with Till. To date, Till is live at 170 properties that consist of 30,000 units in total across 14 states.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Since we first learned about Till, we have been extremely impressed by its ability to bridge the gap between the increasingly volatile income and expense patterns of renters and the more rigid financial realities of landlords,&#8221; MetaProp General Partner Zak Schwarzman said in a statement. &#8220;As the uncertainty wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic fallout continues with no clear end in sight, it\u2019s more important than ever that landlords find new, mutually beneficial, ways to work with renters to reduce late fees, minimize evictions and foster renters\u2019 long-term financial health.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Late fees vary by state and by landlord. Sometimes they come in the form of a flat fee or a percentage of your rent. Either way, they&#8217;re punitive.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very punitive fee against a renter having a cash flow issue,&#8221; Sullivan said. &#8220;Even if a renter has the ability to stay in the unit, renters then get overburdened with fees, which makes their ability to pay even more challenging.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>While this product may have more relevance these days, during a time when people are facing severe economic insecurity as a result of COVID-19, Sullivan said this problem is not specific to the pandemic. Though, COVID-19 has exacerbated the issue.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Pre-Covid, you have about $50 billion of delinquent rent a year and renters being charged about $5 billion in late fees,&#8221; Sullivan said. &#8220;That creates a burden on renters. It leads to three million families being evicted in a normal year. And evictions disproportionately impact minority communities.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The business model, however, relies on financial insecurity, as Till&#8217;s target customer is someone who already struggles to make their monthly rental payments. For its flexible rent product, Till charges renters $3 per month if they make all of their payments on time, and $9 per month if they don&#8217;t. Till also offers a rental loan product for renters with varying rates.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We want to create win-win outcomes,&#8221; Sullivan said. &#8220;We fundamentally believe that when you get renters to succeed, landlords succeed to.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Till, a platform that serves as an intermediary between landlords and renters, has raised an $8 million seed round led by Route 66 Ventures, with participation from MetaProp and NextGen Venture Partners.

target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"reddit\">Reddit <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> is gearing up to run ads for President Donald Trump ahead of the 2020 presidential election despite concerns from employees, TechCrunch has learned. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman addressed some of these employee concerns during an all-hands meeting last week, viewed by TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I know for many of you, [Trump] is simply a symbol of hate and there&#8217;s no getting around that &#8212; what he represents,&#8221; Huffman said. &#8220;And as a result, many of you have very real anger towards him or fear of where the country is going or sadness around where the country is going, and believe me, I share a lot of those emotions around the state of our country &#8212; the polarization of political discourse, the inflammatory rhetoric, the incompetence from our government. It feels like we are regressing.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Still, Huffman spoke about how he struggles with trying to reconcile his personal beliefs with his duty as the CEO of Reddit. He pointed to Reddit&#8217;s long history with Trump, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/06\/26\/reddit-quarantines-its-biggest-headache\/\">beginning in the 2016 election with r\/The_Donald .<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Most of our content policy updates have been related to them in some form or fashion, including the most recent one,&#8221; Huffman said.<\/p>\n<p>The decision to allow Trump ads comes <a href=\"https:\/\/redditblog.com\/2020\/06\/01\/remember-the-human-black-lives-matter\/\">within months of Huffman saying Reddit does not tolerate<\/a> &#8220;hate, racism, and violence, and while we have work to do to fight these on our platform, our values are clear.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When I think about Reddit&#8217;s role moving forward and the role we can play in the world, I think the best way to address<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> many of these issues is actually through the upcoming election,&#8221; Huffman said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a number of things we can do and are doing on that end to ensuring a fair election and I think we have a very important role to play. As I mentioned in my email about <a href=\"https:\/\/redditblog.com\/2020\/06\/01\/remember-the-human-black-lives-matter\/\">Black Lives Matter two months ago<\/a>, that we later shared, I think in the election &#8212; this is one of the areas where Reddit can really lean in and make a difference. [&#8230;] I know you might not <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">agree with me on some of these points or follow the logic and I can\u2019t take that away from you and I\u2019m not trying to diminish that in any way. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What I\u2019m trying to do with Reddit is try to reconcile our beliefs with our platform and see if we can be the best participant possible in the upcoming election.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>And that means allowing political ads. The ads will likely take the form of a homepage takeover, which is the top link on the site, but not the display ads on the sidebar, Huffman explained. Additionally, Reddit will allow reserved buys, which will require the Trump campaign to work directly with the sales team. These ads will feature comments to enable users to engage with the ad.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;My hope is that this would shift the conversation or make the conversation more effective &#8212; not just let these ads be a one-way broadcasting mechanism as advertising is elsewhere on the internet but more of a two-way conversation,&#8221; Huffman said.<\/p>\n<p>What Reddit won&#8217;t allow, however, are auctions, which have previously resulted in advertisers essentially bombing the entire site with their ads.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We debated having no political ads at all on Reddit and I<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> certainly think there\u2019s a compelling argument for that but I think that Reddit has the opportunity to elevate the discussion around political ads and a duty to play in the political process,&#8221; Huffman said. &#8220;And I say all of this knowing that this may simply be unacceptable to some of you and I understand why. And in some areas, I can relate to why and in others I can see and hear the pain.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s an opportunity for this to go well and a risk for this not to go well. And I think that\u2019s a risk we accept and we will do our best to mitigate the challenges that we can foresee.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"tu62i7GWdG\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/21\/trump-youtube-election-day-political-ads\/\">Trump&#8217;s Election Day YouTube takeover plan feels very different in 2020<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Trump&#8217;s Election Day YouTube takeover plan feels very different in 2020&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/21\/trump-youtube-election-day-political-ads\/embed\/#?secret=tu62i7GWdG\" data-secret=\"tu62i7GWdG\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Back in April, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/13\/reddit-announces-updates-including-a-new-subreddit-to-increase-political-ad-transparency\/?guccounter=1\">Reddit announced an update to its political advertising policy that requires campaigns to leave comments open on ads for the first 24 hours.<\/a> What Reddit is working on now is a bit different. Currently, Reddit allows advertisers to moderate those comments, but Huffman said that&#8217;s probably not the right move in this context.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll either moderate too much or too little and that will create controversy either way,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And it could be the case that the advertiser wants that, and that controversy would come directly at our expense. So that&#8217;s not a workable solution.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Another option is for Reddit to do comment moderation, but that also poses its risk for controversy. Huffman spoke about how Reddit may then be accused of moderating too much or too little.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;But maybe we can try this other approach, so the other approach would be no direct comments on the ads,&#8221; Huffman said. &#8220;Instead, we would have a sticky comment with a link encouraging users to submit that ad to a specific community for commentary.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The vision, Huffman said, is people would be able to discuss the ad in specific communities on Reddit. Those discussions would then be moderated by the specific community. This feature, however, has yet to be built.<\/p>\n<p>The plan is to start running political ads toward the end of September, with the goal to start testing this new feature in early September to see if it works.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And we are willing to walk away from this deal if that&#8217;s not possible &#8212; if we can&#8217;t hit that bar, if we can&#8217;t build this in time,&#8221; Huffman said.<\/p>\n<p>Huffman seemed optimistic about being able to get this done, saying it&#8217;s not &#8220;prohibitively disruptive&#8221; to any team&#8217;s road maps. Still, he recognized there are other decisions to be made around the election, such as which dates they will allow and won&#8217;t allow campaigns to advertise.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Far and away, I think the most common question I&#8217;ve been asked about the ads themselves is, &#8216;why are we doing this at all?&#8217; Like, &#8216;why don&#8217;t we just say no? It&#8217;s a ton of work. It&#8217;s a huge distraction,&#8217; &#8221; he said. &#8220;[&#8230;] I&#8217;ve shared with you the challenge about separating my personal views from, I think, my and our work at Reddit, the platform. But even when you now look at just kind of the practical decisions we have to make, that&#8217;s a very persuasive argument. At the end of the day, I think that Reddit and politics are deeply intertwined. We will have a role to play in this election no matter what. And political ads are a part of the political process. And if there&#8217;s a chance that Reddit can show another more healthy, more effective way, or add to the political conversation I think we should take it. That is what Reddit does. It&#8217;s not a sure thing and I think there are a variety of ways for this to go wrong, which we are documenting now, and we will do our best to address.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>TechCrunch has reached out to Reddit and will update this story if we hear back.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"VQP1KvIMd2\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/10\/reddit-names-ycs-michael-seibel-to-board-following-co-founder-alexis-ohanians-exit\/\">Reddit names YC\u2019s Michael Seibel to board, following co-founder Alexis Ohanian\u2019s exit<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Reddit names YC\u2019s Michael Seibel to board, following co-founder Alexis Ohanian\u2019s exit&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/10\/reddit-names-ycs-michael-seibel-to-board-following-co-founder-alexis-ohanians-exit\/embed\/#?secret=VQP1KvIMd2\" data-secret=\"VQP1KvIMd2\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Reddit is gearing up to run ads for President Donald Trump ahead of the 2020 presidential election despite concerns from employees, TechCrunch has learned.

The hearing was the result of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, along with city attorneys from Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco, <a href=\"https:\/\/oag.ca.gov\/news\/press-releases\/attorney-general-becerra-and-city-attorneys-los-angeles-san-diego-and-san-0\">filing a preliminary injunction in an attempt to force Uber and Lyft to comply with AB 5 and immediately stop classifying their drivers as independent contractors.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Drivers do not want to be employees, full stop,&#8221; a <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/lyft\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"lyft\">Lyft <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;We\u2019ll immediately appeal this ruling and continue to fight for their independence. Ultimately, we believe this issue will be decided by California voters and that they will side with drivers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In the order, Judge Schulman says the plaintiffs are likely to prevail on the argument that Uber and Lyft are violating AB 5. AB 5 codifies the 2018 ruling established in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.courts.ca.gov\/opinions\/archive\/S222732.PDF\">Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v Superior Court of Los Angeles<\/a>. In that case, the court applied the ABC test and decided Dynamex wrongfully classified its workers as independent contractors based on the presumption that \u201ca worker who performs services for a hirer is an employee for purposes of claims for wages and benefits\u2026\u201d<\/p>\n<p>According to the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.courts.ca.gov\/opinions\/archive\/S222732.PDF\">ABC test<\/a>, in order for a hiring entity to legally classify a worker as an independent contractor, it must prove (A) the worker is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity, (B) performs work outside the scope of the entity\u2019s business and (C) is regularly engaged in an \u201cindependently established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as the work performed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The motion for a preliminary junction was filed as part of the suit filed in May, which<a href=\"https:\/\/oag.ca.gov\/system\/files\/attachments\/press-docs\/2020-05-05%20-%20Filed%20Complaint.pdf\">\u00a0asserted<\/a>\u00a0Uber and Lyft gain an unfair and unlawful competitive advantage by misclassifying workers as independent contractors. The suit argues\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/uber\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"uber\">Uber<\/a>\u00a0and Lyft are depriving workers of the right to minimum wage, overtime, access to paid sick leave, disability insurance and unemployment insurance. The lawsuit, filed in the Superior Court of San Francisco, seeks $2,500 in penalties for each violation, possibly per driver, under the California Unfair Competition Law, and another $2,500 for violations against senior citizens or people with disabilities.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;For years, workers have been organizing and speaking out against our mistreatment by billion-dollar gig companies who have refused to obey the law,&#8221; Uber driver and member of Gig Workers Rising Edan Alva said in a statement. &#8220;It is because of the fearlessness of workers that the Attorney General has been able to argue that the mistreatment we face is so severe that justice can no longer wait. Today, the court sided with workers and not corporations. Thousands of misclassified gig workers will receive the wages, benefits, protections and employee status they are legally owed. It is abundantly clear that Uber and Lyft now must comply with the law. We are steadfast in our demand that the gig companies drop their $110 million ballot initiative, Proposition 22, and reinvest those funds into treating their workers with dignity and respect.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>California Superior Court Judge Ethan Schulman has granted a preliminary injunction forcing Uber and Lyft to reclassify its drivers as employees.

to Human Capital (formerly known as Tech at Work), which looks at all things labor in tech. This week presented Uber and Lyft with a fresh labor lawsuit as a judge heard arguments from Uber, Lyft and lawyers on behalf of the people of California in a separate suit brought forth by California\u2019s attorney general. Meanwhile, Snap recently released its first-ever diversity and inclusion report &#8212; something the company had been holding off on doing for years.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Below, we&#8217;ll explore the nuances and the significance of these lawsuits, as well as Snap&#8217;s track record with diversity and inclusion. Let&#8217;s get to it.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Gig life<\/h2>\n<hr \/>\n<h3><b>CA Superior Court Judge Ethan P. Schulman heard arguments regarding a preliminary injunction that seeks to force Uber and Lyft to reclassify their drivers as employees<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>In May, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, along with city attorneys from Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco, sued <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/uber\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"uber\">Uber <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and Lyft, alleging the companies gain an unfair and unlawful competitive advantage by misclassifying workers as independent contractors. The suit argues <a href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/uber\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"uber\">Uber<\/a> and Lyft are depriving workers of the right to minimum wage, overtime, access to paid sick leave, disability insurance and unemployment insurance. In June, plaintiffs <a href=\"https:\/\/oag.ca.gov\/news\/press-releases\/attorney-general-becerra-and-city-attorneys-los-angeles-san-diego-and-san-0\">filed a preliminary injunction in an attempt to force Uber and Lyft to comply with AB 5 and immediately stop classifying their drivers as independent contractors.<\/a><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week, more than 100 people tuned in to the hearing regarding the preliminary injunction. The hearing, held on Zoom, initially was only able to hold just 100 people. But the interest in the case forced the court to increase its webinar capabilities to 500. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/06\/uber-lyft-preliminary-injunction-hearing\/\">There hasn\u2019t been a ruling yet<\/a>, but Judge Schulman said we could expect one likely within a matter of days, rather than weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the hearing, Schulman expressed how hard it is to determine the impact of a preliminary injunction in this case. For example, how Uber and Lyft would comply with the injunction is unknown, as are the economic effects on drivers, such as their ability to earn income, the hours they would be able to work and their eligibility for state benefits, Schulman said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI feel a little bit like I\u2019m being asked to jump into a body of water without really knowing how deep it is, how cold the water is and what\u2019s going to happen when I get in,&#8221; he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Here are some other key quotes from the hearing:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rohit Singla, counsel for <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/lyft\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"lyft\">Lyft<\/strong><\/p> <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>\n<blockquote><p>The proposed injunction would cause irreparable injury to Lyft and Uber, and would actually cause massive harm to drivers and harm to riders.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Matthew Goldberg, deputy city attorney for San Francisco<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We think the parties have drastically overstated precisely what they would need to do to be in compliance with the law.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3><b>The other lawsuits against Uber and Lyft<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier in the week, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/05\/uber-and-lyft-face-new-lawsuit-from-ca-labor-commissioner\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California Labor Commission sued Uber and Lyft in separate lawsuits<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The goals of the separate suits are to recover the money that is allegedly owed to these drivers. By classifying drivers as independent contractors rather than employees, both Uber and Lyft have not been required to pay minimum wage, overtime compensation, nor have they been required to offer paid breaks or reimburse drivers for the costs of driving.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What these lawsuits share is a core focus and argument that Uber and Lyft are misclassifying their drivers as independent contractors and breaking the law. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These two companies have been sued many, many times for their labor practices, specifically as they pertain to the classification of their respective drivers as independent contractors. What\u2019s different about the latest string of lawsuits is that they\u2019re coming in light of a new law that went into effect in California earlier this year that is supposed to make it harder for these gig economy companies to classify their workers this way. The lawsuits are also coming from legislative bodies, rather than from drivers themselves.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This moment has been a long time coming. Uber faced its first high-profile labor lawsuit back in 2013, when Douglas O\u2019Connor and Thomas Colopy sued Uber for classifying them as 1099 independent contractors. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/12\/uber-agrees-to-pay-drivers-20-million-to-settle-independent-contractor-lawsuit\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uber settled the lawsuit several years later in 2019 by paying out $20 million to O\u2019Connor and Colopy, as well as the other class members<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Stay Woke<\/h2>\n<hr \/>\n<h3><strong>Snap finally releases a diversity report<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Snap, after declining to release diversity numbers for years, finally decided now was the time to make them public. Before we jump in, let\u2019s take a quick look at Snap\u2019s history with diversity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>2016:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Snap came under fire for a couple of filters that many people called out as being racist. The first was a <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/tech\/2016\/04\/20\/snapchat-under-fire-blackface-filter\/83284206\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bob Marley filter that basically enabled some sort of digital blackface<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The second time it had to do with a lens that was supposed to be a take on anime characters. Instead, <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2016\/08\/10\/technology\/snapchat-racist-asian-filter\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">there was an outcry about Snapchat enabling yellowface<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>2017:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u201cWe fundamentally believe that having a team of diverse backgrounds and voices working together is our best shot at being able to create innovative products that improve the way people live and communicate. There are two things we focus on to achieve this goal. The first\u2014creating a diverse workplace\u2014helps us assemble this team. We convene at the conferences, host the hackathons, and invest in the institutions that bring us amazing diverse talent every year. The second\u2014creating an inclusive workplace\u2014is much harder to get right, but we believe it is required to unleash the potential of having a diverse team. That\u2019s because we believe diversity is about more than numbers. To us, it is really about creating a culture where everyone comes to work knowing that they have a seat at the table and will always be supported both personally and professionally. We started by challenging our management team to set this tone every day with each of their teams, and by investing in inclusion-focused programs ranging from community outreach to internal professional development. We still have a long and difficult road ahead in all of these efforts, but believe they represent one of our biggest opportunities to create a business that is not only successful but also one that we are proud to be a part of\u201d &#8211; <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/02\/02\/snap-diversity\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Snap\u2019s S-1<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><b>2018: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A former Snap engineer criticized the company for a \u201ctoxic\u201d and \u201csexist\u201d culture.

What does good email look like these days?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Generally speaking, a good email experience is not that different today than it was in 2004. It should be straightforward to use and should support the basic tasks like reading, writing, replying to and triaging emails. That said, nowadays there is a lot more email, in terms of volume, than there was in 2004, so we find that Gmail has many more opportunities to assist users in ways it didn\u2019t before. For example, tabbed inboxes, which sorts your email into helpful categories like Primary, Social, Promotions, etc. in a simple, organized way so you can focus on what\u2019s important to you. Also, we\u2019ve introduced assistive features like Smart Compose and Smart Reply and nudges, plus robust security and spam protection to keep users safe. And lastly, we\u2019ve made deeper integrations a priority: both across G Suite apps like Calendar, Keep, Tasks and most recently <a href=\"https:\/\/urldefense.com\/v3\/__https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/blog\/products\/g-suite\/introducing-your-new-home-for-work-in-gsuite__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!XxP4-pXdLy45LU9hKLmQtZT5lYuK9AyioYmN3NliMbP1Xw0QClCIVzbIR3h2LFg$\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/urldefense.com\/v3\/__https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/blog\/products\/g-suite\/introducing-your-new-home-for-work-in-gsuite__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!XxP4-pXdLy45LU9hKLmQtZT5lYuK9AyioYmN3NliMbP1Xw0QClCIVzbIR3h2LFg$&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1596245950727000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEvmzmwzmAVs827isyf6pFXrVGNYA\">Chat and Meet<\/a>, as well as with third-party services via the G Suite Marketplace.<span class=\"im\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How has Google\u2019s hypothesis about email evolved over the years?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We see email as a very strong communication channel and the primary means of digital communication for many of our users and customers for many years to come.

says Uber, Lyft preliminary injunction ruling to come in \u2018a matter of days\u2019"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">California Superior Court<\/span> Judge Ethan P. Schulman heard arguments from Uber and Lyft, as well as lawyers representing the people of California, regarding the request for a preliminary injunction that seeks <a href=\"https:\/\/oag.ca.gov\/news\/press-releases\/attorney-general-becerra-and-city-attorneys-los-angeles-san-diego-and-san-0\">to force Uber and Lyft to immediately reclassify their drivers as employees<\/a>. Schulman did not make a ruling today but said we could all likely expect one to come within a matter of days, rather than weeks.<\/p>\n<p>In the hearing, Schulman expressed how hard it is to determine the impact of a preliminary injunction in this case. For example, how <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/uber\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"uber\">Uber <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/lyft\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"lyft\">Lyft <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> would comply with the injunction is unknown, as are the economic effects on drivers, such as their ability to earn income, the hours they would be able to work and their eligibility for state benefits, Schulman said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I feel a little bit like I&#8217;m being asked to jump into a body of water without really knowing how deep it is, how cold the water is and what&#8217;s going to happen when I get in,&#8221; Schulman said.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Today&#8217;s hearing was the result of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, along with city attorneys from Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco, <a href=\"https:\/\/oag.ca.gov\/news\/press-releases\/attorney-general-becerra-and-city-attorneys-los-angeles-san-diego-and-san-0\">filing a preliminary injunction in an attempt to force Uber and Lyft to comply with AB 5 and immediately stop classifying their drivers as independent contractors.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The new law codifies the 2018 ruling established in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.courts.ca.gov\/opinions\/archive\/S222732.PDF\">Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v Superior Court of Los Angeles<\/a>. In that case, the court applied the ABC test (more on that a bit later) and decided Dynamex wrongfully classified its workers as independent contractors based on the presumption that \u201ca worker who performs services for a hirer is an employee for purposes of claims for wages and benefits\u2026\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In the hearing today, lawyers on behalf of the people of the state of California, and Uber and Lyft, discussed the classification of workers as independent contractors versus employees, gig worker protections bill AB 5, the definition of a &#8220;hiring entity,&#8221; unemployment benefits, paid sick leave, workers&#8217; compensation insurance and more.<\/p>\n<p>Uber and Lyft maintained that an injunction would require them to restructure their businesses in such a material way that it would prevent them from being able to employ many drivers on either a full-time or part-time basis. Uber and Lyft&#8217;s argument, effectively, is that classifying drivers as employees would result in job loss.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The proposed injunction would cause irreparable injury to Lyft and Uber, and would actually cause massive harm to drivers and harm to riders,&#8221; Rohit Singla, counsel for Lyft, said at the hearing. For example, Lyft estimates it would cost hundreds of millions of dollars simply to process the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.uscis.gov\/i-9#:~:text=Use%20Form%20I%2D9%20to,This%20includes%20citizens%20and%20noncitizens.\"> I-9 forms<\/a>, which verify employment eligibility. It doesn&#8217;t cost anything to file that form, but it would require Uber and Lyft to further invest in their human resources and payroll processes.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, Singla argued that a preliminary injunction at this stage of the case would be drastic. His argument resonated with the judge.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not every day that a judge is asked to issue an injunction on a preliminary basis, as he emphasizes, that could potentially affect hundreds of thousands of people. And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re dealing with here.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But the plaintiffs disagreed. That vast number of people affected is a key reason to issue the injunction, Matthew Goldberg, deputy San Francisco city attorney argued. Additionally, Goldberg argued it would be quite feasible for Uber and Lyft to reclassify its drivers.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very doable,&#8221; he said. &#8220;[&#8230;] Both of these businesses already have very large, white-collar workforces at their corporations. I can assure you that every one of those workers is getting workers&#8217; compensation insurance&#8221; and other benefits.<\/p>\n<p>He added, &#8220;extending this set of benefits to more workers, administratively, is not as difficult as they allege, given they already do this for thousands of workers.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, there are elements of Uber and Lyft-backed Prop 22 (details below) that are similar to what AB 5 requires, so plaintiffs argue there would not be irreparable harm for Uber and Lyft to comply with AB 5. Uber and Lyft, however, disagree.<\/p>\n<p>In Uber&#8217;s opening arguments, Uber counsel Theane Evangelis pointed to a number of product changes that should remove &#8220;any doubt about the compliance and demonstrate Uber is a technology platform&#8221; that operates a multi-sided marketplace she said. For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uber.com\/blog\/california\/set-your-fares\/\">Uber began allowing drivers in June to set their own prices<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Still, Judge Schulman pressed on Uber&#8217;s ability to satisfy Prong B of the ABC test. According to the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.courts.ca.gov\/opinions\/archive\/S222732.PDF\">ABC test<\/a>, in order for a hiring entity to legally classify a worker as an independent contractor, it must prove (A) the worker is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity, (B) performs work outside the scope of the entity\u2019s business and (C) is regularly engaged in an \u201cindependently established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as the work performed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If you look at Uber or Lyft, they&#8217;re not in the business of maintaining an online app by itself,&#8221; Schulman said. &#8220;That&#8217;s the technology by which they perform. Their business is providing rides to people for compensation. In plain English, that&#8217;s what they do? Isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Evangelis quickly replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; She argued that what Uber and Lyft do is simply connect drivers and riders through their technology platform. She also pointed to the variety of services Uber offers, such as Uber Eats and Freight. Evangelis went on to ask the judge if he would put this on pause until November, when Californians will vote on Prop 22, which is backed by Uber, Lyft and others.<\/p>\n<p>The ballot measure looks to implement an earnings guarantee of at least 120% of minimum wage while on the job, 30 cents per mile for expenses, a healthcare stipend, occupational accident insurance for on-the-job injuries, protection against discrimination and sexual harassment and automobile accident and liability insurance. Most notably, however, it would keep drivers classified as independent contractors.<\/p>\n<p>Judge Schulman, however, seemed flummoxed by the basis of the argument to wait until November to see what voters decide.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It seems to me that&#8217;s not my role,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And more significantly, it seems to me, if any of us learned anything from the 2016 election, is many of us are unable to predict the outcome of elections&#8230;I just wonder about the legitimacy of an argument like that.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Evangelis closed her time by saying that Uber believes it passes the ABC test today.<\/p>\n<p>The motion for a preliminary junction was filed as part of the suit filed in May, which<a href=\"https:\/\/oag.ca.gov\/system\/files\/attachments\/press-docs\/2020-05-05%20-%20Filed%20Complaint.pdf\"> asserted<\/a> Uber and Lyft gain an unfair and unlawful competitive advantage by misclassifying workers as independent contractors. The suit argues <a href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/uber\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"uber\">Uber<\/a> and Lyft are depriving workers of the right to minimum wage, overtime, access to paid sick leave, disability insurance and unemployment insurance. The lawsuit, filed in the Superior Court of San Francisco, seeks $2,500 in penalties for each violation, possibly per driver, under the California Unfair Competition Law, and another $2,500 for violations against senior citizens or people with disabilities.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dir.ca.gov\/DIRNews\/2020\/2020-65.html\">Uber and Lyft are both facing another lawsuit from the office of the California Labor Commissioner alleging wage theft<\/a>. Filed yesterday in Oakland, the suit similarly aims to enforce the labor practices set forth by AB 5.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>California Superior Court Judge Ethan P.

By classifying drivers as independent contractors rather than employees, both Uber and Lyft have not been required to pay minimum wage, overtime compensation, nor have they been required to offer paid breaks or reimburse drivers for the costs of driving.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>AB 5, which went into law earlier this year, outlines what type of worker can and cannot be classified as an independent contractor. The law codifies the ruling established in\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.courts.ca.gov\/opinions\/archive\/S222732.PDF\">Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v Superior Court of Los Angeles<\/a>. In that case, the court applied the ABC test and decided Dynamex wrongfully classified its workers as independent contractors.<\/p>\n<p>According to the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.courts.ca.gov\/opinions\/archive\/S222732.PDF\">ABC test<\/a>, in order for a hiring entity to legally classify a worker as an independent contractor, it must prove the worker is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity, performs work outside the scope of the entity\u2019s business and is regularly engaged in work of some independently established trade or other similar business.<\/p>\n<p>These suits are seeking for the court to order Uber and Lyft to classify their drivers as employees and provide them with all the protections that come with being a W-2 employee.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span id=\"m_3454833882775304930gmail-docs-internal-guid-ed2559f7-7fff-7bc3-087a-263d32bcaf0f\">&#8220;For years Uber and Lyft have been stealing wages and exploiting every legal loophole they can to avoid paying drivers what they deserve,&#8221; Transport Workers Union President John Samuelsen said in a statement. &#8220;It was shameful before and it is even more shameful now, during the middle of a pandemic, that we have allowed wealthy companies to get away with this. This lawsuit is an essential part of holding these companies accountable and protecting drivers\u2019 rights.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>These new lawsuits come just months before Californians are set to vote on Prop 22, a ballot measure backed by Uber, Lyft and others. The ballot measure looks to implement an earnings guarantee of at least 120% of minimum wage while on the job, 30 cents per mile for expenses, a healthcare stipend, occupational accident insurance for on-the-job injuries, protection against discrimination and sexual harassment and automobile accident and liability insurance. Most notably, however, it would keep drivers classified as independent contractors.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;[&#8230;]as this lawsuit clearly demonstrates, Sacramento politicians are more interested in the wishes of their special interest donors than the will of the vast majority of drivers and are intent on stripping drivers of the freedom to choose independent work,&#8221; the Yes on 22 campaign said in a statement. &#8220;This coordinated effort by all levels of government to run a politically motivated campaign will hurt the state at the worst possible time.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Uber and Lyft are both facing another lawsuit from the office of the California Labor Commissioner alleging wage theft.

Founders Matter, a fund focused on Black entrepreneurs, makes first investment"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Too often, Black founders are locked out of Silicon Valley before they even have a chance to get started, Marceau Michel, founder of venture capital firm <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blackfoundersmatter.org\/\">Black Founders Matter<\/a>, tells TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important we&#8217;re looking at the social justice movement from very different places,&#8221; Michel says. &#8220;It&#8217;s one thing for Black people to not be killed by the police &#8212; that&#8217;s just the baseline. We still have Black people locked out of economic opportunity.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why Michel has not given up on his mission to raise a $10 million fund to invest in Black entrepreneurs. Michel and I first chatted back in 2018, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/29\/black-founders-matter-wants-to-raise-10-million-to-fund-black-led-startups\/\">when he unveiled the fund<\/a>. Between then and now, Michel worked for a VC firm in Portland to better understand how the industry works. He also toyed with the idea of launching an incubator for Black entrepreneurs, instead of creating a fund. But what he landed on was that the tech industry needs more deciders, he says. So far, Black Founders Matter has raised about $1 million for the fund.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;We\u2019re not struggling to raise this fund now,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It\u2019s very tangible and very much in hand. The investors we\u2019re having conversations with understand the importance of the work we\u2019re doing investing in Black and diverse problem solvers make this society better.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>But it didn&#8217;t always feel like a feasible goal, Michel says. What makes it feel more achievable today is the heightened attention and conversations around racism in our society, he says.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Now, because it&#8217;s in the national conversation and in people&#8217;s minds, these resources are coming in quicker and the investors we&#8217;re talking to get what we&#8217;re trying to do,&#8221; he says. &#8220;You can do great work and you can also get profits. Those things are not mutually exclusive. We&#8217;ve had to turn investors down that were looking at Black Founders Matter as a charity.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Last month, Black Founders Matter made its first investment in a company called <a href=\"https:\/\/akidsbookabout.com\/\">A Kids Book About<\/a>, founded by Jelani Memory.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In a world where we look at how Black lives matter but also how we look at the quality of Black life in this country, it&#8217;s about creating access for the community to be able to solve problems,&#8221; Michel says.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s what the fund&#8217;s first investment did. A Kids Book About, which published its first book on the topic of racism in October, helps solve a problem for all communities, he says. Black Founders Matter only invested $40,000, but that figure is more of a reflection of how much space was left in the round. Michel says Memory carved out that space for Black Founders Matter by turning down other checks. Beyond this investment, there are a number of other companies on the firm&#8217;s radar, but first, it&#8217;s a matter of getting the funds to invest.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;This whole experience of raising this venture fund and working in this space was an exercise in being patient and not forcing it before it was its time,&#8221; Michel says. &#8220;And now, it\u2019s clearly time and the floodgates have opened. And we\u2019re able to do it with integrity and authenticity. I\u2019m not at a place where I need to convince people anymore. We&#8217;re able to have conversations with authority and not from a place of desperation. We\u2019re able to be selective about who invests in our fund. We can be selective and that is a very good sign of the future of Black entrepreneurship.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Too often, Black founders are locked out
