				<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/10/supporting-online-communities/">introducing</a> a suite of new features for Facebook Groups, the private social networking product now used by over 1.8 billion people every month. At the company&#8217;s digitally hosted Facebook Communities Summit today, Facebook detailed a set of upcoming tools aimed at those who run Groups, which are designed help them better organize, filter and manage their communities, as well as new features focused on sparking discussions &#8212; like chats, prompts and Q&amp;As. Notably, Facebook also said it would soon launch a test of a new feature that will highlight public group discussions to non-group members, including both on Facebook and off, via web searches.</p>
<p>The announcement comes at a time when Facebook Groups are making headlines for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-removed-6500-militia-groups-pages-002343444.html">their growing use</a> by those looking to spread harmful content and misinformation. Facebook this week said it removed over 6,500 militia groups and pages just last month alone, for example. Facebook Groups have also become the breeding grounds for a wide range of dangerous content, including health misinformation, anti-science movements, and<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/08/01/qanon-trump-florida-rally-what-q-signs-mean/878642002/"> baseless conspiracy theories that brainwash users</a> into thinking there are secret signals hidden on the internet offering insight into an alternate reality that only they can see.</p>
<p>The new feature set for the Facebook Groups product itself, announced today, aren&#8217;t necessarily focused solving these sorts of issues, however. Instead, they&#8217;re largely about making Groups easier to manage and use, in a more general sense. But the forthcoming test of where group discussions can be found may have a broader impact.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To start, a new &#8220;Admin Assist&#8221; tool will help Facebook Group administrators better moderate posts by automatically declining posts that use certain keywords.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2054988" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2054988" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2054988" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Admin-Assist-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="406" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Admin-Assist-1.png 3352w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Admin-Assist-1.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Admin-Assist-1.png?resize=300,179 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Admin-Assist-1.png?resize=768,459 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Admin-Assist-1.png?resize=680,406 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Admin-Assist-1.png?resize=1536,917 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Admin-Assist-1.png?resize=2048,1223 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Admin-Assist-1.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2054988" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>This could be used to filter out certain inappropriate content, like foul language, but it could also be used to stop the approval of posts that were off-topic, those used words or hashtags associated with dangerous movements, like QAnon, or even just those posts that were attempting to advertise by way of Facebook Groups.<br />
For example, many communities have policies banning posts from multi-level marketing firms (MLMs) &#8212; like Amway, Herbalife, Young Living, doTERRA, Avon and others&#8211; but without switching on post approval for all posts or users, there was no other way to block these attempted ads in an automated way before now.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2054987" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2054987" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2054987" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Admin-Assist-2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="406" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Admin-Assist-2.png 3352w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Admin-Assist-2.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Admin-Assist-2.png?resize=300,179 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Admin-Assist-2.png?resize=768,459 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Admin-Assist-2.png?resize=680,406 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Admin-Assist-2.png?resize=1536,917 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Admin-Assist-2.png?resize=2048,1223 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Admin-Assist-2.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2054987" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Group admins will also be able to organize content from their community by hashtag, then pin a topic to the top of the Group to highlight it for everyone.</p>
<p>This could be helpful for tracking popular topics that get regularly discussed on the group, perhaps. It could also be used to save people from asking the same questions over and over by pointing them to places where the answers were already provided, among other things.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2055187" style="width: 340px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2055187" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2055187" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/unnamed-2.png?w=330" alt="" width="330" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/unnamed-2.png 848w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/unnamed-2.png?resize=73,150 73w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/unnamed-2.png?resize=146,300 146w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/unnamed-2.png?resize=768,1583 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/unnamed-2.png?resize=330,680 330w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/unnamed-2.png?resize=745,1536 745w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/unnamed-2.png?resize=24,50 24w" sizes="(max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2055187" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Facebook Group admins will also be able to use the Brand Collabs Manager which will allow them to monetize a larger, public groups by working directly with brands who want to promote their products and services to the group&#8217;s users.</p>
<p>Before today, brands tended to collaborate with influential individuals who had a following, but now they could associate themselves with an influential group instead.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2054985" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2054985" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2054985" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brand-Collabs-Manager-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="414" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brand-Collabs-Manager-1.png 4136w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brand-Collabs-Manager-1.png?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brand-Collabs-Manager-1.png?resize=300,182 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brand-Collabs-Manager-1.png?resize=768,467 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brand-Collabs-Manager-1.png?resize=680,414 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brand-Collabs-Manager-1.png?resize=1536,934 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brand-Collabs-Manager-1.png?resize=2048,1246 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brand-Collabs-Manager-1.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2054985" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Finally, Facebook will introduce a curriculum and exam that will allow people to achieve a certification in Community Management that indicates they understand how to build, grow and support a Facebook Group community.</p>
<p>Other changes arriving in Groups are aimed at better engaging users.</p>
<p>One new feature will allow Groups to feature real-time chats for conversations with other Group users.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2054995" style="width: 341px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2054995" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2054995" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Chats-1.png?w=331" alt="" width="331" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Chats-1.png 850w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Chats-1.png?resize=73,150 73w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Chats-1.png?resize=146,300 146w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Chats-1.png?resize=768,1579 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Chats-1.png?resize=331,680 331w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Chats-1.png?resize=747,1536 747w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Chats-1.png?resize=24,50 24w" sizes="(max-width: 331px) 100vw, 331px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2054995" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>A new collaborative post type, &#8220;Prompts,&#8221; will encourage conversations through the use of photos. This capitalizes on a trend already taking place across groups, where an admin will prompt discussion by asking users to share a photo &#8212; for instance, a favorite meme, a picture of their pet, a selfie, their last photo in their Camera Roll, and so on.</p>
<p>But the new format will turn this activity into a product, allowing users to more easily contribute their response, then flip through the images shared by others.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2054994" style="width: 341px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2054994" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2054994" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Prompts-1.png?w=331" alt="" width="331" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Prompts-1.png 850w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Prompts-1.png?resize=73,150 73w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Prompts-1.png?resize=146,300 146w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Prompts-1.png?resize=768,1579 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Prompts-1.png?resize=331,680 331w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Prompts-1.png?resize=747,1536 747w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Prompts-1.png?resize=24,50 24w" sizes="(max-width: 331px) 100vw, 331px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2054994" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Similarly, admins will be able to encourage discussions through new Q&amp;A sessions which are easier for community members to participate in by not relying on the traditional threaded comment format.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2054997" style="width: 341px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2054997" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2054997" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/QAs-1.png?w=331" alt="" width="331" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/QAs-1.png 850w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/QAs-1.png?resize=73,150 73w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/QAs-1.png?resize=146,300 146w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/QAs-1.png?resize=768,1579 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/QAs-1.png?resize=331,680 331w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/QAs-1.png?resize=747,1536 747w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/QAs-1.png?resize=24,50 24w" sizes="(max-width: 331px) 100vw, 331px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2054997" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Group members can also choose to customize their profile photo for each group they participate in. This could help users feel more comfortable when contributing to a larger, public community, for example, or it could be just used for fun &#8212; like using a photo of your dog in a pet community or your favorite book in your online book club, for example.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2054991" style="width: 340px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2054991" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2054991" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Customize-Your-Profile-2.png?w=330" alt="" width="330" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Customize-Your-Profile-2.png 848w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Customize-Your-Profile-2.png?resize=73,150 73w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Customize-Your-Profile-2.png?resize=146,300 146w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Customize-Your-Profile-2.png?resize=768,1583 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Customize-Your-Profile-2.png?resize=330,680 330w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Customize-Your-Profile-2.png?resize=745,1536 745w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Customize-Your-Profile-2.png?resize=24,50 24w" sizes="(max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2054991" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Related to these changes, Facebook also says it will begin to test new ways for people to discover conversations happening on Public groups.</p>
<p>This will be done by showing something called &#8220;Related Discussions&#8221; within the News Feed when someone posts a link or reshares a post on Facebook. These discussions will allow users to see what other, Public groups are saying about the same content. In a more radical change, Facebook says these discussions will also be indexed by search engines as users may see these conversations appear when &#8220;you&#8217;re searching the web.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2054981" style="width: 340px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2054981" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2054981" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Related-Discussions-1.png?w=330" alt="" width="330" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Related-Discussions-1.png 848w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Related-Discussions-1.png?resize=73,150 73w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Related-Discussions-1.png?resize=145,300 145w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Related-Discussions-1.png?resize=768,1585 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Related-Discussions-1.png?resize=330,680 330w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Related-Discussions-1.png?resize=744,1536 744w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Related-Discussions-1.png?resize=24,50 24w" sizes="(max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2054981" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Facebook notes that it may use this feature to open up users to more &#8220;diverse perspectives on the topics they&#8217;re into&#8221; from others with &#8220;different backgrounds and experiences.&#8221; That seems to imply the change is an attempt to de-isolate users from the Facebook bubbles they&#8217;ve built for themselves.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s unclear how far Facebook will go on this front, as the feature is not yet live. It&#8217;s also not clear how users will react to be shown to opposing content &#8212; like if posts about the &#8220;big team&#8221; also included related discussions from the other team&#8217;s fan group. And if this feature was leveraged for more controversial discussions, like politics, it could get even worse.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2054982" style="width: 340px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2054982" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2054982" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Related-Discussions-2.png?w=330" alt="" width="330" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Related-Discussions-2.png 848w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Related-Discussions-2.png?resize=73,150 73w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Related-Discussions-2.png?resize=145,300 145w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Related-Discussions-2.png?resize=768,1585 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Related-Discussions-2.png?resize=330,680 330w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Related-Discussions-2.png?resize=744,1536 744w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Related-Discussions-2.png?resize=24,50 24w" sizes="(max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2054982" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, Facebook will invite users to join in the conversation at hand, if the Group allows outside participation.</p>
<p>Facebook says the feature will be tested in the U.S. in the &#8220;coming months&#8221; and admins will be offered the option to allow their groups to be included in the new Public groups experience at that time, where they&#8217;ll be able to turn on post-approvals. The feature will expand outside the U.S. next year.</p>
<p>The company adds that anything rated false by third-party checkers won&#8217;t be eligible to be surfaced in Related Discussions or the other features where posts are surfaced to people. And Facebook says that if something breaks its rules, it will be taken down completely. Of course, these guidelines exist today on Facebook and yet misinformation continues to spread and remains un-fact checked across the platform. This is because the issue is that enforcing guidelines at Facebook&#8217;s scale is exceedingly difficult, especially since the entire business has been built around a revenue model that prioritizes advertising but outsources moderation.</p>
<p>The other features announced today will also begin rolling out in the months ahead.</p>

target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"facebook\">Facebook <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> today says <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2020\/10\/taking-legal-action-against-data-scraping\/\">it has filed a lawsuit<\/a> in the U.S. against two companies that had engaged in an international &#8220;data scraping&#8221; operation. The operation extended across Facebook properties, including both Facebook and Instagram, as well as other large websites and services, including Twitter, Amazon, LinkedIn and YouTube. The companies, who gathered the data of Facebook users for &#8220;marketing intelligence&#8221; purposes, did so in violation of Facebook&#8217;s Terms of Service, says Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>The businesses named in the lawsuits are Israeli-based BrandTotal Ltd. and Unimania Inc., a business incorporated in Delaware.<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brandtotal.com\/\">BrandTotal&#8217;s<\/a> website, its company offers a real-time competitive intelligence platform that&#8217;s designed to give media, insights and analytics teams visibility into their competition&#8217;s social media strategy and paid campaigns. These insights would allow its customers to analyze and shift their budget allocation to target new opportunities, monitor trends and threats from emerging brands, optimize their ads and messaging, and more.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Meanwhile, Unimania operated apps claimed to offer users the ability to access social networks in different ways. For example, Unimania offered apps that let you view Facebook via a mobile-web interface or alongside other social networks like Twitter. Another app let you view Instagram Stories anonymously, it claimed.<\/p>\n<p>However, Facebook&#8217;s lawsuit is largely focused on two browser extensions offered by the companies: Unimania&#8217;s<a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/ads-feed\/deciloopcooglpjhomblbbjeeenohbpg?hl=en\">\u00a0&#8220;Ads Feed<\/a>&#8221; and BrandTotal&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/upvoice\/bmngkajcejghcgafbobemkpjboikmgfi?hl=en\">UpVoice<\/a>.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The former allowed users to save the ads they saw on Facebook for later reference. But as the extension&#8217;s page discloses, doing so would opt users into a panel that informed the advertising decisions of Unimania&#8217;s corporate customers. UpVote, on the other hand, rewarded users with gift cards for using top social networking and shopping sites and sharing their opinions about the online campaigns run by big brands.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook says these extensions operated in violation of its protections against scraping and its terms of service. When users installed the extensions and visited Facebook websites, the extensions installed automated programs to scrape their name, user ID, gender, date of birth, relationship status, location information, and other information related to their accounts. The data was then sent to a server shared by BrandTotal and Unimania.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; display: block;\"><a style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" title=\"View Facebook lawsuit vs BrandTotal Ltd. and Unimania Inc. on Scribd\" href=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/document\/478333898\/Facebook-lawsuit-vs-BrandTotal-Ltd-and-Unimania-Inc#from_embed\">Facebook lawsuit vs BrandTotal Ltd. and Unimania Inc.<\/a> by <a style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" title=\"View TechCrunch's profile on Scribd\" href=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/publisher\/17551504\/TechCrunch#from_embed\">TechCrunch<\/a> on Scribd<\/p>\n<p><iframe id=\"doc_36050\" class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" title=\"Facebook lawsuit vs BrandTotal Ltd. and Unimania Inc.\" src=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/embeds\/478333898\/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;access_key=key-WF2ETdCfBtOhKRJqsiDN\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" data-auto-height=\"false\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.75\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Data scrapers exist in part to collect as much information as they can through any means possible using automated tools, like bots and scripts. Cambridge Analytica infamously <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/22\/facebook-staff-raised-concerns-about-cambridge-analytica-in-september-2015-per-court-filing\/\">scraped millions of Facebook profiles<\/a> in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election in order to target undecided voters. Other data scraping operations use bots to monitor concert or event ticket prices in order to undercut competitors. Scraped data can also be used for marketing and advertising, or simply sold on to others.<\/p>\n<p>In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook has begun to pursue legal action against various developers that break its terms of service.<\/p>\n<p>Most cases involving data scraping are litigated under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, written in the 1980s to prosecute computer hacking cases. Anyone who <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eff.org\/deeplinks\/2019\/09\/victory-ruling-hiq-v-linkedin-protects-scraping-public-data\">accesses a computer &#8220;without authorization&#8221;<\/a> can face hefty fines or even prison time.<\/p>\n<p>But because the law doesn&#8217;t specifically define what &#8220;authorized&#8221; access is and what isn&#8217;t, tech giants have seen mixed results in their efforts to shut down data scrapers.<\/p>\n<p>LinkedIn <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en\/article\/9kek83\/linkedin-data-scraping-lawsuit-shot-down\">lost<\/a> its high-profile case against HiQ Labs in 2019 after an appeals court ruled that the scraper was only collecting data that was publicly available from the internet. Internet rights groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eff.org\/deeplinks\/2019\/09\/victory-ruling-hiq-v-linkedin-protects-scraping-public-data\">lauded the decision<\/a>, arguing that internet users should not face legal threats &#8220;simply for accessing publicly available information in a way that publishers object to.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Facebook&#8217;s latest legal case is slightly different because the company is accusing BrandTotal of scraping Facebook profile data that wasn&#8217;t inherently public. Facebook says the accused data scraper used a browser extension installed on users&#8217; computers to gain access to their Facebook profile data.<\/p>\n<p>In March 2019, it took action against two Ukrainian developers who were harvesting data using quiz apps and browser extensions to scrape profile information and people\u2019s friends lists, Facebook says. A court in California recently <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Browser-Extension-Case.pdf\">recommended<\/a> a judgement in Facebook&#8217;s favor in the case. A separate <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/STACKLA.pdf\">case<\/a> around scraping filed last year against a marketing partner Stackla\u00a0 also came back in Facebook&#8217;s favor.<\/p>\n<p>This year, Facebook <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2020\/08\/taking-legal-action-against-those-who-abuse-our-platform\/\">filed lawsuits<\/a> against <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/27\/facebook-sues-developers-who-violated-terms-to-collect-user-data-sell-fake-likes\/\">companies<\/a> and individuals engaged in both scraping and fake engagement services.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook isn&#8217;t just cracking down on data scraping businesses to protect user privacy, however. It&#8217;s because failing to do so can lead to large fines. Facebook at the beginning of this year was <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/29\/facebook-will-pay-550-million-to-settle-class-action-lawsuit-over-privacy-violations\/\">ordered<\/a> to pay out over half a billion dollars to settle a class action lawsuit that alleged systemic violation of an Illinois privacy law. Last year, it <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/24\/facebook-settles-with-ftc-5-billion-and-new-privacy-guarantees\/\">settled with the FTC over privacy lapses<\/a> and had to pay a $5 billion penalty. As governments work to further regulation online privacy and data violations, fines like this could add up.<\/p>\n<p>The company says legal action isn&#8217;t the only way it&#8217;s working to stop data scraping. It has also invested in technical teams and tools to monitor and detect suspicious activity and the use of of unauthorized automation for scraping, it says.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Facebook today says it has filed a lawsuit in the U.S. against two companies that had engaged in an international &#8220;data scraping&#8221; operation.

Earlier this year, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/28\/trump-twitter-executive-order-social-media\/\">Trump lashed out at Twitter<\/a> for moderating his false claims with an executive order threatening the law. While the order was largely toothless, Trump&#8217;s focus on Section 230 set the agenda for the Barr&#8217;s Department of Justice and for Republicans in Congress eager to follow his lead.

London, and is also the UK Treasury's Special Envoy for Fintech.\t<\/div>\n\t\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">In case you<\/span> missed it: On Monday, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong wrote a company blog post titled &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.coinbase.com\/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804\">Coinbase is a mission focused company<\/a>&#8221; which drew both praise and critique that has continued throughout the week. Personally, I wasn\u2019t terribly impressed.<\/p>\n<p>I limited my reaction on Twitter to one retweet, a couple of replies and some likes. But on Tuesday, a journalist asked if I had any comment to contribute to a piece she\u2019s writing on the matter, so I tried to articulate a comment in one or two lines. The next thousand-ish words is what I ended up with.<\/p>\n<p>This is such a sensitive, nuanced and personal topic, and I wouldn\u2019t want to be irresponsible by making a quick off-handed remark or not taking enough into consideration.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>However, I think it\u2019s so important, it\u2019d be irresponsible <strong>not <\/strong>to say something when asked.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d like to think I understood the intent \u2014 that Brian wants to ensure that <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/coinbase\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"coinbase\">Coinbase <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> is inclusive of people who hold different views than what\u2019s assumed to be progressive in the tech sector (or elsewhere) and avoid creating a workplace that is divided and too &#8220;distracted&#8221; (his word) by political causes or social activism.<\/p>\n<p>However, what he\u2019s really only done is highlight his tremendous position of privilege. Privilege doesn\u2019t mean that he hasn\u2019t struggled or hasn\u2019t worked hard at being CEO of his company or in life. It simply means he thinks social activism can be a \u201cdistraction.&#8221; It means he thinks it\u2019s a distraction to think about human rights and whether what\u2019s happening around us is just or not.<\/p>\n<p>It means he doesn&#8217;t wake up worrying about how institutional racism or systemic oppression might affect him. It means he doesn\u2019t relate to the feeling that he could be the next driver to be unjustifiably stopped and searched, asked to get out of his car (or worse) for a broken taillight or verbally ridiculed or assaulted for someone else\u2019s assumptions about his sexual orientation. It means he doesn\u2019t think the rise of white supremacy in America is going to affect or diminish his ability to \u201cstay focused\u201d on his company\u2019s mission. It means he doesn\u2019t have to go to work wondering if he\u2019ll be pushed aside, undermined or spoken over by a male colleague.<\/p>\n<p>Brian\u2019s statement made me think back to conversations I had with some friends over the summer who said they weren\u2019t going to watch \u201cevery single video\u201d of police brutality in the U.S. relating to the Black Lives Matter protests. It\u2019s possible that I was watching too much because it was only increasing my frustration and feelings of powerlessness to help or change things, but I also realized that my friends admitting that they\u2019d stopped watching each new video was a luxury and a privilege for them.<\/p>\n<p>They didn\u2019t have to watch them \u2014 no one is required to \u2014 but they were able to switch off because the injustice and inequity of it all doesn\u2019t burn in their minds. It doesn\u2019t affect them personally. It doesn\u2019t impact how they walk down the street or conduct themselves around law enforcement. They have the privilege of not ever imagining or worrying if the victims of police brutality happened to be their family or close friends or even people they might know.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/brian-armstrong\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"brian-armstrong\">Brian Armstrong\u2019s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> call to not engage in political discourse via his platform and his position as a leader is a privilege whilst others are compelled out of concern and fear to speak up for themselves, others, and those who have softer or even no voices.<\/p>\n<p>In the memo, he takes time to reiterate the fact that the company will \u201cfocus on the things that help us achieve our mission,\u201d including sourcing job candidates from underrepresented backgrounds, reducing unconscious bias and fostering an environment where everyone is welcome regardless of background, sexual orientation, race, gender, age, etc. While I\u2018m glad to see him recognize these areas of focus, immediately after that section he goes on to say that <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/coinbase\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"coinbase\">Coinbase <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> won\u2019t engage on \u201cbroader societal issues\u201d or advocacy for political causes. From where does he think the first set of principles emerged?!?<\/p>\n<p>It seems outlandish to have to establish this, but it wasn\u2019t always the case that sexual orientation, race, gender or age were awarded equal treatment in employment law. It was in my lifetime that women could be fired from work for being pregnant. It is precisely engaging in \u201cbroader societal issues\u201d that brought about those points of legal fairness and equality \u2014 and those are incredibly vulnerable right now. How dare he say he\u2019s willing to embrace and stand for what\u2019s been established so far, but that there\u2019s no reason to engage any further? What that tells me is that as far as he\u2019s concerned, the debates and activism to date have achieved enough and the rest, now, is distraction.<\/p>\n<p>That. Is. Privilege.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously, I know Coinbase is Brian\u2019s company, and therefore it\u2019s fully his prerogative to lay out the \u201cmission\u201d and rules as he sees fit. But what bothers me is that he and others who are feeling emboldened to say they agree or even commend him for \u201cbeing brave\u201d enough for saying so won\u2019t realize the extent of their privilege and may inadvertently walk back so much recent progress and positive dialogue in the tech sector and business more broadly. We\u2019ve seen so much evidence in recent years that consumers and purchasing power gravitate toward brands and companies that articulate what they stand for.<\/p>\n<p>No longer is it enough for brands to be likable or just upbeat. Their silence on social injustices is deafening. Their association with individuals who either contribute to or enable racism or oppression of people and groups is enough for customers to think twice about using them. Their public support of activism and human rights either in merchandise or TV advertisements drives up their stock price. As more and more products and services are increasingly commoditized, consumers have sought to align themselves with brands and products that reflect their ethos.<\/p>\n<p>It was a free pass for too long for businesses and their leaders to say that they didn\u2019t wade into politics. In recent years, for example, because of the U.K.-EU Brexit referendum, the 2016 U.S. presidential election, or other occasions, companies and brand values have been drawn out and exposed for good or bad. It would be a shame for consumers and all stakeholders to lose that trend.<\/p>\n<p>I hope that investor shareholders and employees of companies where leaders might be asserting similar views of not wanting to get \u201cdistracted\u201d by social action will help to demonstrate just how much impact can be achieved by dialogue and action.<\/p>\n<p>People do their best work and form championship

In spite of that, Oracle founder and chief technology officer Larry Ellison gushed in<a href=\"https:\/\/www.oracle.com\/news\/announcement\/oracle-chosen-as-tiktok-secure-cloud-provider-091920.html\"> a September 19 press release<\/a> about how TikTok had &#8220;chosen&#8221; his company&#8217;s cloud infrastructure service. The statement also indicated that this &#8220;choice&#8221; was influenced by Zoom&#8217;s decision to move <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/28\/in-surprise-choice-zoom-hitches-wagon-to-oracle-for-growing-infrastructure-needs\/\">some percentage of its workloads<\/a> to Oracle&#8217;s infrastructure cloud earlier this year.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"qc4TYorQD1\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/28\/in-surprise-choice-zoom-hitches-wagon-to-oracle-for-growing-infrastructure-needs\/\">In surprise choice, Zoom partners with Oracle for growing infrastructure needs<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;In surprise choice, Zoom partners with Oracle for growing infrastructure needs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/28\/in-surprise-choice-zoom-hitches-wagon-to-oracle-for-growing-infrastructure-needs\/embed\/#?secret=qc4TYorQD1\" data-secret=\"qc4TYorQD1\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The mechanics of the TikTok deal aside, the question is how big an effect will these two customers have on the company&#8217;s overall cloud infrastructure market share. We asked a couple of firms who closely watch all things cloud.<\/p>\n<p>John Dinsdale, chief analyst at Synergy Research Group, wasn&#8217;t terribly optimistic that they would have much material impact on moving the market share needle for the database giant. &#8220;<a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/oracle\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"oracle\">Oracle\u2019s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> cloud infrastructure services growth has been consistently below overall IaaS and PaaS market growth rates so its market share has [actually] been nudging downward. Zoom may be a good win but it is unlikely to move the needle too much &#8212; and remember <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/zoom-video-communications\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"zoom-video-communications\">Zoom <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> also buys cloud services from AWS,&#8221; Dinsdale told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>As for TikTok, Dinsdale, like the rest of us, wasn&#8217;t clear how that deal would ultimately play out, but he says even with both companies in the fold, it wasn&#8217;t going to shift market share as much as Oracle might hope. &#8220;Hypothetically, even if Zoom\/TikTok helped Oracle increase its cloud infrastructure service revenues 50% over 12 months, which would be a real stretch, its market share would still be nearer to 2% than 3%. This compares with Google at 9%, Microsoft 18% and AWS 33%,&#8221; Dinsdale said.<\/p>\n<p>He did point out that the company&#8217;s SaaS business is much stronger. &#8220;Broadening the scope a little to other cloud services, Oracle\u2019s SaaS growth is running roughly in line with overall market SaaS market growth so market share is steady. Oracle\u2019s share of the total enterprise SaaS market is running at around 6%, though if you drill down to the ERP segment it is obviously doing much better than that,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Canalys, another firm that follows the cloud infrastructure market says their numbers tell a similar story for Oracle. While it&#8217;s doing well in Saas with 7.8% market share, it&#8217;s struggling in IaaS\/PaaS.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;For IaaS\/PaaS, Oracle Cloud is at 1.9% for Q2 2020 and that isn\u2019t moving much. The top three providers are AWS, Azure and Google Cloud, who have 30.8%, 20.2% and 6.2% respectively,&#8221; Blake Murray from Canalys told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth keeping in mind that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/11\/19\/google-buys-bebop-and-names-diane-greene-to-lead-enterprise-cloud-effort\/\">Google hired Diane Greene five years ago<\/a> with the hope of accelerating its cloud infrastructure business. Former Oracle exec <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/11\/16\/former-oracle-exec-thomas-kurian-to-replace-diane-greene-as-head-of-google-cloud\/\">Thomas Kurian replaced her<\/a> two years ago and the company&#8217;s market share still hasn&#8217;t reached double digits in spite of a period of big overall market growth, showing how much of a challenge it is to move the needle in a significant way.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"pHwQ9DHXZP\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/12\/google-and-ibm-still-trying-desperately-to-move-cloud-market-share-needle\/\">Google and IBM still trying desperately to move cloud market-share needle<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Google and IBM still trying desperately to move cloud market-share needle&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/12\/google-and-ibm-still-trying-desperately-to-move-cloud-market-share-needle\/embed\/#?secret=pHwQ9DHXZP\" data-secret=\"pHwQ9DHXZP\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Another big company,<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/10\/29\/assessing-ibms-34-billion-red-hat-acquisition\/\"> IBM bought Red Hat<\/a> two years ago for $34 billion with an eye toward improving its cloud business, and while Red Hat has continued to do well, it does not seem to have much impact on the company&#8217;s overall cloud infrastructure market share, which has been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/14\/alibaba-cloud-revenue-reaches-1-5b-for-the-quarter-on-62-growth-rate\/\">superseded by Alibaba<\/a> in fourth place, according to Synergy&#8217;s numbers.

<a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2020\/10\/supporting-online-communities\/\">introducing<\/a> a suite of new features for Facebook Groups, the private social networking product now used by over 1.8 billion people every month. At the company&#8217;s digitally hosted Facebook Communities Summit today, Facebook detailed a set of upcoming tools aimed at those who run Groups, which are designed help them better organize, filter and manage their communities, as well as new features focused on sparking discussions &#8212; like chats, prompts and Q&amp;As. Notably, Facebook also said it would soon launch a test of a new feature that will highlight public group discussions to non-group members, including both on Facebook and off, via web searches.<\/p>\n<p>The announcement comes at a time when Facebook Groups are making headlines for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/facebook-removed-6500-militia-groups-pages-002343444.html\">their growing use<\/a> by those looking to spread harmful content and misinformation. Facebook this week said it removed over 6,500 militia groups and pages just last month alone, for example. Facebook Groups have also become the breeding grounds for a wide range of dangerous content, including health misinformation, anti-science movements, and<a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/nation-now\/2018\/08\/01\/qanon-trump-florida-rally-what-q-signs-mean\/878642002\/\"> baseless conspiracy theories that brainwash users<\/a> into thinking there are secret signals hidden on the internet offering insight into an alternate reality that only they can see.<\/p>\n<p>The new feature set for the Facebook Groups product itself, announced today, aren&#8217;t necessarily focused solving these sorts of issues, however.
