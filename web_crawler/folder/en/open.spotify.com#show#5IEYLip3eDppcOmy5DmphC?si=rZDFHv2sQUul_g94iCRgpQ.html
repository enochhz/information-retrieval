As a programming note, I am off next week effectively, so look for Natasha to lead on Equity Monday and the both her and Danny to rock the Thursday show. I will miss everyone.But onto the show itself, here's what we got into:Zoom's earliest investors are betting millions on a better Zoom for schools: Built on Natasha's reporting, we took a look at a neat company that wants to make Zoom better for the educational environments where it had suddenly taken the center stage. Teachers need more.The first rule of BookClub? No boring book clubs. Another Natasha story this week, this time about a startup that we somewhat like but can't decide how its market will be. Still, the biblophiles in your life should read this piece and get hype about rising access to authors.Robinhood raised $460 million more, extending its preceding $200 million Series G to a $660 million total investment. Chime also added $485 million at a new, $14.5 billion valuation. We dug into what's up with the pair and why they are raising so much money.The short answer is hella growth, leading us to a question and this week's headline: Why isn't Robinhood a verb yet?Willow, the startup making the wearable breast pump, raises $55 million: Natasha talked us through some of the issues with the phrase femtech, before Danny explained to us the need for what Willow offers. Here's to more tech being used to help more folks at more stages of life.Then we turned to VC media, namely our notes on a new venture capital gameshow, and, a16z launching a podcast network. We also worked what Casey Newton is up to into the same conversation.Bon voyage for a week, please stay safe and don't forget to register to vote.

So, this is what we got up to:US tech stocks are poised to sell off further this morning.The Oracle-TikTok-Walmart-ByteDance deal is either coming into focus, or a period of even less clarity. It's hard to tell.Nikola founder Trevor Milton is leaving the board of his own company in the wake of fraud allegations. Shares of the company are sharply lower in pre-market trading.Turning to TikTok, this primer represents the best over-the-weekend roundup that we could find. But, of course, things are still breaking as we come to print.Since recording, Oracle has said that \"upon creation of TikTok Global, Oracle\/Walmart will make their investment and the TikTok Global shares will be distributed to their owners, Americans will be the majority and ByteDance will have no ownership in TikTok Global.\" And, President Trump said this morning that China has to give up control of TikTok or the deal is off. ByteDance has said that it will retain control. You figure that out.But there was some good stuff to chat about. Including the super-neat Mobile Premier League round worth $90 million, growth news from EU-based Babbel, a new London-based Seed fund that got raised, and a Swedish healthtech Series B.As you guessed from today's title, it was fun to see such a concentration of EU VC activity.Finally, will the Nikola mess discourage more SPACs from taking companies public? If the rest of the stock market wasn't selling off, we would have said no. But today? Is the answer maybe?

It was good fun, though of course we're looking forward to bringing the live show back to the conference next year, vaccine allowing.Thankfully we had Chris Gates behind the scenes tweaking the dials, Alexandra Ames fitting us into the program, and some folks to watch live.What did we talk about? All of this (and some very, very bad jokes):The Great American SPAC-Off: As both Opendoor and Desktop Metal approach the public markets on the wings of SPACs, we ask why. And why we have to keep talking about SPACs, which we do not want to do.But the public markets are hot and active, with companies like JFrog and Snowflake going public to great effect. JFrog had a great IPO. Snowflake had an insane IPO.But there was a lot of action from the private markets as well, including Airtable raising $185 million, ApplyBoard raised a $55 million extension, and Tonal raised $110 million, because connected fitness is hotter than SaaS at the moment.We also riffed on Natasha's venture trends' piece, digging into how to get to conviction in a remote-only world. As it turns out, we have notes on video games.And there were two new funds, including one from the Chainsmokers (hot, fun, great) and another from Greylock (traditional, Victorian, and huge). In more serious commentary, the Greylock raise continues the mega-fund era.And then we tried to play a game that may or may not make it into the final cut. Either way, it was great to have Equity back at Disrupt. More to come.

Disrupt kicks off today, so the TechCrunch crew is busy as heck getting all the final touches put on. Snag a ticket here and we will see you soon.On the podcast this morning:Stocks are set to open sharply higher as we hit record, a good and welcome comeback for investors in both private and public tech companies.The NVIDIA-ARM deal is finally a go, so we can put the entire saga to rest at last.All things TikTok: Microsoft losing the deal, Oracle possibly winning the deal, the Chinese government saying no to the whole affair, and the Chinese government only saying no to part of the deal? What is clear is that the deal is under pressure to happen and not to happen. We'll know more soon.Descartes Underwriting raised $18.5 million for its insurtech solution, while Xometry raised $75 million in a Series E for offshore manufacturing in factories with spare capacity.GoJek and Grab may merge.And, finally, the CBP is a huge mess and an embarrassment.Ok, that's all we have time for today.

This week was a real team effort as we are heading into the maw of Disrupt -- more here, see you there -- but there was a lot of news all the same.So, here's what we got to:AngelList is doubling down on rolling funds, driving that SaaS revenue into the firm that is also investing in the rolling funds. So that's neat. (Really!)Edtech stayed hot this week with Byju's raising $500 million from Silver Lake. Founded back in 2011, Byju's is the highest-valued edtech company that we can think of, now worth $10.8 billion.And speaking of Silver Lake, the group just poured $1 billion into a part of the Reliance empire, this time Reliance Retail. And we talked about JioMart, which is taking on both Flipkart and Amazon in the country.Next there were two companies with names that start with \"S\" that raised $100 million in the last week, namely Snyk -- more here -- and Sprinklr -- more here.Sticking to our \"S\" theme, Slack's earnings were incredibly interesting. The company's quarter didn't get plaudits from investors, and it did note some negative COVID impacts that could impact startups as well.And, one more S-company to get through: Snowflake. We were all a-twitter about the company's new valuation range and fact that fucking Berkshire Hathaway is going to invest in it. That's wild! What a thing!Finally on the IPO front, we did a quick Palantir update. Danny has all the latest here.We wrapped with whatever this is, which was at least good for a laugh.

Reed Hastings is not big on working from home. And China's fight with Australia is escalating, again showing how willing China is to become an ostracized internationally; in business terms this makes the India market more important to tech companies.New IPO filings are out from both JFrog and Sumo Logic. We're going for a dive soon, but the short riff is that JFrog wants up to $37 per share, valuing it at more than $3 billion while Sumo Logic wants $21 per share, valuing it at more than $2 billion. (More here on Sumo Logic and here on JFrog.)Big rounds: Byju has put together a half-billion dollars at a $10.8 billion valuation, while Mollie has stacked on $106 million at a valuation that makes it a unicorn.Small rounds: Fashionphile has raised $38.5 million, Cloudentity raised $13 million, and Sarbacane has raised $27 million.And as we recorded, tech shares were set to sell off yet again.

An extra shoutout to Natasha this week as we spent a lot of time talking about edtech, a category that she spearheads for us and has brought to the show. It's a big deal!We're on YouTube now, don't forget, and with that, let's get into the news:Climax Foods raised $7.5 million to help fuel its work to develop alt-foods that are not animal-based. The Equity crew votes that this is a tasty deal. And, Capchase has raised $4.6 million to help cash-out SaaS contracts ahead of their real revenue accrual. Our read is that more financing options for SaaS companies will lead to lower costs of capital for those startups that want it. And, the Envision Accelerator made it through batch one and is on to batch two.Then we chatted about edtech, with Natasha talking us through Owl Ventures raising huge new funds, Course Hero extending its Series B, Juni hitting $10M ARR and raising about as much, and Unacademy raising tons of cash from Vision Fund 2.Next up, Patreon also got a new check, which means that it eventually has to go public at some point given that it is now a fancy unicorn.And speaking of IPOs, Bumble is thinking about going public in 2021, Wish has filed, albeit privately, and GoodRX is going public as well. And it makes money.What else? This a16z post on IPOs that we fangirl\/fanboy'd over as it is good.

You can follow the show on Twitter here, and myself here, and don\u2019t forget to check out last Friday\u2019s episode.This weekend was a welcome reprieve from last week's insane news cycle inside the world of technology and money. If you are still catching your breath from the Great IPO Wave of last Monday, we feel you. Here's what we got into this morning:The TikTok sale could be in trouble, this time due to China changing its rules on sales of tech firms that have certain algorithms. TikTok parent company Bytedance intends to comply with the rules, but what impact the news could have the sale of the social service is unclear as of yet, though the developments are not good if you were in favor of a deal.American tech shares are set to rise once again after setting records last week.Equity is back on YouTube, hell yeah!From the weekend: Medium's growth in both traffic (pageviews) and income (paying subscribers) is super impressive according to its latest reporting. And the publishing platform and media company is doubling-down on product to fend off upstarts like the popular Substack. Per a Bloomberg report, tech IPO fundraising could set a record in 2020. And, to ground us in a macro-economic sense, Chinese banks are being forced to take a profit hit to support other companies.In the funding round domain, Semalytix raised \u20ac4.3 million in Series A funding according to TechCrunch for its pharmaceutical-AI service. And India-based Eruditus raised $113 million for its executive-focused education service. That's a lot of money, but like we've been saying, edtech is hot.And, finally, will there be enough horns for all these hot SaaS rounds that are getting done in a blur today? What if SaaS revenue multiples slip by 20%? Then what? When deals go so fast that due diligence suffers, the hangover can last a bit.And that is the week's Monday ep, thanks for sticking with through our super-busy week last week. Whew!

Happily we've managed to hold it together amidst the news deluge that the last few days have brought. It was a good week for our scheduling change, with the main episode of the show coming to you on Thursday afternoon versus Friday morning.Change is good.But unchanging this time around was our hosting lineup, with Natasha Mascarenhas and Danny Crichton and myself yammering with Chris Gates on the mix. Here's what we got into:The CEO of TikTok is out, bids are swirling, and whom will wind up owning a piece of all of TikTok's global operations is not clear. Walmart is in the mix, apparently, which feels very 2020.The New York Stock Exchange has gotten approval from the SEC for a new type of direct listing, one in which the company going public can sell a bloc of shares during the normal price discovery process. This means that all the banker-faff of setting a price and roadshowing to various investor groups could be going the way of the buffalo.About time, maybe? That was our take after reading this Bill Gurley note and the latest SEC news.But while the direct listing world is getting more interesting, the SPAC world is taking flight. Desktop Metal is going public via a SPAC which is all sorts of fascinating. A younger, Boston-based unicorn going public in this manner is eye catching!And then two funding rounds, the first from Finix, which can't stop adding to its Series B. And Mural, which raised the largest Series B we can recall.And with that, we're all going to bed. We're tired. No more news, thanks!

That so many filings dropped during the same two days when we had Y Combinator's two-day Demo Day at the same time meant that we were all a bit punchdrunk, but we rallied.Natasha and Danny and Chris and myself all piled back onto the mics to dig through all the numbers. Here's a rundown of the companies we went through:Palantir, which filed its formal S-1 during our recording session. Danny covered most of the news last Friday, but the public doc is now live, so happy sleuthing.Unity's huge IPO that shows how big gaming is. Natasha connected it to the broader Apple-Epic dustup, and we all reviled in its growth results.Snowflake had Danny so excited he was conjuring scripted segues, and we were all impressed at its historical growth. Sure, it lost a lot of money last year, but, hey, Snowflake has dialed that back as well.And then there was Asana, a company I've covered quite a lot over the years. Our general take is that the company's growth has been good, if it is losing more money than we anticipated. Still, Asana could set a neat new precedent of raising debt ahead of a direct listing. This is one to watch.And then we spent a little time on JFrog and Sumo Logic (more here), because we are nothing if not completionists.Got all of that? It was a lot of facts to get through, but we did our best and we hope this helps. More tomorrow as we talk Y Combinator with a special guest host. Chat tomorrow!

This episode, apparently. A big thanks to Chris Gates for helping us trim the fat and make something good for you.Before we get into the topics of the week, don't forget that Equity is not back on YouTube most weeks, so if you wanted to see us do the talking with some fun extra from the production team, you can do so here. More to come once I get my new external camera to work.That done, here's what Natasha and Danny and I got into this week:The public markets are afire these days with Apple reaching $2 trillion in market cap, and Tesla's stock doing all sorts of odd things. In short, stocks have only gone up for a while and that means that there's warm, nigh-stuffy temperatures around assets of all types.This is leading to a surge in liquidity, unsurprisingly, as asset managers of all types look to take advantage of the times. So, Asana is prepping a direct listing, Airbnb has filed privately, And ThredUp is eyeing an early-2021 IPO. Around the same time as Coinbase, we'd reckon.Airbnb banned parties as well, which wound up being the title of the show.And SPACs are still happening in rapid-fire fashion. The Equity crew is not super impressed about the whole affair, but I'll say that with Paul \"Fucking\" Ryan involved, it's probably a sign of the top.And capping the liquidity chat, Natasha ran us through what Chamath is up to now, and Danny rabbited on about Kabbage.Funding rounds! Welcome raised a $1.4 million check that I covered, Labster raised $9 million that Natasha wrote about, Carrot Fertility picked up $24 million that we all thought was pretty smart, and our friends at Crunchbase News wrote about PadSplit, which is honestly neat but we ran low on time after spending too much time on SPACs. Check them out here.Whew! We're doing a lot over at TechCrunch.com, so, stay tuned and know that if we were a bit frazzled this week it's because we're working our backends off to bring you neat things.

You can follow the show on Twitter here, and myself here, and don\u2019t forget to check out last Friday\u2019s episode.This morning we had a bit of a detour, wandering into the world of BigTech to wonder what is going on with those megacorps. Too big for their own good, or too big to be good, here's what's up with the incumbents:Germany is taking on Amazon at the very same time that Canada is taking on Amazon, meaning that the Seattle giant is taking shots from two key markets at the same time.Google is having a war of words with Australia, after a ruling in the country didn't go its way.Walled gardens are seeing their walls come under heavy fire, which means that Apple and Google are fighting both sides of their marketplaces (producers, consumers) at once at the moment, which isn't great.And Microsoft might buy TikTok.All told it seems that the biggest tech companies are busy defending their market position instead of re-earning it with great products. A good time for startups? I think so. When incumbents are busy fighting with governments, themselves, and each other, it's a great time to show up, steal a march, and build neat products that take away their momentum.On the funding front, we peeked at the neat Help Lightning round, the Agiloft investment, and the Vertafore exit.And then there was this report concerning Asana, which is growing nicely for a company of its size and could actually be cheap at its current price? Anyway, we want the company to get on with getting public so that we can read its S-1 filing. Give it to us!All that and we had some fun, chat soon!

And as always, it was key to have the full crew as there was an ocean of news to get through. Before we get into the show, make sure you've checked out Danny's latest work on the TechCrunch List and let's get into it:The TikTok saga continues: This week we spent a few minutes discussing why bankers are incentivized to make the proposed TikTok-Microsoft deal as competitive as possible. Or at least make it look as competitive as possible. And, there's some data from inside Microsoft about how the deal is being viewed.Airbnb could file to go public this month! It might go public before the year is out! That's way better than we expected. (Bloomberg got its Q2 finances.)Palantir could file for a direct listing next month! That's great. We wanted to know what Palantir really is, namely a consultancy or a tech company. And then we played valuation bingo so that we can look back later and mock ourselves.I was very excited about the Duck Creek IPO. Few of my friends joined me in being excited.The three of us also took a minute to riff on the latest Pinterest news, namely that it's poorly run and is sexist per its now-former COO. We'd love to stop covering these stories, but they keep happening so, on we go.Danny had some neat SPAC data to share, helping illustrate that SPACs are not merely a meme, they are a real, driving force of public company action this year. As was Tesla's announced stock split, which led us to ask why a few times.Next up, Natasha walked us through her latest work digging into how GenZ is shaking up the funding world. We framed the changes in some historical context, and decided that really in the end the kids are alright.Danny brought us to a close, with a note on Conduit (connecting founders and early-stage investors) and Circle (creator software). Both are worth your time.And that was our show! We are back Monday morning. Stay cool!

You can follow the show on Twitter here, and myself here, and don\u2019t forget to check out last Friday\u2019s episode.This morning was a bit of a grab-bag of news, but of course we had to start off with the biggest story from the past few weeks:It's TikTok around the clock: News broke recently that Twitter could be interested in TikTok after Apple came and somewhat went as a possible suitor. What matters is that Microsoft is not a full-lock on TikTok's exit. No word lately on whether the Trump administration's decision to try to extort a chunk of the sale price will go through.

We had Chris on the dials and a pile of news to get through, so we were pretty hype heading into the show.But before we could truly get started we had to discuss Cincinnati, and TikTok. Pleasantries and extortion out of the way, we got busy:Ecommerce and fintech stay hot as Square reported big earnings, Shopify and Etsy do well, and more. We tied this to recent VC results in the fintech space, which saw a record number of $100 million rounds in Q2. There were some signs of weakness elsewhere, but the general state of things in tech is surprisingly hot, given the pandemic and recession.Gumroad founder Sahil Lavingia has a new seed fund that he built in collaboration with AngelList.D2C women's-health startup Stix raised a $1.3 million Seed round.Quantum-computing startup Rigetti raised a $79 million Series C.Rippling raised $145 million at an eye-popping $1.35 billion valuation; the company's last value, set a year ago, was $270 million.AgentSync put together a $4.4 million Seed round to help bring APIs to insurtech.Turning away from funding to some neat product news, India-based Statiq is building a bootstrapped EV-charging network.And as we wrapped, the Byju-WhiteHat Jr. deal was neat, JIO is soaking up a huge amount of Indian VC, and Natasha's latest piece on learning pods had us arguing about what things are worth.It was another fun week!

To which we have to say that the EV boom and SPAC crush are going to fuse and lose some people a lot of money. Not this deal, necessarily, mind.Google is dumping money into ADT as part of a Nest deal.And Zoom's latest move regarding the Chinese market feels like a harbinger of times to come.On the TikTok front, Microsoft never really fully abandoned consumer hardware and software, it just pruned deeply under its current CEO Satya Nadella. Windows Phone? Gone. Surface? Bigger than ever. Mixer? No. Bing? Yep. That sort of thing. And Microsoft, like any modern super-platform, doesn't just want to own your time when you are at work. It wants to burn your eyes out around the clock.For a host of ByteDance backers like Yuri Milner, Sequoia Capital China, General Atlantic, SoftBank, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the deal could be rather lucrative, we presume.Rounds for Wejo (coverage here), Lezzoo (coverage here), and Feather (coverage here).Finally,\u00a0why does Microsoft want to buy TikTok? We had a number of ideas that all sort of summed to\u00a0maybe, but when we ran through the big tech companies that were possible suitors -- ports in the Trump storm -- maybe Microsoft makes more sense than we would have guessed?Whatever the case, we can't wait until Satya announces the deal by dancing and pointing at text on a screen while wearing something silly.

As a tiny programming note, we're going back to posting some videos on YouTube in a few weeks, so make sure to peep the TechCrunch channel if that's your jam. And we did a special episode on the SPAC boom, if you are into financial arcana. For more on SPAC's --> hereThe Equity crew tried something new this week, namely centering our main conversation around a theme that we're keeping tabs on: The resilience of tech during the current pandemic-led recession.Starting with the recent economic news, it's surprising that tech's layoffs have slowed to a crawl. And, as we've recently seen, there's still plenty of money flowing into startups, even if there are some dips present on a year-over-year basis. Why are things still pretty good for startups, and pretty good for major tech companies? We have a few ideas, like the acceleration of the digital transformation (more here, and here), and software eating the world. The latter concept, of course, is related to the former.After that it was time to go through some neat funding rounds from the week, including:Dumpling raising $6.5 million to help individual shoppers build their own Instacart;Kibbo's shot at making the #vanlife happen for more folks, something that we think is a good fit for the pandemic and the mobile professional.Sora's $5.3 million raise for no-code HR connective tissue, something that I was rather bullish on but drew some chat about no-code itself, and if the trend is more hype than substance.All that and I have a newsletter launching this weekend that if you read, you will automatically be 100% cooler.

But that didn't stop the Equity crew from sitting down to chat about the recent wave of SPAC commentaryDanny and I wanted to talk about what a SPAC is -- the acronym stands for\u00a0special purpose acquisition company -- and why everyone seems to be chatting them up.Why do you care? Here's some context, in simple bullet-point format:Yesterday, after raising its IPO price range, Jamf priced at $26 per share, selling more shares than it had previously anticipated.Today it opened trading around $48, and is currently worth $40.18 per share, far above its IPO price.Recent first-day gains, like Jamf's own, have peeved elements of the venture classes who think that the gap between an IPO price and where a company first trades is money that Wall Street bankers, and the IPO process itself, have stolen.Enter SPACs, which\u00a0could offer a way for unicorns and other venture-backed companies to go public through a different pricing mechanism. If that alternative method of pricing the company would be better is not clear, but we tried to talk it through.Equity is back Friday morning, of course. And please bear in mind that when I referred to \"Robinhood dipshits,\" I was talking about all retail investors as a cohort, not merely the folks at any one particular trading platform. Thanks to the in-market prestige of Robinhood, however, I did use it as short-hand for retail investors more broadly.Oh, and follow the show on Twitter.

I don't know precisely, but the electric car (EV) industry has certainly seen its fair share of ups and downs. China's EV market has see its booms and busts, with the IPO of Nio operating as a good example of enthusiasm (its IPO), declining faith (its later cratering share price), and the rebirth of optimism (its recent return-to-form) in its industry.Xpeng's huge new Series C+ round and the huge valuation that Tesla has managed as a public company in recent months add currency to the idea that the EV market has once again swung towards too much optimism.

That's not\u00a0really what happened, but it sounds better than actually went down at Big Social.Anyway, Twitter accounts or not, the three of us gathered to parse through a wave of news:The new TechCrunch List that Danny spent a very long time compiling has arrived! It's live! You can find it here. It is good.And, if you want to know which VCs were even more f\u00eated by founders, head here. (If you are irked that you did not make either list, please email Danny, not the show!)Moving on, Google is putting billions into Reliance Jio after every other company in the world did the same. Google is buying a bit less of the Indian telecom than the search giant, but between the two of them it's been more than $10 billion in dealmaking. Perhaps Reliance Jio is done raising money? At last?Udemy is hunting up more capital at a higher valuation, reports say, providing Natasha with the perfect moment to let us know what is going with edtech.Turning to funding rounds, I was hype about the Macro round that TechCrunch covered this week, Danny wanted to chat about The Browser Company's similarly-sized $5 million round, and Natasha talked us through LiteBoxer's combined $6 million in new capital.Closing, we talked about IPOs for a hot second. The IPO window is open, and now that nCino and GoHealth have gone public, we want to know who is next.It was a lovely time and there is a bit of show news.

Here's the round-up of news that we had to talk about:Qualcomm pours capital into India's Reliance Jio, which has now raised $15.7 billion in the past three months.Google intends to invest $10 billion into India over the next five to seven years, looking to put capital to work in through a mix of \"a mix of equity investments, partnerships, and operational, infrastructure and ecosystem investments\" via a new \"Google for India Digitization Fund.\"And, Google has education plans in India. India! It's a big deal!WeWork might turn cash flow positive in 2021. That's still a ways from now, but it does go to show that deep under the flesh of whatever WeWork claimed to be during its 2019 IPO process, there was a real company somewhere in its bones. How\u00a0large a company is not clear.UIPath raised $225 million in a Series E that values it at over $10 billion. The company's ARR has quadrupled to $400 million in the past few years.Finally, US tech's response to the Hong Kong \"security\" law that isn't.Up ahead we have a fascinating earnings season, one that the media doesn't expect to go very well. Stocks were up as we wrote the show, so it appears that Wall Street is more bullish than worried. We'll see. Netflix reports later this week. Then, next week, we really get underway with Snap, IBM, Microsoft, and others.We also touched on three funding rounds: More money for cancer-focusedAI startup Paige, $6.3 million for FitXR to keep working on its fitness VR work, and this small round from Russia, which reminded us that you can build a startup even in a failing democracy.https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/10\/what-do-investors-bidding-up-tech-shares-know-that-the-rest-of-us-dont\/Wrapping, this earnings season is a big deal. Lots of tech investors are betting that an accelerated digital transformation is going to push most tech shops into a growth curve that makes their equity attractive, even at elevated prices. Quite a lot of capital has been sunk in this idea. We'll see what happens when the numbers come in.

So, climb aboard with Danny, Natasha, and myself for another episode of Equity.Before we get into topics, a reminder that if you are signing up for Extra Crunch and want to save some money, the code \"equity\" is your friend. Alright, let's get into it:     Robinhood is back in the news this week after a New York Times piece dug into its history, product decisions, and more. Tidbits galore are to be had, but the Equity crew wanted to debate the morality of providing exotic financial tooling to less-experienced users.     We followed that debate with a dive into immigration, the latest news from the government, and our takes on the matter. TechCrunch has covered the recent news, and provided some context on the broader concept. Our takeaway is that doing self-defeating things for no reason isn't brilliant for the country as a whole.     Postmates has a home! After winding up somewhere in the middle of the pack of the on-demand cohort a few years back, the rise of DoorDash put Postmates in a pickle. Happily, Uber was on hand to de-brine the unicorn for $2.65 billion in stock. That's a bit more money than Postmates' last valuation. What we want to know next is how the sale price impacted common stockholders. Email us if you know.     Palantir has filed to go public, but privately, so that's really all there is to say about that. Unless you need a history lesson.     Finally, funding rounds. We had three this week: MonkeyLearn raising $2.2 million for no-code AI, Quaestor raising $5.8 million for startup financial tooling, and $4.5 million for Mmhmm which is both timely and neat.Whew! Past all that we had some fun, and, hopefully, were of some use. Hugs and chat Monday!

(You can follow the show on Twitter here, and myself here, if you are so inclined! Don't forget to check out last Friday's episode as well. All the cool kids are doing it.)What a weekend! After some quiet, somewhat dull off-week periods, this weekend brought us twists and turns that were good fun. Most dealt with a possible Uber-Postmates tie up, so we wrote the show to talk about the transaction's unconfirmed nature.Then, it got confirmed. So, here's the second edition of today's Equity Monday, recast due to the deal's official nature:Uber will buy Postmates for $2.65 billion in an all-stock transaction. Uber shares were up this morning ahead of the open on the wings of the rumor -- wings that beat even harder after the deal was confirmed. Uber investors seem pleased, for now, that after losing out on GrubHub their company has managed to buy a smaller player. Doing so may give Uber more leverage over restaurants and drivers, and boost Uber's H2 2020 revenue numbers that will still be impacted by COVID-19 and its resulting economic impacts.Q3 earnings don't kick off for tech and other VC-backed companies for a bit, and heading into the week the public markets are up. Despite all the bad news. The inverse correlation between bad news (short-term, economic), and stock market gains is slowly moving from joke to sordid reality.This week we're keeping tabs on US and Chinese economic data, the geopolitical situation in Hong Kong and the India-China border, and Q2 VC data as it comes out.We also dug into three funding rounds this morning, detailing Scalefast raising $22 million, DigniFi raising $14 million, and AirVet raising $14 million as well. More international rounds to come, we promise.We wrapped this morning wondering if Postmates can provide a narrative boost to Uber, a company that isn't going to have the best Q2 numbers in its history. With Postmates tucked under its arm going into the earnings call, Uber can double-down on its Uber Eats narrative, flash Postmates around the room, and promise that Rides data will get better as well.

It's fun!Back to task, listen, we're tired too. But we didn't let that stop us from packing this week's Equity to the very gills with news and notes and jokes and fun. Hopefully you can chuckle along with myself and Natasha and Danny and Chris on the dials as we riffed through all of this:Journalism, venture capitalists, and not being a colossal jerk: Listen in for more, but there's once again a brouhaha in the world of technology twitter and media twitter concerning whether journalists should write more positive things about tech companies (no), and if venture capitalists are a bit too thin-skinned for their net worth (yes).Lemonade's IPO went kaboom out of the gate, more than doubling in value. But the CEO isn't too worried. I spoke with him before we recorded and he was more interested in getting a bedrock of solid, long-term investors than extracting every possible dollar in their raise. And Lemonade had a bunch of money already, so it wasn't a huge concern.We also spent a minute on the possible Uber-Postmates deal, that\u00a0could get announced early next week. That or Postmates really is serious about going public. We'll see.Next up we had to talk about Mirror, Lululemon, and what's up with home fitness. Is the trend here to stay? Natasha thinks so, and the rest of the crew are pretty bullish as well. Especially as it is not like we are going to get back to life anytime soon.After that it was time to get to a few funding rounds, including the latest from Neo.Tax, and a check-in on the early-stage Lessonbee, which sounds really cool.We also crammed in a quick word on Contrary Capital and startup mafias, the Envision accelerator, Discord's latest $100 million round, and we closed with the Final Luckin Letdown.Whew!Right, that's our ep.

As TechCrunch reported, \"the U.S. Department of Justice has brought two criminal wire fraud charges against him, charges that he made two false statements to a bank, and money laundering charges, all of which could result in a very long time in prison depending on how things play out.\"Q2 is coming to a close this week, and many American companies are taking Friday off. Expect news to slow into the end of the week.But, this week, South Korean gaming company DoubleDown Interactive is looking to raise $200 million by going public this week in the United States. That's going to be exciting to watch.Instead of picking individual funding rounds, we covered some notes on the Indian startup market. LiveMint, Times of India, and Entrackr all covered recent venture data, showing a booming India edtech market amidst a weaker VC landscape. If it turns out that rest of the world's VC scenes are in similar straits, we could be entering something similar to a VC recession.Finally, Bloomberg's Joe Weisenthal is writing about how the stock market actually\u00a0is tracking the economy. This is counter to the cliche that the stock market\u00a0isn't the economy. But his argument helps explain something about the startup market that has stuck out for a while, namely why did startup layoffs drop sharply and churn decline quickly in Q2? Well, maybe things got better?And that's Equity for today. We're back Friday morning!

It would have been hard to not be, given how much good stuff there was to chew over.We kicked off with two funding rounds from companies that had received a headwind from COVID-19:Away raises new capital, reported to be $30 million to $40 million after revenue declinesSonder raises $170 million at a higher $1.3 billion valuation after seeing its hospitality business recoverThose two rounds, however, represented just one side of the COVID coin. There were also companies busy riding a COVID-tailwind to the tune of new funds:\u00a0Hopin raised a $40 million Series A as its virtual events business acceleratedDoNotPay raised an $18 million round at an $80 million valuationBut we had room for one more story. So, we talked a bit about Robinhood, its business model, and the recent suicide of one of its users. It's an awful moment for the family of the human we lost, but also a good moment for Robinhood to batten the hatches a bit on how its service works.https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/23\/amidst-robinhoods-planned-service-changes-a-tension-between-growth-and-safety\/How far the company will go, however, in limiting access to certain financial tooling, will be interesting to see. The company generates lots of revenue from its order-flow business, and options are a key part of those incomes. Robinhood is therefore balancing the need to protect its users, and make money from their actions. How they thread this needle will be quite interesting.All that we had a lot of fun.

You can follow us on @EquityPodThe COVID-19 pandemic hit a new, worse milestone over the weekend. What is ahead for the global economy is not clear, but the horizon is not clear for startups big and small.Many tech firms in the US took Juneteenth off, limiting recent news, and with WWDC starting today there's going to be something akin to a Cupertino takeover for the next few days. If you don't care about Apple, you can just take some time off.Stocks are heading up this morning, with tech shares testing new records.Mexico's Heartbest raised a $2 million Series A to help develop plant-based dairy replacements, and San Francisco's Acquire raised a $6.4 million Series A to help with its customer success service. Blue Horizon Ventures and Base10 led the rounds, respectively.And, finally, the Hey-Apple drama reaches WWDC today. Apple has signaled that no changes are coming, but the company is in water that feels fractionally hotter with each passing day. What Apple can do to repair relations with developers who are more than a little worried about the megacorp isn't clear. But for startups, the final results of this scrap could really matter.And that is that. Equity is back Friday with more. Have a great week!

But, first, three things to start us off:First: Read this piece from TechCrunch's Megan Rose Dickey about Juneteenth and tech companies. This podcast is going out on Juneteenth, so before you hit play, please take a minute to learn more about the day and its significance.Second:\u00a0Danny and Arman from the TechCrunch team have finally launched TechCrunch List, a huge effort to determine which investors are really willing to write early checks. You can find out more here.Third: Equity is now on Twitter. Follow us here or understand that you are not cool.All that said, here's what we talked about on the show:\u00a0Epic Games is looking to raise a huge stack of cash (Bloomberg, VentureBeat) at a new, higher valuation. We were curious about how its lower-cut store could help it gain inroads with developers big and small. That part of the chat, the take-rate of the Fortnite parent company on the work of others was very cogent to the other main topic of the day:Apple vs. DHH. So Hey launched this week, and the new spin on email quickly overshadowed its product launch by getting into a spat with Apple about whether it needs to add the ability to sign up for the paid service on iOS, thus giving Apple a cut of its revenue. DHH and crew do not agree.

This is Equity Monday, our short-form week-starter in which we go over the weekend, look to the week ahead, talk about some neat funding rounds, and dig into what is stuck on our minds.So, by section then:The Weekend:The market narrative seems to have changed from optimism to pessimism, impacting stock prices and possibly closing the IPO window some, after it had unexpectedly opened.Quibi news is out that isn't great: The mobile-first launch that came during a lockdown hasn't helped the hugely-funded service that had to convince the world that its content format was great. We calculate its effective cost-per-subscriber number and it isn't super great.The Week Ahead:Earnings from Groupon and Oracle. The former could tell us a little bit about the health of the consumer perhaps? And Oracle is a player in the cloud space, so its earnings might help us understand what's up in that world. See, not everything cloud-related comes from Seattle.And we note the grip of tech conferences that were put on hold due to COVID-19, wondering what they might look like next year; do we ever go back to the way that things used to be?Funding Rounds:Duck Creed raises $230 million, which Bloomberg notes as a pre-IPO round.Appfire, also from Boston, raises a $49 million round. We want to read this S-1, badly.Tonik raises $21 million to launch a Southeast Asian digital bank.What's On Our Minds:The Exchange launches today, which you can learn more about over on TechCrunch.com.

Thankfully we had our full contingent on hand: Danny \"Well, you see\" Crichton, Natasha \"Talk to me post-pandemic\" Mascarenhas, Alex \"Very shouty\" Wilhelm, and behind the scenes, Chris \"The Dad\" Gates.Make sure to check out our IPO-focused Equity Shot from earlier this week if you haven't yet, and let's get into today's topics:Instacart raises $225 million. This round, not unexpected, values the on-demand grocery delivery startup at $13.7 billion -- a huge sum, and one that should make it harder for the well-known company to sell itself to anyone but the public markets. Regardless, COVID-19 gave this company a huge updraft, and it capitalized on it.Pando raises $8.5 million. We often cover rounds on Equity that are a little obvious. SaaS, that sort of thing. Pando is not that. Instead, it's a company that wants to let small groups of individual pool their upside and allow for more equal outcomes in an economy that rewards outsized success.Ethena raises $2 million. Anti-harassment software is about as much fun as the dentist today, but perhaps that doesn't have to be the case. Natasha talked us through the company, and its pricing. I'm pretty bullish on Ethena, frankly. Homebrew, Village Global, and GSV took part in the financing event.Vendr raises $4 million. Vendr wants to help companies cut their SaaS bills, through its own SaaS-esque product. I tried to explain this, but may have butchered it a bit. It's cool, I promise.Facebook is getting into the CVC game. This should not be a surprise, but we were also not sure who was going to want Facebook money.And, finally, Collab Capital is raising a $50 million fund to invest in Black founders. Per our reporting, the company is on track to close on $10 million in August. How fast the fund can close its full target is something we're going to keep an eye on, considering it might get a lot harder a lot sooner.\u00a0And that is that, thanks for lending us your ears.\u00a0        ","duration_ms":1658253,"explicit":false,"external_urls":{"spotify":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/episode\/4VI3GwGBY7FrQdD6zyqDZK"},"href":"https:\/\/api.spotify.com\/v1\/episodes\/4VI3GwGBY7FrQdD6zyqDZK","id":"4VI3GwGBY7FrQdD6zyqDZK","images":[{"height":640,"url":"https:\/\/i.scdn.co\/image\/3c84a5c82d2faa39112da6e3d72a6c4d0993393a","width":640},{"height":300,"url":"https:\/\/i.scdn.co\/image\/574a35ba6ab332471953ce21cb4171c11e58179c","width":300},{"height":64,"url":"https:\/\/i.scdn.co\/image\/a499d8d34e2e8a4e86c8e268c298422bd2a481fc","width":64}],"is_externally_hosted":false,"is_playable":true,"language":"en","languages":["en"],"name":"Take Facebook money and get cloned","release_date":"2020-06-12","release_date_precision":"day","type":"episode","uri":"spotify:episode:4VI3GwGBY7FrQdD6zyqDZK"},{"audio_preview_url":"https:\/\/p.scdn.co\/mp3-preview\/2bf193405e38ee4416a3024f525b3f3e4874ad4d","description":"         Hello and welcome back to\u00a0Equity, TechCrunch\u2019s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.This time around we're recording what we call an Equity Shot, a single-topic show that we pull together whenever there's a news item of sufficient weight that it demands we break our regular cadence and record a little more.So Danny and Tash and Alex got together to discuss the recent Vroom IPO and Lemonade filing to go public. These are topics that TechCrunch has covered quite a lot lately, so here's a chronology to help you keep it all straight:We dug into Vroom's economics detailed in its IPO filingTechCrunch covered\u00a0hoped-for price rangeWe reported on Vroom's raised IPO pricing rangeLemonade filed to go public and we dig into its numbersA bit more on the Lemonade IPO filing and what we can learn from itAnd here's our coverage on Vroom's final IPO pricingSo you can catch up as you need to. What matters is that public investors have\u00a0swooned over the Vroom IPO, pushing its pricing and, today, more than doubling its value as a public company. It's a huge debut, and that bodes well for other gross-margin light businesses -- unicorns, even -- that might want to go public.The IPO window is pretty open, it appears.

Equity Monday is still pretty new, frankly, so him stepping up and into the role was a huge boon. Thanks, Danny.Right, so, what did we talk about today?In the face of outrageous police action and systemic racism, most of tech -- both public and private, alike -- said something or did something in the last few days. We go over some of the latest statements and pledges from the VC and startup world in the episode, but do take a look for yourself and decide if what's been done and said is enough.For more, read this.Coming up this week: Zoom earnings. Zoom's earnings report matters a bit more than a regular digest of three-months' worth of corporate performance. The company is a key plank in the group of companies are have been buoyed by COVID-19 pandemic, meaning that investors that have made similar bets will have their eyes on the videochatting giant's results. And, SaaS and cloud stocks are trading at all-time highs. If Zoom can turn in good numbers, that run might be able to continue.Tia Health put together nearly $25 million for women-centric telehealth.Beam, a micromobility startup headquartered in Singapore, raised $26 million.And, finally, fintech layoffs. I was off last week but was a bit surprised at the number of fintech companies that were cutting staff. Why? Well, we have a guess or two on that count.

This week's show took a break from regularly scheduled programming. Our co-host Alex Wilhelm, who usually leads us through the show, was on some deserved vacation, so Danny Crichton and Natasha Mascarenhas took the reigns and invited Floodgate Capital's Iris Choi to join in on the fun. It's Choi's fourth time being on the podcast, which officially makes her our most tenured guest yet (in case the accomplished investor needs another bullet point on her bio page).This week's docket features scrappiness, a seed round, and a Startup battlefield alumnus.Here's what we chewed through:LeverEdge raised seed funding to get you and your friends a volume discount on student loans. Fintech has been booming for years now, and startups often crop up around the painful wolrd of student loans. Yet this startup still caught our eye, and it has a little something to do with its choice to use collective bargaining power as its modus operandi.Stackin' raises $12.6M Series B for a text-messaging service that connects millennials to money tips, and eventually other fintech apps. According to CEO Scott Grimes, Stackin' wants to be the \"pipes that port people around fintech.\" We get into if the world needs a fintech app marketplace and how it targets younger users.D-ID, a Startup Battlefield alumnus, digitally de-identifies faces in videos and still images and just raised $13.5 million. We're all worried about our privacy concerns, so the funding news was a refreshing change of pace from the usual headlines we see around surveillance. Now the company just needs to find a successful use case beyond the goodness in people's hearts.ByteDance, the Chinese parent company that owns TikTok, hit $3 Billion in net profit last year, reports Bloomberg. TikTok also recently snagged former Disney executive Kevin Mayer for its CEO. This one, as you can expect, made for an interesting conversation around privacy and bandwidth. We even asked Choi to weigh in on Donald J. Trump's recent tweet threatening to regulate social media companies, since Floodgate was an early angel investor in Twitter.We ended with a round table of sorts on how the future of work will look and feel in our new world, from college campuses to offices. We get into the vulnerability that comes with being on Zoom, the ever-increasing stupidity of \"manels\", and how tech talent might be flocking to smaller cities but investors aren't just yet.And that was the show! Thanks to our producer Chris Gates for helping us put to this together, thanks to you all for listening in on this quirky episode, and thanks to Iris Choi for always bringing a fresh, candid perspective.

The crew is chewing over what you said now, and we'll roll up the best feedback into show tweaks in the future.Today, though, we've gone Danny and Natasha and Chris and Alex back again for our regular news dive. This week we had to leave the Vroom IPO filing, Danny's group project on The Future of Work, and a handwashing startup (?) from Natasha to get to the very biggest stories:Brex's $150 million raise: Natasha covered the latest huge round from corporate charge-card behemoth Brex. The party's over in Silicon Valley for a little while, so Brex is turning down your favorite startup's credit limit while it stacks cash for the dowturn.Spruce raises a $29 Series B: Led by Scale Venture Partners, Spruce is taking on the world of real estate transactions with digital tooling and an API. As Danny notes, it's a huge market and one that could find a boost from the pandemic.Masterclass raises $100 million: Somewhere between education and entertainment, Masterclass has found its niche. The startup's $180 yearly subscription product appears to be performing well, given that the company just stacked nine-figures into its checking account. What's it worth? The company would only tell Natasha that it was more than $800 million.Clubhouse does, well, you know. Clubhouse happened. So we talked about it.SoftBank dropped its earnings lately, which gave Danny time to break out his pocket calculator and figure out how much money it spent daily, and Alex time to parse the comedy that its slideshow entailed.

Also, we're running a listener survey which you can find here, in the last ep's shownotes. And finally, I am off next week, so Danny Crichton will take over Equity Monday for us.

But unlike last week's episode (catch up here if you are behind), this week's show features a game that actually worked. It's at the end, as you'll see.But before that piece of the puzzle, there was a bunch of news to go over. We had to leave SaaS valuations, the Liftoff List, Brex, and FalconX on the floor, but there was still so much good stuff to cover:Slice raised $43 million from KKR, making us all rather hungry -- and curious. Where does Slice fit into the food-delivery market, and does its restaurant-friendly model give it enough room to grow revenue so that its new valuation makes sense?The Uber Eats-Grubhub deal was an unavoidable topic this week, given that it has the chance to remake the food delivery landscape. What room would be left in the market for Postmates? And would it pass regulatory scrutiny? We're curious.Sticking to the on-demand theme, Instacart has grown\u00a0bonkers-quick in the last few months, even making some money in the process. We're impressed.It's not the only thing out there growing like hell -- Shopify is also putting up insane numbers, as reflected in its share price. TechCrunch took a look back through its history the other day.The secondary markets saw some consolidation this week, which brought back some fond memories.Quizlet raised $30 million at a $4 billion valuation, causing some consternation amongst the hosts. And Vise raised a more modest $14.5 million in a round that Danny covered.Then we played our game. Please hold us to account. And if you have listened to the show for a while, take our survey!

Walk joined us for an Extra Crunch Live chat late last week that was a mix of advice and insight about what the seed-stage Homebrew partner looks for in founders and companies to invest in.In the case of founders, \"attitude matters as much as aptitude sometimes,\" Walk said, adding that \"grit\" and \"resilience\" are things he favors in entrepreneurs. Why do those qualities matter? Walk cited the Mike Tyson quip about everyone having a plan until they get punched in the face, saying that \"building an early-stage startup, you get punched in the face almost daily.\"Form one line, folks considering building a new company.We also dug into fintech, where Walk and his Homebrew partner Satya Patel have made a number of investments that have turned out well, including Plaid, Finix, Chime and so on. According to Walk, his firm has made investments into the startup category across funds because it felt that two things were going to happen. First, that \"a lot of data that had been siloed and unavailable was going to become available,\" citing Plaid as an example of the trend.Second, that the top-down model of building tooling that made chiefs happier than front-line workers was going to flip in the financial world. New software was going to look quite different and focus on the individuals' needs. Chime, the American neobank, was his example of this trend bearing out in the market.

How are you holding up? Do you miss your commute yet? Just want to get some breakfast from a kitchen other than your own? I feel you.But it is Monday all the same and that means it's time for Equity, so let's get to it. You can hit play above and following along with notes:Kingsoft Cloud's IPO went well. Very well, in fact. Far better than expected if we're being honest. The company was recently gross-margin negative and is now public? In this economy?Vroom has filed privately to go public, which is pretty wild given that the capital markets are theoretically closed.Earnings this week are pretty light but keep an eye out for Cisco, JD.com, Sony and Tencent.Over the weekend, bitcoin crashed around 10 or 12 percent, depending on how you do the math. Right before the halvening. Surprised? I was.Shiprocket raised $13 million and Ermetic raised $10 million in two neat early-stage rounds worth your time.And finally, a call to arms. TechCrunch was once a dude in his backyard writing blogs and generally being mad online. It was great! Since then, blogs have grown up, sold out, been re-sold, and generally become part of the landscape if you are being generous (or part of the furniture if you aren't). Surely there's room for new, kickass media companies. Who is building one? They would be a real contrarian.

Perhaps this is just life now, and every week will stretch before us, similar to what Gandalf said after killing that Balrog, that \"every day was as long as the life age of the Earth.\"Anyhoo, we recorded Equity to try and make a little sense of the week as there was a lot going on. So, Natasha, Danny, and Alex once again gathered to parse it all. Here's a rough digest of the topics from this episode:Techstars' virtual demo days. Natasha and Alex are listening in to as many Techstars virtual demo confabs as they can along with other TC staff, pulling out favorites as we go. Today we dug into what is working, and what isn't with virtual demo days.While VC Twitter might make it seem like every firm is open for business, that is not the reality. We talk about signaling risk, external signs a firm is investing, and throw pro rata chat around in between.Peanut, a social network for women, raised $12 million and that is the good news we needed this week. Think of it as a better, cleaner and more intimate version of your favorite Facebook group. About 1.6 million are on the platform.Every Mother raised a small sum to bring safety and community to pre and post natal workouts for mothers.Robinhood's Series F. The new Robinhood round values the company at around $8.3 billion, a huge number but one that wasn't as high as we might have expected, given how much its valuation used to grow between new funding events.Airbnb cut 1,900 people in a devastating round of layoffs for the travel and hospitality company. We discuss o-founder and CEO Brian Chesky's detailed blogpost about the cuts, and whether it is better to be a public or a private company during this pandemic.Uber cut staff this week, and pumped money into a massive Lime downround that may see it offload its own micromobility business onto the smaller company. Not a good week for Uber, not a good week for Lime.We didn't get to chat API funding rounds or the unicorn retreat, or even really riff on earnings. There's so much going on!

Here's the rundown:Silver Lake is following Facebook into Jio, at a higher price. Facebook's huge bet on the Indian mobile Internet giant raised eyebrows, especially as the deal could have some interesting net neutrality implications. Silver Lake's follow-on deal only makes Facebook's investment all the more fascinating.Intel wants to buy Moovit.And Uber is pulling out of some Eats markets that cost more than they were worth.It's another huge week of earnings. We expect to see Shopify, Roku, Uber, Beyond Meat, PayPal, Pinterest, Dropbox, Square, Peloton and Lyft. Each company should provide us with notes on how a slice of the startup market is performing.Two funding rounds that caught our eye: Classplus's $9 million Series A as edtech booms, and Oxwash's $1.7 million deal to make on-demand laundry better for the planet.We wrapped asking that's going to come for companies that were still speculative businesses before the slowdown.

There was so much news this week in our main areas of focus -- startup funding rounds, new venture funds, that sort of thing -- that we had to exclude earnings from the main show! (But really, check it out, as it was a good time.)Sad, I know. Everyone surely noticed the loss, but we gathered once again on Friday afternoon to dig into the results all the same. A big thanks to Danny, Natasha and Chris for gathering 'round one more time to get through:\u00a0SaaS and enterprise earnings: We dug into Microsoft's results (TechCrunch coverage here), along with notes on quarterly results from Atlassian, Zendesk and ServiceNow. The gist is that big corp SaaS did fine in Q1, but there are varying levels of concern regarding the future.Subscription content: Spotify is doing fine and Netflix smashed it, according to Danny (TechCrunch coverage here, and here, respectively). Spotify also managed to eke out the world's funniest net income result, while Netflix shot forward like a hare from a trap. In short, we may be listening to fewer podcasts, but we sure as hell aren't getting off the couch.Advertising shops: While the advertising world melts down in spectacular fashion, tech shops that are ad powered did kinda OK. Facebook did what it always does, wowing with results and this time telling investors that April was looking better than March. Snap grew like hell, surprising investors, even if its overall cost structure is broken when compared to its revenue. Twitter was the miss of the bunch, struggling the most after telling investors it was still seeing COVID-19 issues in April. And, finally, Alphabet did Google things, so its stock went up, COVID-19 be damned.We avoided Tesla because who can be bothered, and managed the shortest note on Apple ever recorded on a business podcast. All that and we had some fun. Hugs from Equity; we'll be right back Monday morning!

Are you still standing? Did you make it? If you are upright and typing, congratulations, you're top-decile. If you're reading this from bed, that's fine too. We understand.The week was so busy that we actually ran a bit long this week, with lots left on the cutting room floor. So, with the full team aboard this week (Danny, Natasha, Chris, Alex), we got into the following:Niche raised $35 million in a Series C for its one-stop shop for college searchers. We talk about the edtech company's growth, confusing past, and how its B2B strategy is especially attractive in our new normal.Duolingo raised $10 million from General Atlantic, a move that was more opportunistic than out of necessity for new cash, the company claims. It also is based in Pittsburgh, which had the whole trio excited.Bonsai, which has a fantastic name, raised $1.5 million for 1-on-1 peer tutoring. We talk about the small round, and why conservatism is a good thing in this sector.To cap off our edtech coverage, we're starting to see sector momentum turn into actual dollars and deals.Figma raised $50 million at a reported $2 billion valuation, a small figure compared to its new pricetag. a16z led the new investment, which came just over a year following Figma's Series C. That prior round valued the firm at around $440 million (post-money), so Figma just glowed up by about 4.5x between rounds. Not bad.Catalyst raised $25 million Series B led Spark, not long after it closed a Series A worth $15 million that Accel had led. The customer success industry is growing in importance as startups and larger companies double-down on selling more to existing clients as net-new logos become harder to scrape together.Stash raised $112 million led by LendingTree, adding to the wave of savings-and-investing-focused services that are seeing a boom in demand (and, therefore, investor interest) as the economy falters.Particle Health raised money to make healthcare data easier to access, because sharing (in some cases) is caring.Plantible made us talk about aquafaba, the liquid found in chickpea cans, for way too long.A host of new funds were locked down this week, including OMERS Ventures putting together $750 million, Kickstart closing $110 million, and Zetta Venture Partners snagging $180 million for AI-focused investing.Then there was the bad news. Layoffs at Lyft, possible layoffs at Uber, and cuts at TripAdvisor. But, as Natasha reported, some folks are working to undo some of the damage that the layoffs are causing.We wrapped with a new Danny segment called \"Luckin Watch\" and will be back with a special ep on Saturday.
