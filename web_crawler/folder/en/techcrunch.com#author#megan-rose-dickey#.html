Watch Series 6 review"},"content":{"rendered":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">When it comes<\/span> to smartwatches, it\u2019s Apple against the world. It\u2019s not that there aren\u2019t plenty of other products to choose from \u2014 it\u2019s more that the company has just utterly dominated the space to such a point that any other device is relegated to the realm of \u201c<a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Watch alternatives.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The company has been successful in the space for the usual Apple reasons: premium hardware with deeply integrated software, third-party support, a large cross-device ecosystem play and, of, course, simplicity. Taken as a whole, the Watch just works, right out of the box.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Five years after launch, the line is fairly mature. As such, it\u2019s no surprise, really, that recent updates have largely amounted to refinements. As with most updates, the watch has gotten a processor boost up to the A14 processor, which the company claims is 20% faster than the last version.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>Perhaps the biggest hardware upgrade, however, is the addition of a blood oxygen sensor, an important piece in the company\u2019s quest to offer as complete an image of wearer health as is possible from the wrist.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Dkvjc9vzsO\"><p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/a-closer-look-at-the-new-apple-watches\/\">A closer look at the new Apple Watches<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;A closer look at the new Apple Watches&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/a-closer-look-at-the-new-apple-watches\/embed\/#?secret=Dkvjc9vzsO\" data-secret=\"Dkvjc9vzsO\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">I wrote<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/a-closer-look-at-the-new-apple-watches\/\"> a pretty lengthy piece<\/a> about the watch last week after wearing it for a few days. As I mentioned at the time, it was an odd kind of writeup, somewhere between hands-on and review. A week or so later, however, I\u2019m more comfortable calling this a review \u2014 even if not too many of my initial impressions have changed much in the past several days. After all, a mature product largely means most of the foundations remain unchanged.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Series 6 certainly looks the part. The Watch is tough to distinguish from other recent models \u2014 and for that matter, the new and significantly cheaper SE. The biggest visual change is the addition of new colors. In addition to the standard Gray and Gold, Apple\u2019s added new Blue and (Product)Red cases. The latter seems to be the more ostentatious of the pair. The company sent me a blue model, and honestly, it\u2019s a lot more subtle than I expected. It\u2019s more of a deep blue hue, really, that reads more as black a lot of the time.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s tough to imagine the product undergoing any sort of radical rethink of the device\u2019s design language at this point. We may see slight tweaks, including larger screen area going forward, but on the whole, Apple is very much committed to a form factor that has worked very well for it. I will probably always prefer Samsung\u2019s spinning bezel as a quick way to interface with the operating system, but the crown does the job well and scrolling through menus even feels a bit zippier this time, perhaps owing to that faster silicon.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"LWNvL7GOH3\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/you-can-now-return-apples-solo-loop-for-a-new-size-without-sending-back-the-watch\/\">You can now return Apple\u2019s Solo Loop for a new size, without sending back the Watch<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;You can now return Apple\u2019s Solo Loop for a new size, without sending back the Watch&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/you-can-now-return-apples-solo-loop-for-a-new-size-without-sending-back-the-watch\/embed\/#?secret=LWNvL7GOH3\" data-secret=\"LWNvL7GOH3\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">The new Solo Loop bands hit a bit of a hiccup out of the gate. I\u2019ve <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/you-can-now-return-apples-solo-loop-for-a-new-size-without-sending-back-the-watch\/\">detailed that a bit more here<\/a>, but I suspect that much of the problem came down to the difficulty of selling a specifically sized product during a strange period in history where in-person try-ons aren\u2019t really an option. In other words, just really bad timing on that front.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Personally, I quite like the braided model. I\u2019ve been using it as my day to day band. It\u2019s nice and blends in a lot better than the silicone model (I\u2019ve frankly never been much of a fan of Apple\u2019s silicone bands). But I do need to mention that Apple sent me a couple different sizes, which made it much easier to find the right fit. I recognize that. Especially when the braided Solo Loop costs a fairly exorbitant $99. The silicone version is significantly cheaper at $49, but either way, you\u2019re not getting off cheap there. So you definitely want to make sure you get the right fit.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052164\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052164\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2052164\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg 4000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052164\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This is doubly important given the fact that the Series 6\u2019s biggest new feature \u2014 blood oxygen monitoring \u2014 is highly dependent on you getting a good fit. The sensor utilizes a series of LEDs on the bottom of the watch to shine infrared and red light through the wearer\u2019s skin and into their blood vessels. The color of light that reflects back gives the watch a picture of the oxygen levels in the blood. The whole thing takes about 15 seconds, but only works if your fit is right. Even with the right Solo Loop on, I found myself having to retake it a few times when I first started wearing the watch.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Beyond the on-demand measurements, the watch will also take readings throughout the day and night, mapping these trends over time and incorporating them into sleep readings. The overall readings will give you a good picture of your numbers over time. Honestly though, I get the sense that this is really just the tip of the iceberg of future functionality.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For now, there\u2019s really no specific guidance \u2014 or context \u2014 given as far as what the numbers mean. Mine are generally between 90-100%. The Mayo Clinic tells me that\u2019s good, but obviously there are a lot of different factors and variations that can\u2019t properly be contextualized in a single paragraph &#8212; or on a watch. And Apple certainly doesn\u2019t want to be accused of attempting to diagnose a condition or offer specific medical guidance. That\u2019s going to be an increasingly difficult line for the company to walk as it gets more serious about these sorts of health tools.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If I had to venture a guess, I would say that the combination of sleep tracking in watchOS 7 and the on-board oximeter opens the door pretty nicely for something like sleep apnea tracking (again, more focused on alerts of irregularity versus diagnosis). We\u2019ve seen a small handful of companies like Withings tackle this, so it seems like a no-brainer for Apple, pending all of the regulatory requirements, et al. There are all sorts of other conditions that blood oxygen levels could potentially alert the wearer to, if not actually diagnose.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sleep was probably the biggest addition with the latest version of watchOS. This was probably the biggest blind spot for the line, compared to the competition. At the moment, the sleep tracking is, admittedly, still pretty basic. Like much of the rest of the on-board tracking, it\u2019s mostly compared with changes over time. The metrics include time in bed versus time asleep, as well as incorporating heart rate figures from the sensor\u2019s regular check-ins. More specific breakdowns, including deep versus light versus REM sleep haven\u2019t arrived yet, but will no doubt be coming sooner than later.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052166\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052166\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2052166 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg 4000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052166\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The door is also wide open for Apple to really get mindfulness right. The company has incorporated a mindfulness reminder for a while now, but it\u2019s easy to imagine how the addition of various sensors like heart rate could really improve the picture and find the company going all-in on meditation, et al. The company could partner with a big meditation name \u2014 or, more likely, disrupt things with its own offering. The forthcoming Fitness+ offering could play an important role in the growth of that category, as well.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The other issue that sleep brings to the front is battery life. I was banking on the company making big strides in the battery department \u2014 after all, a big part of sleep tracking is ensuring that you\u2019ve got enough charge to get through the night. Apple really only briefly touched on battery \u2014 though <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ifixit.com\/Teardown\/Apple+Watch+Series+6+Teardown\/136694?utm_content=buffer408ad&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\">a recent teardown<\/a> has revealed some smallish improvements on battery capacity (perhaps owing, in part, to space freed up by the dropping of Force Touch).<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The company has also made some improvements to energy efficiency, courtesy of the new silicon. Official literature puts it at a \u201cfull-day\u201d of<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>battery life, up to 18 hours. I found I was able to get through a full day with juice to spare. That\u2019s good, but the company\u2019s still got some ground to make up on that front, compared to, say, the Fitbit Sense, which is capable of getting nearly a week on a charge. I think at this point, it\u2019s fair to hold wearables to higher standards of battery life than, say, handsets. More than once, I\u2019ve found myself intermittently charging the device \u2014 20 minutes here and 20 minutes there \u2014 in order to have enough juice left by bedtime.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"GxSVdjFou2\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/29\/apple-began-work-on-the-watchs-hand-washing-feature-years-before-covid-19\/\">Apple began work on the Watch\u2019s handwashing feature years before COVID-19<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Apple began work on the Watch\u2019s handwashing feature years before COVID-19&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/29\/apple-began-work-on-the-watchs-hand-washing-feature-years-before-covid-19\/embed\/#?secret=GxSVdjFou2\" data-secret=\"GxSVdjFou2\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you can spare more time than that, you should be able to get up to 80% in an hour or 100% in an hour and a half, courtesy of faster wireless charging. All told, the company has been able to shave significant time off of charging \u2014 a definite plus now that you\u2019re not just leaving it overnight to charge. The latest version of watchOS will also handily let you know before if you don\u2019t have enough charge to make it through a full night.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Other updates include the addition of the always-on Altimeter, which, along with the brighter screen doesn\u2019t appear to have had a major impact on the battery. I\u2019ll be honest, being stuck in the city for these last several months hasn\u2019t given me much reason to need real-time elevation stats. Though the feature is a nice step toward taking the Watch a bit more seriously as an outdoor accessory in a realm that has largely been dominated by the likes of Garmin.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052167\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052167\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2052167\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg 4000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052167\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Of course, the company now has three watches on the market \u2014 including the Series 3, which just keeps on ticking, and the lower-cost SE. The latter retains the design of the Series 6, but drops a number of the key sensors, which honestly should be perfectly sufficient for many users \u2014 and $170 cheaper than the 6\u2019s $399 starting price ($499 with cellular).<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Taken as a whole, the Series 6 isn\u2019t a huge leap forward over the Series 5 \u2014 and not really worth the upgrade for those who already own that recent vintage.

company he runs with managing partner Mary Chan, and would be part of a consortium of investors, according to one unnamed source who requested anonymity because the deal had yet to be finalized. The deal could close as early as mid-October.<\/p>\n<p>TuSimple as well as Girsky declined to comment.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>It&#8217;s no secret that TuSimple has been seeking new capital.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/26\/tusimple-seeking-250-million-in-new-funding-to-scale-self-driving-trucks\/\">TechCrunch reported in June that TuSimple was in search of $250 million<\/a> in fresh capital from investors. The company hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to help it raise funds, according to multiple sources familiar with the effort. Since then, TuSimple, which already has backing from Sina, UPS and Tier 1 supplier Mando Corp., has announced a partnership with Navistar and most recently, the Traton Group.<\/p>\n<p>Girsky has most recently captured headlines because of Nikola, where he is now the executive chairman. Girsky took over as chairman in September after Nikola&#8217;s founder, Trevor Milton, stepped down following fallout from <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/nikola-disputes-fraud-claims-in-carefully-worded-rebuttal\/\">a scathing report<\/a> by short-seller firm Hindenburg Research that accused the company of fraud. VectoIQ Acquisition Corp., the SPAC that Girsky formed in 2018, announced a merger with Nikola in March, and Girsky oversaw its public listing this past June. He shepherded an introduction between Nikola and his former boss, GM CEO and chairwoman Mary Barra, according to one source familiar with the deal. By mid-September the automaker had announced a partnership valued at $2 billion with Nikola.<\/p>\n<p>Girsky may be Nikola&#8217;s new chairman and certainly has executive experience, but his focus in recent years has been as an advisor, investor and matchmaker. Girsky has long had an interest in mobility-related companies. His firm VectoIQ LLC specializes in advising companies and connecting large companies with startups working on autonomous vehicle technology, electrification, connected, cybersecurity and mobility-as-a-service.<\/p>\n<p>VectoIQ invested in lidar startup Luminar, which recently announced it was going public through a SPAC merger with Gores Metropoulos Inc., at a post-deal market valuation of $3.4 billion. Girsky also sat on the board of autonomous vehicle startup Drive.ai, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/06\/25\/self-driving-startup-drive-ai-is-closing-down\/\">which was acquired by Apple<\/a> as the company prepared to shut down.<\/p>\n<p>Girsky&#8217;s investment in TuSimple is separate from his interests in Nikola, which has yet to begin production of its Class 8 trucks, according to sources.<\/p>\n<p>TuSimple, which launched in 2015 and has operations in China, San Diego and Tucson, Arizona, is focused on the autonomous vehicle technology stack that will allow Class 8 trucks to operate without a human driver. TuSimple operates a fleet of 40 self-driving trucks in the U.S. that are used for testing and to carry freight between Arizona and Texas.<\/p>\n<p>TuSimple announced in July plans to develop and begin producing autonomous semi trucks by 2024 in partnership with Navistar. In September, Volkswagen AG&#8217;s heavy-truck business Traton Group said it took a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/23\/vws-traton-group-strikes-a-deal-with-tusimple-to-develop-autonomous-trucks\/\">minority stake in TuSimple<\/a> as part of an agreement between the two companies to develop self-driving trucks. Neither company disclosed the financial terms of the partnership or the percentage of the minority stake. Traton did make a direct capital investment into TuSimple, according to one unnamed source familiar with the deal. It&#8217;s unclear if it also included in-kind contributions.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Steve Girsky, the former GM vice chairman, consultant and investor whose special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merged with hydrogen electric startup Nikola this summer, is in talks to back self-driving trucks startup TuSimple, according to four people familiar with the deal.

href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/alexisohanian\">Alexis Ohanian<\/a>, the co-founder of Reddit and early-stage VC firm Initialized Capital, is raising a new fund, named 776, with a target of $150

The filing comes <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/26\/alexis-ohanian-reddit-co-founder-is-leaving-initialized-capital\/\">three months<\/a> after the entrepreneur left Initialized Capital and a month after The Information <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theinformation.com\/articles\/reddit-co-founder-alexis-ohanian-plots-new-early-stage-vc-fund\">first reported<\/a> on his plans. Ohanian declined to comment on details regarding the fund due to general solicitation restraints.<\/p>\n<p>Along the filing, the fund launched an intentionally cryptic new website:<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sevensevensix.com\/\"> sevensevensix.com<\/a>. It appears that the name of the fund is a reference to when the first Olympics were held, in 776 B.C.E.<\/p>\n<p>The website reads: &#8220;The first Olympics brought the best athletes from all over the known world to determine who was the greatest. The first competition was a 192m footrace; it was won by a cook from a nearby village. We\u2019re going back to that very first starting line.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>If I had to guess, I&#8217;d say Ohanian&#8217;s investing in pre-seed and seed startups.

twice as hard as others to succeed may be a depressing sentiment, but <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2015\/may\/11\/michelle-obama-i-was-knocked-back-by-race-perceptions\">it has been deeply ingrained<\/a> into the psyches of many African-Americans.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At TechCrunch Disrupt, several Black founders spoke about some of the burdens that come along with being a Black person in tech. Many of us are familiar with imposter syndrome, where one feels like they\u2019re a fraud and fear being \u201cfound out.\u201d <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But another idea that came up was representation syndrome.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Representation syndrome centers around this idea that because there are so few Black people in tech, being one of the only ones comes with this added pressure to be successful.

When racism is built into the technical framework of a company, it perpetuates a false idea that white people are superior to Black people.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Gig Work<\/h2>\n<hr \/>\n<h3><strong>The latest in the battle over Prop 22 and AB 5<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Two big things are happening pertaining to gig workers: Prop 22, the California bill backed by Uber, Lyft, Instacart and DoorDash that seeks to keep workers classified as independent contractors and lawsuits rooted in AB 5, the California law that went into effect earlier this year that lays out how to properly classify gig workers.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with Prop 22. <a href=\"https:\/\/escholarship.org\/uc\/item\/4cd2r446\">A new poll from the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies found<\/a> that it&#8217;s going to be a close election. In a survey of 5,900 likely voters, UC Berkeley&#8217;s IGS found that 39% of voters would vote yes on Prop 22 while 36% said they would vote no. The other 25% are undecided.<\/p>\n<p>As we mentioned last week, the Yes on 22 campaign has put in about $180 million into the campaign while the No on 22 side has put in about $4.6 million. Meanwhile, we&#8217;re seeing ads for Yes on 22 inside on-demand apps.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052176\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052176\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2052176\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/door-dash.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"653\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/door-dash.jpg 828w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/door-dash.jpg?resize=150,144 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/door-dash.jpg?resize=300,288 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/door-dash.jpg?resize=768,737 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/door-dash.jpg?resize=680,653 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/door-dash.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/door-dash.jpg?resize=50,48 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052176\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:\u00a0<\/strong>Screenshot of DoorDash app via TechCrunch<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>On the AB 5 side of things, Uber and Lyft are still in court <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/05\/uber-lyft-lawsuit-california-worker-misclassification\/\">after California\u00a0Attorney General Xavier Becerra, along with city attorneys from Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco sued the companies, alleging they are misclassifying their workers<\/a>. In the appeals court, which granted a stay on the preliminary injunction that would force Uber and Lyft to immediately reclassify their drivers, a number of amicus briefs have been filed.<\/p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nelp.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/People-v.-Uber-Lyft-Application-Amici-Curiae.pdf\">brief filed by the National Employment Law Group, the ACLU and other civil rights groups<\/a>, they say Uber and Lyft harm workers of color by classifying them as independent contractors:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Many poor workers of color and immigrants are stuck in a separate and unequal economy where they are underpaid, put in harm\u2019s way on the job, and left to fend for themselves without access to paid sick leave, unemployment insurance, workers\u2019 compensation, and other protections. By insisting that their drivers are not employees, Lyft and Uber further distance workers of colors from the bedrock workplace rights that provide real flexibility and economic security. Instead, their business models trap poor workers into intractable cycles of poverty and economic exclusion.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In the event Uber and Lyft are forced to reclassify their drivers, both Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and Lyft CEO Logan Green filed sworn statements earlier this month that confirmed they both have plans to comply with an order requiring them to reclassify their respective workforces.<\/p>\n<p>In Khosrowshahi&#8217;s statement, he simply said &#8220;Uber has developed implementation plans&#8221; to comply with an order within no more than 30 days. In Green&#8217;s statement, he said &#8220;such an implementation may include ceasing rideshare operations in all or some parts of California.&#8221;<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Don&#8217;t Miss<\/h2>\n<hr \/>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/21\/twitter-and-zoom-algorithmic-bias-issues\/\">Twitter and Zoom&#8217;s algorithmic bias issues &#8211; TechCrunch<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vice.com\/amp\/en_us\/article\/m7jz7b\/amazon-employee-warns-internal-groups-theyre-being-monitored-for-labor-organizing?__twitter_impression=true\">Amazon Employee Warns Internal Groups They\u2019re Being Monitored For Labor Organizing &#8211; Motherboard<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.geekwire.com\/2020\/bezos-academy-funded-jeff-bezos-2b-day-one-fund-launches-first-free-school-seattle-area\/\">Bezos Academy, funded by Jeff Bezos\u2019 $2B \u2018Day One Fund,\u2019 launches first free school in Seattle area &#8211; GeekWire<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/09\/25\/alphabet-settles-shareholder-lawsuit-.html?__source=twitter%7Cmain\">Alphabet settles shareholder lawsuit over alleged mishandling of sexual misconduct by execs &#8211; CNBC<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@emergentworks\/meet-the-formerly-incarcerated-software-engineers-who-built-a-no-police-alternative-to-911-5a5af163f8b2\">Meet the Formerly Incarcerated Software Engineers who Built a No-Police Alternative to 911<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have tips?

style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> use data to maximize their earnings. It works by requiring drivers to install an app that educates them about how the co-op collects and uses their data. In exchange, the app gives them insights about their real hourly wages after expenses and how those wages relate to different driving strategies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAt a community level, what we do is sort of align everybody&#8217;s interest so that as gig workers come into our co-op, as they generate data, the value of that data in the aggregate gets higher and higher,\u201d Witt said. \u201cThe dividends that we&#8217;re able to return back to drivers gets higher and also the kind of insights we&#8217;re able to give communities about work gets higher at the same time. So we kind of align all of our impact and mission goals. And our business model is through our co-op structure.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s not to say Driver\u2019s Seat does not create returns for its investors \u2014 investors are just one group of many that benefit from the company&#8217;s success. Witt said a desire for accountability made him decide to form a co-op.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf we are always accountable to our co-op members, and our co-op members are gig workers, then we&#8217;re going to know that we&#8217;re accountable to the right things,\u201d Witt said. \u201cNow, we have investor members, too. We&#8217;re accountable to them, too. But our structure means that the gig workers always have at least that 51%. [ \u2026 ] it&#8217;s certainly not the only way to build a business.

The issue is that Google has reportedly seen more posts being flagged for racism or abuse on its message boards. Some of these posts reportedly reinforce negative racial stereotypes, use harmful gendered phrases and insult Google employees based on their nationality. Here&#8217;s a snippet from Google&#8217;s internal blog, via CNBC:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cOur world is going to get more complicated as the year continues,\u201d the team stated in the internal blog. \u201cTensions continue specifically for our Black+ community with Black Lives Matter, and our Asian Googlers with coronavirus and China\/Hong Kong. All of this is compounded by the additional stress of working from home, social isolation, and caregiver responsibilities \u2014 to name a few. This new world creates urgency to keep work a welcoming place.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Yes, tough conversations are the theme of the year. But we also know Google has had issues with employees before.

The Wing, however, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/03\/17\/magazine\/the-wing.html\">went through some turmoil earlier this year<\/a>. Employees alleged mistreatment of Black and brown workers, which ultimately led to The Wing CEO Audrey Gelman&#8217;s resignation.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Well, you know, I&#8217;m not new to scandal, so there&#8217;s that,&#8221; Washington told me in response to a question about her reaction to the news. &#8220;I was and I am really deeply still inspired by the original vision of the company. And, I think like a lot of companies in this time, because of the several pandemics that we&#8217;re facing, whether it&#8217;s our awareness around racial injustice, or COVID, lots of people are in a moment of recalibration and self-reflection. So I think that there is incredible space to improve the dynamics. And as somebody who\u2019s an investor, as a woman of color, it\u2019s important to me that there is increased transparency and also accountability.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Over the past few months, Washington said her role as an investor has been \u201creally just supporting leadership in this transition,\u201d as well as expressing to those leaders a \u201cdeep desire\u201d for transparency and accountability.<\/p>\n<p><strong>On imposter syndrome and representation\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Also at Disrupt, my homegirl Kirsten Korosec led a wonderful <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/the-art-of-pivoting-with-phaedra-ellis-lamkins-and-jessica-matthews\/\">conversation with Phaedra Ellis-Lamkins of PromisePay and Jessica Matthews of Uncharted Power<\/a>, two Black female founders, about how they both successfully pivoted their companies while navigating the pressures that come with being an underrepresented founder in Silicon Valley.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/phaedra-ellis-lamkins\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"phaedra-ellis-lamkins\">Phaedra Ellis-Lamkins, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> founder and CEO at PromisePay:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>It feels like tech has failed so significantly in investing in people they don\u2019t know and missed out in growing companies because of that.

I also think that there&#8217;s so much emphasis around the toxicity in the technology world that a lot of really talented people believe it&#8217;s horrible, like believe that our world looks like Jim Crow South. And so therefore they shouldn&#8217;t even step any foot into it where like, I would challenge anyone trying to be successful in any industry to be able to avoid the types of problems that exists in the technology industry, if they come from an underrepresented background. <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">So I don&#8217;t think the environment&#8217;s significantly different in our world than other worlds. I think that the environment is hard. You know, there is bias if you&#8217;re underrepresented, across the board, no matter what industry you go to. So if you&#8217;re gonna be successful, you&#8217;re going to figure out a way to get around it.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s not to say you&#8217;ll have to figure it out on your own, Seibel said. He pointed to how there are people who are willing and able to help. That includes him and the many other Black founders present in Silicon Valley.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">&#8220;But if we somehow scare talented people away from this world, we won&#8217;t ever fix this world,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And we won&#8217;t ever, even more importantly than fixing this world, there&#8217;ll be huge swaths of the world that don&#8217;t have products and services that they deserve and that they need. And so I think we have to be careful to make sure we communicate that opportunities exist here. And that if you&#8217;re trying to be a high-powered lawyer, or if you&#8217;re trying to be, you know, a top banker, you&#8217;re gonna go through the same bullshit. Like, different industries, same bullshit. So if you&#8217;re trying to make an impact in the world, strap in. If you&#8217;re an underrepresented founder, you&#8217;re gonna have to deal with these issues, no matter where you do it.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Don&#8217;t miss<\/h2>\n<hr \/>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/15\/black-tech-pipeline-proves-the-pipeline-problem-isnt-real\/\">Black Tech Pipeline proves the \u2018pipeline problem\u2019 isn\u2019t real<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.educationdive.com\/news\/ibm-plans-100m-investment-in-hbcu-computing-program\/585374\/?utm_source=What+We%27re+Reading&amp;utm_campaign=26feb0fac7-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_09_18_04_58&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_a000bf097a-26feb0fac7-414321844\">IBM plans $100M investment in HBCU computing program<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/amazon-looks-more-contractors-grocery-003301659.html\">Amazon Looks to Use More Contractors for Grocery Delivery<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome back to Human Capital, where we unpack all-things diversity, inclusion and labor in tech.

With Darkstore, companies like <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/nike\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"nike\">Nike, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/adidas\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"adidas\">Adidas <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and Levis are able to offer same-day delivery to customers by storing their products inside Darkstore&#8217;s urban fulfillment centers. Currently, there are 550 Darkstores across 283 cities.<\/p>\n<p>With FastAF, consumers can now order directly from those Darkstores for same-day delivery. FastAF currently offers 1,200 items from 170 brands. Fast AF has partnered with <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/doordash\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"doordash\">DoorDash <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> to handle deliveries and a different company for returns. To return an item, customers can head into the FastAF app to request a return and then someone will come pick it up from you and take it back to the Darkstore fulfillment center.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2047095\" style=\"width: 465px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2047095\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical size-large wp-image-2047095\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/01-FastAF-Shop-Device.png?w=455\" alt=\"\" width=\"455\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/01-FastAF-Shop-Device.png 1676w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/01-FastAF-Shop-Device.png?resize=100,150 100w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/01-FastAF-Shop-Device.png?resize=201,300 201w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/01-FastAF-Shop-Device.png?resize=768,1148 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/01-FastAF-Shop-Device.png?resize=455,680 455w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/01-FastAF-Shop-Device.png?resize=1027,1536 1027w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/01-FastAF-Shop-Device.png?resize=1370,2048 1370w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/01-FastAF-Shop-Device.png?resize=33,50 33w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 455px) 100vw, 455px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2047095\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Darkstore<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>While all of the products available on FastAF will come from a Darkstore, not all of the retailers featured in FastAF are Darkstore customers.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We wanted to have a very good consumer experience out of the gate and use the demand to inform whether we should officially partner with those brands,&#8221; founder and CEO <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/lee-hnetinka-silicon-valley\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"lee-hnetinka-silicon-valley\">Lee Hnetinka <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> told TechCrunch. &#8220;The way we&#8217;ve chosen the categories and the products are really around what&#8217;s relevant in the times right now and what&#8217;s essential.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>FastAF features items like masks, hand sanitizer and soap, but also sneakers, sunglasses and other products. FastAF sells the products at MSRP but charges consumers fees related to delivery and fulfillment. Initially, FastAF will waive that delivery fee and is considering rolling out a free delivery option for orders over a certain amount.<\/p>\n<p>Hnetinka, you may remember, founded WunWun back in 2012 to provide on-demand delivery for stores and businesses. The company, which was a strong competitor to <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/postmates\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"postmates\">Postmates, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/05\/11\/alfred-purchases-wunwun-tech-employees-in-fire-sale\/\">ultimately shut down in 2015 and then sold its assets to Alfred<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;For WunWun, we were powering offline online,&#8221; Hnetinka told me. &#8220;We had runners that went to local stores and brought you things in as fast as 30 minutes. With Darkstore, we&#8217;re powering online offline. The next wave of that has always been a consumer facing app to enable all of the brands on these e-commerce companies to deliver products quickly. We felt there was no place to get the brands you have a high affinity towards from. These are the types of brands you weren&#8217;t able to get fast, previously.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>FastAF is currently only available in Los Angeles, but the plan is to launch in New York later this year. San Francisco is on the road map, but Hnetinka did not share an exact timeline.<\/p>\n<p>Darkstore, the company behind FastAF, has raised more than $30 million in funding. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/09\/19\/darkstore-raises-21-million-series-b-round\/\">Its most recent funding came last September<\/a> as part of a $21 million Series B round led by EQT Ventures.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Darkstore, the tech-driven fulfillment solution to enable e-commerce companies to offer same-day delivery, has just released a consumer-facing app called FastAF.

But it&#8217;s not impossible.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/phaedra-ellis-lamkins\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"phaedra-ellis-lamkins\">Phaedra Ellis-Lamkins, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> founder and CEO of <a href=\"https:\/\/home.promise-pay.com\/\">PromisePay<\/a>, and Jessica O. Matthews, founder and CEO of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.u-pwr.co\/\">Uncharted Power<\/a>, both have experience doing this. At TechCrunch Disrupt, they shed some light on their respective, yet somewhat similar, paths.<\/p>\n<p>PromisePay, formerly known as <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/promise\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"promise\">Promise, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> got its start as a bail reform startup that aimed to reduce the number of people held behind bars simply because they can&#8217;t pay bail. Now, it&#8217;s focused on helping people make payments for parking and traffic tickets, court fees and child support.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;We actually had this huge existential crisis,&#8221; Ellis-Lamkins said. &#8220;We at <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/promise\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"promise\">Promise <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> are focused on ending mass incarceration and on decreasing the number of people in jails. So we started to be very successful and we sold very well. And what we realized fundamentally is when we created efficiency, it made the systems more efficient at incarcerating people. It didn&#8217;t make them more efficient at what our wrong assumption had been, which is if the system is more efficient, it would decrease the number of people in the system. And so we made a decision that growth was not consistent with who we were as a company. So I went back to our investors, which is hard when you&#8217;re making money and said, this is not the path because I don&#8217;t think this is a long-term path.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>She told investors there are already people who sell their tech to law enforcement, but what Promise wants to do is liberate people. It became clear to her that she was selling to the wrong people when she was talking to a client who said the difference between them and her was that she cares about people in the criminal justice system and they don&#8217;t. Ellis-Lamkins told investors she was going to stop selling to prisons and jails, and offered to give investors their money back.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, she started looking at why people are ending up incarcerated.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And luckily, that spurred growth, but I&#8217;m just not going to be a company that grows on the backs of poor people and Black and brown people, because there is a better way,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But it was frightening in the moment to abandon a market in which we&#8217;re making money.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Thankfully, she said, not one of her investors had a problem with her decision.<\/p>\n<p><span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" data-sheets-userformat=\"{&quot;2&quot;:15043,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:1711393},&quot;9&quot;:0,&quot;10&quot;:1,&quot;12&quot;:0,&quot;14&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:13750995},&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;16&quot;:11}\">\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f627b7c5cfdcc2b0a2cddb2\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Matthews said she had a relatively similar experience with her company, Uncharted Power, which got its start as Uncharted Play. Her company&#8217;s first product was an energy-harnessing soccer ball that could power a lamp after just a few hours of playing with it. She later integrated that tech intro strollers to power cell phones.<\/p>\n<p>But after raising her Series A round for Uncharted Play, Matthews realized that her company needed to go all-in on infrastructure. She thought about the ultimate goal of her company, which is to get people the infrastructure they need in their lives. She just didn&#8217;t see a way of doing that with soccer balls.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;So we got good at making these things and pushing them and scaling them out, but when you have this balance of not just profit and impact but impact because you know that you&#8217;re a member of the group you&#8217;re trying to serve. For me, it was sitting down and saying &#8216;is this actually solving the problem even if it&#8217;s successful?&#8217; &#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Matthews said she realized it wasn&#8217;t. So that meant walking away from the products that were bringing in millions and had 64% gross profit margins, Matthews said.<\/p>\n<p>But it all paid off. Last year, Uncharted Power raised additional funding from an investor that validated her thesis for the future of power infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;That moment was huge for us,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>Matthews and Ellis-Lamkins also had some other gems worth sharing about imposter syndrome and measuring success. Here are some more highlights from the conversation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>On imposter syndrome and representation\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ellis-Lamkins:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>It feels like tech has failed so significantly in investing in people they don&#8217;t know and missed out in growing companies because of that. So I think our obligation is to help make sure that we are not the only ones.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Matthews:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s not imposter syndrome, it&#8217;s representation syndrome because I feel the exact same way. When we raised our Series A, the immediate thing I thought was, &#8216;Oh, man. I can not lose these people&#8217;s money.&#8217; This is huge and if we don&#8217;t work, it&#8217;s not even about us, it&#8217;s about every other person who looks like me.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>On measuring success<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ellis-Lamkins:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I think part of what we should measure is how does technology improve our society in general, a measurement of success. I do think that if we measure success, it should not just be, I could make a billion dollars or have a company that is valued at a billion dollars if the consequences are greater than the actual benefit and so I think that&#8217;s really important.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Matthews:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Let&#8217;s get rid of the term &#8220;social enterprise.&#8221; It&#8217;s bullshit. Enterprise is an enterprise. A problem&#8217;s a problem. Let&#8217;s create a value system based on the problems. There are some problems that are more important than others.

Using an algorithm built into the Blood Oxygen app, the watch then measures your blood oxygen level between 70% to 100%.\u00a0 The watch will also record background measurements while you sleep.<\/p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 663px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/content\/dam\/newsroom\/images\/product\/watch\/standard\/Apple_watch-series-6-Aluminum-blue-case-blood-oxygen-animation_09152020_inline.gif\/_jcr_content\/renditions\/large.gif\" alt=\"A GIF of the Blood Oxygen sensor and app on Apple Watch Series 6.\" width=\"653\" height=\"653\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: Apple<\/p><\/div><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Your blood oxygen level measures how much oxygen your red blood cells are carrying.

Tech Pipeline proves the &#8216;pipeline problem&#8217; isn&#8217;t real"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">The tech industry has become known as a place that is predominantly white and male. Contrary to the misguided popular belief, it&#8217;s not a pipeline problem as much as it&#8217;s a retention problem.<\/p>\n<p>Black Tech Pipeline aims to debunk that myth and help support Black technologists along their respective journeys. Black Tech Pipeline, founded by Pariss Athena, has three key offerings: a job board where anyone can pay to be featured, a recruitment and consulting service and connections to potential speakers for events.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The goal of Black Tech Pipeline is to bring exposure to the existing community of Black technologists,&#8221; Athena said. &#8220;We are focused on those who are here because we want to shine a light on the whole &#8216;pipeline problem&#8217; not being real. We&#8217;ve been in the industry. We exist in it. We&#8217;ve been here for years. We&#8217;re seniors, we&#8217;re mid-level, we&#8217;re a range. But we also want to create this ripple effect for those who are outside of the industry to show them you have a community of people who look like you and are here to support you through your journey.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Currently, there are nearly 700 Black technologists in the database. As of July, 8.66% of candidates had zero years of experience, 37.33% had one to two years&#8217; worth of experience, 27.33% had two to three years of experience, 22% had five to 10 years of experience and 10.5% had 10-plus years of experience.<\/p>\n<p>Companies featured on the job board are paying customers of Black Tech Pipeline. That means they get a customized landing page where they can describe the roles they have available, as well as detail their values, how the company thinks about diversity and inclusion, and more. These companies will also be featured in Black Tech Pipeline&#8217;s newsletter and social media platforms, which has a combined following of more than 40,000 people.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We want to give a very transparent view of what it means to work there as someone who is most likely going to be the minority in the workplace,&#8221; Athena said.<\/p>\n<p>Athena landed on the idea to create a database of Black technologists after she was laid off from her first job as a software engineer and became more active on Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When I got on, I noticed there was a really tiny community of Black technologists, which was interesting, because, at least out here in Boston &#8212; and I&#8217;m sure this is everywhere &#8212; but not only have I always been the only software engineer on the development team, but literally the only Black person in the entire company ever since I entered this industry,&#8221; Athena said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;So because I rarely saw people who look like me, I just figured we weren&#8217;t really in this industry, so when I saw that we were a few of us, I was like, &#8216;Oh, cool, I wonder how many more of us are out there?&#8217; And I had put out a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ParissAthena\/status\/1068873547005812737\">tweet asking what does Black Twitter in tech look like<\/a>? And that tweet, unexpectedly, went semi-viral and lots of Black technologists from all over the world posted themselves into the tweet, and it created this super long thread of their pictures and captioning what they do in the industry. And overnight, it really formed this movement and community of Black tech Twitter.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That same week, employers began reaching out to Athena, asking her to help them recruit Black people, she said. Despite not having any recruiting experience, Athena agreed to help. She developed a talent database in order to connect candidates with employers, as well as an accompanying application that automatically filters into the database.<\/p>\n<p>In its earlier days, Athena said she noticed that while many of the candidates were being hired, a lot of them weren\u2019t being retained.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;So there was just this retention problem,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And as someone who has always been the only Black person in predominantly white spaces, I knew what was going on.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2045225\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2045225\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2045225\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/IVRDw28.jpg?w=510\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/IVRDw28.jpg 900w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/IVRDw28.jpg?resize=113,150 113w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/IVRDw28.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/IVRDw28.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/IVRDw28.jpg?resize=510,680 510w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/IVRDw28.jpg?resize=38,50 38w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2045225\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pariss Athena, founder of Black Tech Pipeline. Photo courtesy of Athena.<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s what led Athena to create a consultant package and start charging companies. Anytime a candidate would get hired through her efforts, she would conduct biweekly check-ins during the first 90 days to see how they&#8217;re doing.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;That was my way of ensuring that I didn&#8217;t send them somewhere harmful,&#8221; Athena said. &#8220;And with their consent and safety in mind, I would relay the feedback that they gave me to the employer.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The goal with that is to help employers improve their work culture, as well as the systems and processes that have bias baked into them. Initially, Athena was doing this for free and operating simply out of her Twitter direct messages. Athena has since started charging companies for these services as part of her company, Black Tech Pipeline.<\/p>\n<p>Despite all the effort Athena has put into Black Tech Pipeline, this is not yet her full-time job, but she wants it to be. Ideally, she would be focused more on the consultation piece.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I really love the fact that I get to be this almost external HR, but for the candidate and not for the company,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So, I&#8217;m not here to protect the company and make sure it looks good no matter how much harm they&#8217;re doing. I&#8217;m here to make sure this person is having a good experience, and if not, I&#8217;m going to hold you accountable and we&#8217;re going to work on it. So that&#8217;s really what I want to do &#8212; make change and hold people to their word. I don&#8217;t want to work with anyone that&#8217;s going to be performative.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Of the 12 companies she&#8217;s worked with so far, there have been nine hires. Technically, there have been more, but Athena said she doesn&#8217;t count the ones where people have been hired but haven&#8217;t stayed for very long. Part of that retention problem, she said, reflects a couple of issues she&#8217;s had with larger companies.<\/p>\n<p>One of those issues is there being a disconnect between the folks at the company who really do want to implement change and the higher-ups who feel less inclined to do so, Athena said. Another one is that some folks who have been hired have experienced microaggressions that made them want to leave.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And so when those things happen, I&#8217;m reporting it to the manager but they don&#8217;t know how to move forward with it,&#8221; Athena said. &#8220;They&#8217;ll say it&#8217;s not substantial enough or say it was coincidental. When I cannot get through to employers like that, I finish out my contract with them by doing the check-ins and reporting feedback, but I don&#8217;t dive in to look at their current processes and see where they can improve. I don&#8217;t do that anymore for those types of employers. So I just finish out the contract and move on.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The tech industry has become known as a place that is predominantly white and male.

Now, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en_us\/article\/wxqawn\/labor-board-finds-merit-that-kickstarter-illegally-fired-union-organizer?\">the National Labor Board has found merit that Kickstarter unlawfully fired <\/a>a union organizer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kickstarter&#8217;s successful organizing made it become the first major tech company in the U.S. to unionize and join OPEIU Local 153. <\/span>Then, one month later, collaborative coding platform <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/13\/online-code-collaboration-tool-glitch-votes-to-unionize\/\">Glitch voted to unionize with Code-CWA<\/a>.*<\/p>\n<p>Now, at least 10 tech companies are actively trying to unionize, according to Grace Reckers, the lead northeast union organizer of OPEIU, told TechCrunch. Part of what&#8217;s driving this increased interest in unions is the abuse of data and privacy by tech giants.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Employees are seeing that they don&#8217;t actually have control of how the products they make are being used,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Even though most of the messaging in Silicon Valley is about creating a better world for us, making our lives easier and innovating, it also moves under the philosophy of move fast and break things.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And &#8220;breaking things&#8221; can lead to things like employee layoffs, misuse of data or separation of families, Reckers said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Workers want control over how products are being created, and control of how those tools are being used,&#8221; she said. &#8220;People are realizing it&#8217;s not just about their immediate workplaces but also their impacts on local communities or global communities.&#8221;<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Stay Woke<\/b><\/h2>\n<hr \/>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/09\/instagram-is-building-a-product-equity-team-and-hiring-a-director-of-diversity-and-inclusion\/\">Instagram announced<\/a> a new Equity team <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to work on \u201cbetter understanding and addressing bias in our product development\u201d the experiences people have on Instagram, Adam Mosseri, Instagram lead, wrote. Part of the responsibilities of that team include creating fair and equitable products, as well as ensuring algorithmic fairness. According to a job posting for an equity and inclusion product manager, the team will be fully focused on equity and inclusion, and &#8220;creating the most equitable experience for our global communities.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Instagram desperately needs an effective team in this area. In June, some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/media\/2020\/jun\/10\/online-influencers-under-fire-blacking-up-support-blm-instagram\">Instagram influencers posted photos of themselves in Blackface<\/a> in a misguided attempt to support the Black Lives Matter movement. Meanwhile, Black people have reported harassment on the platform and fears of being shadowbanned.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram is also looking to hire its own diversity lead. According to the job posting, the director of diversity and inclusion will be responsible for increasing and retaining people from diverse backgrounds, among other things. Facebook has had a head of diversity in place since 2013, but given how big of a company Facebook has become, it seems worthwhile to have a diversity leader specifically focused on Instagram.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Don&#8217;t Miss<\/h2>\n<hr \/>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en_us\/article\/g5p9nb\/employees-of-social-change-nonprofit-stage-walkout-to-protest-racial-abuse\">Employees of Social Change Nonprofit Stage Walkout to Protest &#8216;Racial Abuse&#8217;<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en_us\/article\/xg839d\/hacks-bots-and-the-pandemic-have-fueled-a-racist-class-war-on-instacart?\">Instacart Hacks and Bots Have Fueled a Racist Class War Among Shoppers<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en_us\/article\/qj49jv\/targets-delivery-app-workers-to-be-paid-by-a-blackbox-algorithm-nationwide\">Target&#8217;s Delivery App Workers to Be Paid by a Blackbox Algorithm Nationwide<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em>*Disclosure: My partner works at Glitch.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome back to Human Capital, where we unpack the latest in tech labor and diversity and inclusion.

Facebook has had a head of diversity in place since 2013, but given how big of a company Facebook has become, it seems worthwhile to have a diversity leader specifically focused on Instagram.<\/p>\n<p>Instagram says it has also updated its policies around implicit hate speech, such as depictions of blackface or stereotypes about Jewish people. Instagram says it will also now disable accounts that make serious rape threats, instead of just removing the content.<\/p>\n<p>On the verification front, Instagram has also expanded its criteria to include more Black, LGBTQ+ and Latinx media. Instagram has also stopped automatically prioritizing verification for accounts with high followings.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Instagram announced some changes it&#8217;s making that are geared toward advancing equity within its workplace.

where we unpack the latest in tech labor, and diversity, equity and inclusion. Human Capital will soon be available as a newsletter. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/newsletters\">Sign up here<\/a> so you don&#8217;t miss it when it drops!<\/p>\n<p>This week, we&#8217;re looking at Pinterest&#8217;s newest edition to its DEI team, a California bill that seeks to increase racial diversity at the board level, Amazon&#8217;s messy week and a court decision forcing Apple to pay its workers for time spent in security screenings.<\/p>\n<p>But first, a quick history of Labor Day, which was first celebrated on September 5, 1882 in New York City following a proposal by the Central Labor Union in the city. On that day, between 10,000 to 20,000 workers took unpaid time off to march from NYC&#8217;s city hall to Union Square in what became the first Labor Day parade.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>In the time between the first Labor Day parade and when it became a federal holiday in 1894, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.history.com\/news\/labor-day-pullman-railway-strike-origins\">railroad workers went on strike<\/a> after George Pullman laid off hundreds of employees and cut wages by 30 percent for those who remained. In May 1894, workers walked out and their union, the American Railway Union, called for a boycott on Pullman train cars. Shortly after, the group representing Chicago&#8217;s railroad companies called on the federal government to help shut down the strike. Once federal troops arrived in Chicago, the strike turned deadly as the National Guard killed as many as 30 people.<\/p>\n<p>The troops left in July and, that same month, Labor Day became a national holiday to be celebrated the first Monday in September every year. The strike ended in early August. It&#8217;s a complicated history, but it shows labor struggles have been at the heart of American capitalism since the country&#8217;s inception (slavery). Now, more than 100 years after the first Labor Day, workers are still fighting for better protections, pay and working conditions.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Stay Woke<\/h2>\n<hr \/>\n<h3><b>Pinterest brings on new head of inclusion and diversity<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Pinterest grapples with some <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/14\/pinterest-employees-are-walking-out-today-in-light-of-discrimination-allegations\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">internal unrest<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over claims of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ifeomaozoma\/status\/1272546213322080258\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">racial<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/11\/former-coo-sues-pinterest-accusing-it-of-gender-discrimination-retaliation-and-wrongful-termination\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gender discrimination<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.pinterest.com\/en\/post\/tyi-mccray-joins-pinterest-as-global-head-of-inclusion-and-diversity\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">company has brought on a new head of inclusion and diversity<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Its last head of diversity, Candice Morgan, quietly left earlier this year for venture firm GV.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tyi McCray, the company\u2019s new global head of inclusion and diversity, previously worked at Airbnb where she held a few different roles. She began as Airbnb\u2019s interim director of Diversity and Belonging before becoming a diversity strategy lead and ultimately, a government affairs and strategic partnerships lead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McCray will report directly to Pinterest CEO Ben Silbermann. This marks the first time Pinterest is having a head of diversity report directly to the CEO, rather into HR. Facebook did something similar earlier this year when it began having its chief diversity officer, Maxine Williams, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/11\/facebook-chief-diversity-officer-report-sheryl-sandberg-juneteenth\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">report directly to Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But Facebook still fell short of having Williams report directly to CEO Mark Zuckerberg.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diversity advocates for years have been calling for heads of diversity to report directly to the CEO. Many companies, however, have yet to do that. More often, tech companies have their heads of diversity report into the head of HR.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>California may soon require more diversity at the board level<\/h3>\n<p>The tech industry has been under scrutiny for its lack of diversity for years now. Some progress has been made in terms of representation of Black and brown folks within companies, but not always at the leadership level. <a href=\"https:\/\/leginfo.legislature.ca.gov\/faces\/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB979\">AB979<\/a>, which is heading to California Governor Gavin Newsom&#8217;s desk, aims to accelerate diversity at the board level.<\/p>\n<p>The bill would require public companies based in California to have at least one board member from an underrepresented group. If signed into law, the bill would also require companies with between four to nine directors to have at least two board members be from an underrepresented group. For boards with nine or more directors, the bill would require a minimum of three people from an underrepresented group.<\/p>\n<p>The bill defines an individual from an underrepresented community as someone who self-identifies as Black, Latinx, Asian, Pacific Islander, Indigenous and\/or as gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender.<\/p>\n<p>This bill seeks to build on top of preexisting law that went into effect in 2018 that mandated publicly held corporations based in California would have a minimum of one female director on its board by the end of 2019. By the end of 2021, companies with five or more directors must have a minimum of two female board members while companies with six or more directors must have at least three female board members.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">The 99%<\/h2>\n<hr \/>\n<h3><b>Amazon is a mess<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amazon found itself under scrutiny again over its labor practices. It started when <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jfslowik\/status\/1300756214574276610\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reports surfaced<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that Amazon was looking to hire an intelligence analyst. Specifically, Amazon in a job posting said it was seeking someone who would inform higher-ups and attorneys \u201con sensitive topics that are highly confidential, including labor organizing threats against the company.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amazon swiftly took down that job post, saying it was \u201cnot an accurate description of the role &#8211; it was made in error and has since been corrected,\u201d Amazon spokesperson Maria Boschetti said in a statement to TechCrunch. While Amazon did not give a specific revised description, the company said the role is meant to support its team of analysts that focus on external events, like weather, large community gatherings or other events that have the potential to disrupt traffic or affect the safety and security of its buildings and the people who work at those buildings.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, that same day, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en_us\/article\/3azegw\/amazon-is-spying-on-its-workers-in-closed-facebook-groups-internal-reports-show\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vice reported Amazon had been spying on workers for years<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to monitor for any potential strikes or protests. Amazon has since said it will stop using its social media monitoring tool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe have a variety of ways to gather driver feedback and we have teams who work every day to ensure we\u2019re advocating to improve the driver experience, particularly through hearing from drivers directly,\u201d Boschetti said in a statement. \u201cUpon being notified, we discovered one group within our delivery team that was aggregating information from closed groups. While they were trying to support drivers, that approach doesn\u2019t meet our standards, and they are no longer doing this as we have other ways for drivers to give us their feedback.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amazon did not comment on how long it had been monitoring closed Facebook groups.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-09-01\/amazon-drivers-are-hanging-smartphones-in-trees-to-get-more-work?sref=gni836kR\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bloomberg reported<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> some Amazon Flex drivers have resorted to hanging smartphones in trees in order to get more work in Chicago.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Apple owes its retail workers backpay for time spent in security screenings<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apple has had intense security practices for some time now. Part of that has meant requiring workers to go through security screenings before leaving the store at the end of their shifts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The case dates back all the way to 2015, when a group of Apple retail workers in California filed a class-action suit arguing they should be paid while waiting for their bags to be searched.<\/p>\n<p>From the ruling:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Employees estimate that the time spent waiting for and undergoing an exit search pursuant to the Policy typically ranges from five to twenty minutes, depending on the manager or security guard\u2019s availability. Some employees reported waiting up to forty-five minutes to undergo an exit search. Employees receive no compensation for the time spent waiting for and undergoing exit searches, because they must clock out before undergoing a search pursuant to the<br \/>\nPolicy.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In February, CA Supreme Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. But a US District judge later granted Apple&#8217;s request for a summary judgment since some workers part of the class were not required to go through searches since they didn&#8217;t bring bags or devices to work. This week, however, an appeals court ruled that it wasn&#8217;t relevant if workers did or did not bring their devices or bags to work. Now, Apple must pay more than 12,000 class members for time spent waiting for security screenings.<\/p>\n<p>Apple did not respond for our request for comment.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Don\u2019t Miss<\/b><\/h3>\n<hr \/>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/carta-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-denies-claims-1119b9a9-7466-4d41-a221-3e1c84d3f509.html\">Carta replies to gender discrimination lawsuit, denies all claims<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/news.crunchbase.com\/news\/oakland-black-business-fund-launches-investment-platform-for-black-owned-businesses\/\">Oakland Black Business Fund Launches Investment Platform For Black-Owned Businesses<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/09\/01\/leaked-letter-google-recruiting-group-wants-clearer-diversity-goals.html\">Google recruiting group warns minority turnover will continue without clearer diversity goals<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/03\/building-paths-to-funding-for-black-female-founders\/\">Building paths to funding for Black female founders<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/31\/exit-to-community\/\">There\u2019s a growing movement where startup founders look to exit to community<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en_us\/article\/v7g8g8\/nigerian-ride-hail-drivers-are-striking-over-regulations-that-leave-them-in-the-cold\">Nigerian Ride-Hail Drivers Are Striking Over Regulations That Leave Them in the Cold<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Happy Labor Day and welcome back to Human Capital, where we unpack the latest in tech labor, and diversity, equity and inclusion.

Meanwhile, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/20\/why-micromobility-is-poised-to-come-out-of-the-pandemic-stronger-than-before\/\">some industry analysts have pointed to micromobility<\/a> as a savior for cities where public transit is suffering as a result of low ridership.<\/p>\n<p>Although there have been many layoffs and consolidation across the market, micromobility as a technological tool may be poised to come out of this year stronger than before. And despite the over-saturation of companies in the micromobility market, there are still opportunities for new players.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ll be exploring at <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/tc-sessions-mobility-2020?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2020&amp;utm_content=micromobility&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=micromobility&amp;display=\">TC Sessions: Mobility<\/a> with Tortoise co-founder Dmitry Shevelenko, Elemental Excelerator director of Innovation, Mobility, Danielle Harris and Superpedestrian VP of Strategy and Policy, Avra van der Zee.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><strong>Tortoise co-founder and president <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/dmitry-shevelenko\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"dmitry-shevelenko\">Dmitry Shevelenko\u00a0<\/strong><\/p> <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>\n<p>Given the volume of micromobility operators in the space today, Tortoise aims to make it easier for these companies to more strategically deploy their respective vehicles and reposition them when needed. Using autonomous technology in tandem with remote human intervention, Tortoise\u2019s software enables operators to remotely relocate their scooters and bikes to places where riders need them, or, where operators need them to be recharged.<\/p>\n<p>On an empty sidewalk, Tortoise may employ autonomous technologies, while it may rely on humans to remotely control the vehicle on a highly trafficked city block. Shevelenko will walk us through his company&#8217;s approach to building an operating system for micromobility providers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Excelerator director of Innovation, Mobility, Danielle Harris<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Given the challenges the COVID-19 pandemic has created in cities, there is room for electric bikes and scooters to provide alternative transportation options to cities. Additionally, there is growing interest in charging stations as well as the direct-to-consumer market, as society still grapples with ways to live among a deadly virus.<\/p>\n<p>Harris, who used to work as an innovation strategist for San Francisco&#8217;s Municipal Transportation Agency&#8217;s Office of Innovation, has a a plethora of knowledge about how startups can best work with cities and provide them with relevant and effective mobility solutions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Superpedestrian VP of Strategy and Policy, Avra van der Zee<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Superpedestrian first came on the scene with its vehicle diagnostics platform for shared electric scooters.

Y Combinator, however, did not break out stats for Black female founders.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And for me, it was super important to give them the experience to be in a space where they felt comfortable talking to people in a space where they can simply ask questions and not feel any type of way about it. And I just noticed I actually hadn&#8217;t seen that.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>When Fines would come home to Oakland after a YC event, there would be a lot of Black women around, she said. But for the Black female founders elsewhere, there just wasn&#8217;t a space for them to go where they could &#8220;feel comfortable asking the question they needed the answer to without feeling like they&#8217;re less than,&#8221; Fines said.<\/p>\n<p>That was her passion, Fines said. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/meghalexander\">Megan Holston-Alexander<\/a> of Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s Cultural Leadership Fund and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/12\/zume-co-founder-goes-from-pizza-to-climate-friendly-food-with-2-7-million-in-funding\/\">Planet FWD founder Julia Collins<\/a> were already volunteering at All Raise as Fines joined All Raise from YC.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;So it was one of those things where we just kind of put all of our heads together,&#8221; Fines said. &#8220;We wanted to make sure that we could do something that&#8217;d be super tactical and useful, but also make it not just an event. It&#8217;s an experience and we want to make sure that Black women are just getting the help they need all year-round.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the event, a Slack group formed this year to help determine the next steps for the community. Some of the ideas floating around right now are founder bootcamps, adding more speakers to the event, facilitating better networking and workshops. But it&#8217;s ultimately up to the group&#8217;s collective conscience.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m planning on polling them to find out exactly what the need is right now,&#8221; Fines said. &#8220;And then it just changes every day, like depending on what&#8217;s going on in the world. It&#8217;s one of those things where we just want to make sure that what we&#8217;re doing for them is super useful.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, Fines envisions hosting smaller classes on fundraising and deck building.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one of those things that people need a lot of assistance with,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But they also need someone that&#8217;s going to be truthful and honest with them about it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Seibel touched on that element of honesty in his chat with Collins during the event. He told a story about what it was like when he was fundraising for his startup.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I started doing startups, it was 2006 and there weren\u2019t many people who looked like any of us that were doing startups,\u201d he told the audience. \u201cI think what you would\u2019ve expected was overt discrimination but actually I got something else, which was no feedback.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He went on to say that people were afraid to be critical of him, for fear of being perceived a certain way.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPeople were afraid of being critical with me,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s partly why Seibel says he\u2019s become the type of person who will tell founders what everyone is thinking.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAgree with it or disagree with it, I want you to have a good mental model of what people are thinking and not saying,\u201d Seibel said.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout the day, there were 120 founders and 40 VCs at the event. The next step for Fines is to get their consent to give their contact info to venture capitalists.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I noticed a lot of VCs definitely want to continue the conversations but I want to make sure that all of the founders feel comfortable with that as well,&#8221; Fines said.<\/p>\n<p>Next week, Fines plans to send out the poll to founders to better understand their needs and where to take the initiative from here.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I want to make sure that we still keep our community tight knit,&#8221; Fines said. &#8220;I want them to continue to push and keep talking about it because this is not something that&#8217;s going to be an easy breezy thing. It&#8217;s going to be ongoing and forever.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Amid a racial justice reckoning following countless events of police brutality (justice for Breonna Taylor), it&#8217;s high time companies and investors in the tech industry do more than just say &#8220;Black Lives Matter,&#8221; but show that Black lives matter.

$22 million Series B round led by Stripes, with participation from Workday Ventures and others.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/legion.co\/\">Legion<\/a> is designed to help employers better manage their hourly workforces by automating certain decisions, like how much labor to deploy to meet the needs of the company and when to schedule workers. Taking into account demand forecasting, labor optimization and the preferences of employees, Legion then generates a schedule that &#8220;ensures employees are able to work when they prefer to work,&#8221; Legion CEO Sanish Mondkar told TechCrunch. &#8220;These are all important problems to solve in the overall puzzle of labor management.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Legion sells its platform to mid-sized to larger enterprise customers, including SoulCycle, Philz and Dollar General. Its largest customer has more than 100,000 employees on the platform. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for something like Legion, Mondkar said.

Legion&#8217;s algorithm then tries to match the preferences of employees with the needs of the business.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Conventional wisdom in this industry for a long period of time has been, &#8216;If I optimize labor more, I can squeeze more out of them and get them to optimize labor more,&#8217; &#8221; Mondkar said. &#8220;Things like flexibility almost seem contrary to that goal. People think if they let employees pick flexible hours, that will counter their goal of getting more labor efficiency. Our goal is to prove that&#8217;s not right and that you can ensure both of them thrive simultaneously.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Legion says its customers can expect at least a 10x return on investment, which can come in the form of efficient labor deployment, optimized labor and employee retention. For many Legion customers, Mondkar said the company has been able to reduce churn by 30-50%.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The addressable market for what we do is very large,&#8221; Mondkar said. &#8220;It&#8217;s about how do you manage labor fundamentally in a way that provides you business efficiency but also enables happy employees.

Exit to Community (E2C), a collaborative working project led by the University of Colorado Boulder&#8217;s Media Enterprise Design Lab and Zebras Unite, <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">explores ways to help startups transition investor-owned to community ownership, which could include users, customers, workers or some combination of all stakeholders.\u00a0<\/span>Today, the group released a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.colorado.edu\/lab\/medlab\/2020\/08\/31\/exit-community-community-primer\">digital and physical zine<\/a> designed to serve as an introduction to Exit to Community.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe purpose of the zine is to provide an initial roadmap to all of the aspects of the conversation that need to happen so we can save founders pain in recognizing and validating they\u2019re in the wrong fit and we need to co-create what does fit,\u201d Zebras Unite co-founder and zine co-author Mara Zepeda told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s not a silver bullet. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s this other perfect thing that everyone needs to do. I describe it as running a Cambrian explosion of experiments in order to figure out what this future is. It\u2019s not just one thing. That\u2019s how what we\u2019re doing is really different. Sometimes there are these niche products or movements that pop up and say, \u201cthis is the answer. There isn\u2019t one answer for this moment.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>These alternative exit models also have the potential to open the door for founders in other markets, E2C co-organizer Nathan Schneider told TechCrunch. He pointed to <a href=\"https:\/\/tiphub.vc\/\">tiphub<\/a>, a company focused on Africa and the African Diaspora, that had been looking for alternative ways to support founders, given there isn&#8217;t a huge mergers and acquisitions market in Africa.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Because of the infrastructure that exists in the financial market, we don&#8217;t have the same set of realities that a very active VC industry does in Europe or the U.S.,&#8221; tiphub partner Chika Umeadi told TechCrunch. &#8220;There&#8217;s just not as much private equity activity or M&amp;A activity. We believe we have a strong hypothesis for how we can manufacture companies quickly, but we still need to build the other side of the market. There are companies that are valuable, but we now have to think about alternative methods of exiting.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Already, there are a handful of examples out there of what exiting to community can look like. Buffer, a social media management platform, bought out its investors in 2018 because it became &#8220;clear that Buffer had become less of a fit for VC funding,&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/buffer.com\/resources\/buying-out-investors\/\">Buffer CEO and co-founder Joel Gascoigne wrote in a blog post at the time.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Then, in 2019, SEO and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/12\/12\/condutor-wework-buyout\/\">Conductor bought back its content marketing company from WeWork<\/a>. Now, the company is majority employee-owned.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a dream that we always had that we would own the company and we gave a huge amount of ownership to all the people and now the company is almost entirely employee-owned,&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/13\/how-to-buy-back-your-startup-from-a-tech-giant-like-wework\/\">Conductor CEO Seth Besmertnik told me earlier this year<\/a>. &#8220;And now we have everything we want to go and make our mission a reality.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Outside of the tech industry, E2C points to Organically Grown Company, an organic produce distributor based in Oregon that transitioned from an employee- and grocer-owned operation into a community-owned one.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;These types of glimpses suggest that it&#8217;s possible,&#8221; Schneider said.<\/p>\n<p>For investors, while IPOs and acquisitions can elicit high returns, not all of the startups in their portfolios will be candidates.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Their current exit options limit what kind of returns and outcomes they can see for their portfolio companies,&#8221; Schneider said. &#8220;If a startup ends up not being a candidate for an IPO or acquisition, E2C can still help them get their money back, or get a decent return. There&#8217;s also a class of investors trying to thread the needle of financial return with social return, and are looking for models that can help facilitate that.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Beyond the zine, the next step is to create a peer learning cohort of founders who are exploring some of these options. Down the road, the hope is to create standard documents for startups that make it easy for founders to pursue these alternative paths.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Traditional roadmaps for startups center around this idea of the exit.

This week, we&#8217;re looking at the launch of the Diversity Riders initiative in venture capital and how it can go further, Instacart&#8217;s labor practices and some alternative, more inclusive approaches to running a startup. Also, Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel recently shared a compelling anecdote about his experience as a Black founder raising money back in 2016.<\/p>\n<p>Justice for Jacob Blake and Breonna Taylor.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Stay Woke<\/b><\/h2>\n<hr \/>\n<h3><b>Diversity Riders commitment needs to go further<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier this week, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.actoneventures.com\/diversity-rider\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Act One Ventures launched a new diversity and inclusion initiative called The Diversity Term Sheet Rider for Representation at the Cap Table<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The purpose of the Diversity Rider is to increase the number of Black and other underrepresented investors in deals by making them co-investors.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Already, firms like Greycroft Partners, First Round Capital, Maveron, Fifth Wall, Plexo Capital and Precursor Ventures have committed to it. What that means is firms will include boilerplate language in their standard term sheets:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to advance diversity efforts in the venture capital industry, the Company and the lead investor, [Fund Name], will make commercial best efforts to offer and make every attempt to include as a co-investor in the financing at least one Black [or other underrepresented group including, but not limited to LatinX, women, LGBTQ+] check writer (DCWs), and to allocate a minimum of [X]% or [X] $&#8217;s of the total round for such co-investor.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is certainly a good step on the road to creating additional wealth opportunities for Black, Latinx and Indigenous people, as well folks from other underrepresented groups in tech. However, a stronger step would be to remove the parts about \u201cbest efforts\u201d and \u201cmake every attempt\u201d because, as it\u2019s currently written, the commitment hedges on rather subjective conditions.

Cruise also began focusing more on <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/21\/cruise-doubles-down-on-hardware\/\">hardware earlier this year.<\/a> That all came after Cruise <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/24\/cruise-will-launch-a-commercial-robotaxi-service-in-san-francisco-but-not-in-2019\/\">had already scrapped its plans to launch a robotaxi service in 2019<\/a>. In the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, Cruise laid off 8% of its workforce in May in an attempt to cut costs. As part of the restructuring, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/14\/cruise-lays-off-8-of-workforce-to-cut-costs-and-put-resources-towards-engineering\/\">Cruise said it would double down on its engineering efforts<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Cruise still has its eyes set on public deployment, which is where the expertise of Raman comes in. It&#8217;s her job to help Cruise navigate the murky regulatory waters of autonomous vehicles.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/nuro-2\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"nuro-2\">Nuro <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Chief Legal &amp; Policy Officer David Estrada\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Nuro, an autonomous delivery startup, takes a slightly different approach to autonomous vehicles. Instead of transporting people, Nuro transports goods. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/07\/nuro-gets-ok-to-test-its-driverless-delivery-vehicles-on-california-public-roads\/\">In April<\/a>, Nuro received a permit to begin driverless testing in California. The startup, which raised $940 million from SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund last year, aims to deliver groceries and other goods to customers at scale.<\/p>\n<p>Estrada, who previously led legal and policy operations at Bird and government relations at Lyft, is no stranger to playing ball with regulatory agencies. It&#8217;s up to him to ensure Nuro gains the trust of the public by proving the company&#8217;s commitment to safety and the law.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lyft Self-Driving Platform Director Jody Kelman<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Lyft first began testing its autonomous vehicles in California in late 2018. The company had to pause those operations earlier this year as a result of the pandemic, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/30\/lyfts-self-driving-test-vehicles-are-back-on-public-roads-in-california\/\">but resumed testing in late June<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>That same month, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/23\/lyft-is-using-data-from-its-ride-share-drivers-to-develop-self-driving-cars\/\">Lyft began using data from its ride-hailing app<\/a> to build 3D maps, better understand human driving patterns and improve simulation tests for the company&#8217;s autonomous vehicle program.<\/p>\n<p>As part of Lyft&#8217;s go-to-market strategy, it has partnered with a number of companies. A key partner for Lyft has been Aptiv, which as of February, provided 100,000 paid rides on the Lyft app.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ve got something here,\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/11\/aptivs-self-driving-cars-have-given-100000-paid-rides-on-the-lyft-app\/\">Kelman said at the time to TechCrunch&#8217;s Kirsten Korosec<\/a>. &#8220;This is really a blueprint for what future mobility partnerships can look like.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Aurora Senior Manager of Government Relations Melissa Froelich<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Aurora, which launched back in 2017, had been developing a full-stack solution for self-driving vehicles that prioritized robotaxis. That changed in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/20\/aurora-expands-to-texas-in-bid-to-ramp-up-self-driving-truck-efforts\/\">October 2019<\/a>, when Aurora began focusing more on trucks and logistics and declared trucks would be the company&#8217;s first commercial product.<\/p>\n<p>Trucking comes with its own bag of worms, but folks seem to believe that AV trucking has a clearer path to profitability. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/20\/aurora-expands-to-texas-in-bid-to-ramp-up-self-driving-truck-efforts\/\">In July<\/a>, Aurora expanded into Texas to test commercial routes.
