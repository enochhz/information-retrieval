				<div class="author-profile__description">
					<p>Steve O&#8217;Hear is best known as a technology journalist, currently at TechCrunch where he focuses on European startups, companies and products.</p>
<p>He first joined TechCrunch in November 2009 as Contributing Editor for TechCrunch Europe, where he worked alongside Editor Mike Butcher to help build TechCrunch&#8217;s coverage in Europe.</p>
<p>In June 2011, Steve took a break from journalism to co-found the London and Prague-based startup Beepl. In his role as CEO, he helped the company raise its first VC round, along with seeing the Question &amp; Answer site through development, private alpha and a high profile public launch. In November 2012, Beepl was acquired by Brand Embassy.</p>
<p>Along with TechCrunch, Steve has written for numerous publications, including ZDNet (where he wrote the well-respected blog &#8216;The Social Web&#8217;), The Guardian, Macworld, TES, Last100 and ReadWriteWeb. He also wrote and directed the critically acclaimed Silicon Valley documentary &#8216;In Search of the Valley&#8217;, which was released in September 2006.</p>
<p>In 2002, Steve was made a fellow of the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts. He&#8217;s also one half of ProtoBake Labs, an &#8216;ideas incubator&#8217; he co-founded with Pete Harris.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: Steve owns a small amount of cryptocurrency, and doesn&#8217;t generally write about crypto currencies. If and when he does, he will always disclose any potential conflict of interest.</p>

legality and whether the app poses a risk to national security as the Trump administration claims.<\/p>\n<p>For weeks since President Donald Trump signed two executive orders in early August, the government has threatened to shut down the viral video sharing app over fears that its parent company <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/bytedance\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"bytedance\">ByteDance, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> headquartered in Beijing, could be forced to turn over user data to the Chinese government. TikTok, which has <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/tiktok-hits-100m-users-in-europe-as-the-clock-ticks-on-its-us-business\/\">100 million users<\/a>\u00a0in the United States alone, has long rejected the claims.<\/p>\n<p>TikTok first filed a lawsuit against the administration on September 18, and on Thursday this week filed a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/23\/tiktok-files-for-injunction-against-pending-trump-app-ban\/\">last minute injunction<\/a>\u00a0in an effort to stop the ban going into effect Sunday night. On Friday, the government asked the court to reject the injunction in a sealed motion, which the government later refiled as a public motion with some redactions. A public hearing on the injunction was set for Sunday morning. The case is being heard in DC District Court presided by judge\u00a0Carl J. Nichols.<\/p>\n<p>In its ruling on Sunday, the court gave just its decision, with the formal opinion handed over privately to just the two opposing parties. Due to sensitive material included in the government&#8217;s motion, the parties have until Monday to ask for any redactions before the final opinion will be published.<\/p>\n<p>The decision is just the latest episode in the continuing saga of the sprawling fight over the future of the fastest-growing social app in America. A <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/13\/oracle-wins-bid-to-buy-tiktok\/\">deal reached<\/a> between ByteDance and the U.S. government last weekend was believed to have resolved the standoff between the two parties, but the deal has frayed over disputed details\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/21\/tiktok-wtf\/\">between buyer Oracle<\/a> and ByteDance.<\/p>\n<p>The administration first launched an action against TikTok on August 6, with President Trump arguing in an executive order that the app posed an unreasonable national security risk for American citizens. That order mirrored a similar one published the same day that put restrictions on the popular Mandarin-language messenger app WeChat, which is owned by China-based Tencent.<\/p>\n<p>Last weekend, a federal magistrate judge in San Francisco put in place an injunction on <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/18\/tiktok-and-wechat-will-be-banned-in-the-u-s-from-sunday\/\">the Commerce Department\u2019s ban on WeChat<\/a>, pending further court deliberations. TikTok, whose arguments mirror those in the WeChat lawsuit, was hoping for a similar outcome in its own legal proceedings.<\/p>\n<p>One difference between the two lawsuits is the plaintiffs. In WeChat\u2019s case, a group of WeChat users filed a lawsuit arguing that a ban would hurt their expression of speech. TikTok is representing itself in its own fight with the government.<\/p>\n<p>The court case is TikTok Inc. et al v. Trump et al (1:2020-cv-02658).<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"5u633YLlKV\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/19\/tiktok-deal-terms\/\">The TikTok deal solves quite literally nothing<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;The TikTok deal solves quite literally nothing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/19\/tiktok-deal-terms\/embed\/#?secret=5u633YLlKV\" data-secret=\"5u633YLlKV\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A U.S. federal court has said a ban on TikTok will not go into effect\u00a0on Monday as scheduled.

Watch Series 6 review"},"content":{"rendered":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">When it comes<\/span> to smartwatches, it\u2019s Apple against the world. It\u2019s not that there aren\u2019t plenty of other products to choose from \u2014 it\u2019s more that the company has just utterly dominated the space to such a point that any other device is relegated to the realm of \u201c<a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Watch alternatives.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The company has been successful in the space for the usual Apple reasons: premium hardware with deeply integrated software, third-party support, a large cross-device ecosystem play and, of, course, simplicity. Taken as a whole, the Watch just works, right out of the box.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Five years after launch, the line is fairly mature. As such, it\u2019s no surprise, really, that recent updates have largely amounted to refinements. As with most updates, the watch has gotten a processor boost up to the A14 processor, which the company claims is 20% faster than the last version.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>Perhaps the biggest hardware upgrade, however, is the addition of a blood oxygen sensor, an important piece in the company\u2019s quest to offer as complete an image of wearer health as is possible from the wrist.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Dkvjc9vzsO\"><p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/a-closer-look-at-the-new-apple-watches\/\">A closer look at the new Apple Watches<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;A closer look at the new Apple Watches&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/a-closer-look-at-the-new-apple-watches\/embed\/#?secret=Dkvjc9vzsO\" data-secret=\"Dkvjc9vzsO\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">I wrote<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/a-closer-look-at-the-new-apple-watches\/\"> a pretty lengthy piece<\/a> about the watch last week after wearing it for a few days. As I mentioned at the time, it was an odd kind of writeup, somewhere between hands-on and review. A week or so later, however, I\u2019m more comfortable calling this a review \u2014 even if not too many of my initial impressions have changed much in the past several days. After all, a mature product largely means most of the foundations remain unchanged.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Series 6 certainly looks the part. The Watch is tough to distinguish from other recent models \u2014 and for that matter, the new and significantly cheaper SE. The biggest visual change is the addition of new colors. In addition to the standard Gray and Gold, Apple\u2019s added new Blue and (Product)Red cases. The latter seems to be the more ostentatious of the pair. The company sent me a blue model, and honestly, it\u2019s a lot more subtle than I expected. It\u2019s more of a deep blue hue, really, that reads more as black a lot of the time.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s tough to imagine the product undergoing any sort of radical rethink of the device\u2019s design language at this point. We may see slight tweaks, including larger screen area going forward, but on the whole, Apple is very much committed to a form factor that has worked very well for it. I will probably always prefer Samsung\u2019s spinning bezel as a quick way to interface with the operating system, but the crown does the job well and scrolling through menus even feels a bit zippier this time, perhaps owing to that faster silicon.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"LWNvL7GOH3\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/you-can-now-return-apples-solo-loop-for-a-new-size-without-sending-back-the-watch\/\">You can now return Apple\u2019s Solo Loop for a new size, without sending back the Watch<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;You can now return Apple\u2019s Solo Loop for a new size, without sending back the Watch&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/you-can-now-return-apples-solo-loop-for-a-new-size-without-sending-back-the-watch\/embed\/#?secret=LWNvL7GOH3\" data-secret=\"LWNvL7GOH3\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">The new Solo Loop bands hit a bit of a hiccup out of the gate. I\u2019ve <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/you-can-now-return-apples-solo-loop-for-a-new-size-without-sending-back-the-watch\/\">detailed that a bit more here<\/a>, but I suspect that much of the problem came down to the difficulty of selling a specifically sized product during a strange period in history where in-person try-ons aren\u2019t really an option. In other words, just really bad timing on that front.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Personally, I quite like the braided model. I\u2019ve been using it as my day to day band. It\u2019s nice and blends in a lot better than the silicone model (I\u2019ve frankly never been much of a fan of Apple\u2019s silicone bands). But I do need to mention that Apple sent me a couple different sizes, which made it much easier to find the right fit. I recognize that. Especially when the braided Solo Loop costs a fairly exorbitant $99. The silicone version is significantly cheaper at $49, but either way, you\u2019re not getting off cheap there. So you definitely want to make sure you get the right fit.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052164\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052164\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2052164\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg 4000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052164\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This is doubly important given the fact that the Series 6\u2019s biggest new feature \u2014 blood oxygen monitoring \u2014 is highly dependent on you getting a good fit. The sensor utilizes a series of LEDs on the bottom of the watch to shine infrared and red light through the wearer\u2019s skin and into their blood vessels. The color of light that reflects back gives the watch a picture of the oxygen levels in the blood. The whole thing takes about 15 seconds, but only works if your fit is right. Even with the right Solo Loop on, I found myself having to retake it a few times when I first started wearing the watch.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Beyond the on-demand measurements, the watch will also take readings throughout the day and night, mapping these trends over time and incorporating them into sleep readings. The overall readings will give you a good picture of your numbers over time. Honestly though, I get the sense that this is really just the tip of the iceberg of future functionality.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For now, there\u2019s really no specific guidance \u2014 or context \u2014 given as far as what the numbers mean. Mine are generally between 90-100%. The Mayo Clinic tells me that\u2019s good, but obviously there are a lot of different factors and variations that can\u2019t properly be contextualized in a single paragraph &#8212; or on a watch. And Apple certainly doesn\u2019t want to be accused of attempting to diagnose a condition or offer specific medical guidance. That\u2019s going to be an increasingly difficult line for the company to walk as it gets more serious about these sorts of health tools.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If I had to venture a guess, I would say that the combination of sleep tracking in watchOS 7 and the on-board oximeter opens the door pretty nicely for something like sleep apnea tracking (again, more focused on alerts of irregularity versus diagnosis). We\u2019ve seen a small handful of companies like Withings tackle this, so it seems like a no-brainer for Apple, pending all of the regulatory requirements, et al. There are all sorts of other conditions that blood oxygen levels could potentially alert the wearer to, if not actually diagnose.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sleep was probably the biggest addition with the latest version of watchOS. This was probably the biggest blind spot for the line, compared to the competition. At the moment, the sleep tracking is, admittedly, still pretty basic. Like much of the rest of the on-board tracking, it\u2019s mostly compared with changes over time. The metrics include time in bed versus time asleep, as well as incorporating heart rate figures from the sensor\u2019s regular check-ins. More specific breakdowns, including deep versus light versus REM sleep haven\u2019t arrived yet, but will no doubt be coming sooner than later.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052166\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052166\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2052166 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg 4000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052166\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The door is also wide open for Apple to really get mindfulness right. The company has incorporated a mindfulness reminder for a while now, but it\u2019s easy to imagine how the addition of various sensors like heart rate could really improve the picture and find the company going all-in on meditation, et al. The company could partner with a big meditation name \u2014 or, more likely, disrupt things with its own offering. The forthcoming Fitness+ offering could play an important role in the growth of that category, as well.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The other issue that sleep brings to the front is battery life. I was banking on the company making big strides in the battery department \u2014 after all, a big part of sleep tracking is ensuring that you\u2019ve got enough charge to get through the night. Apple really only briefly touched on battery \u2014 though <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ifixit.com\/Teardown\/Apple+Watch+Series+6+Teardown\/136694?utm_content=buffer408ad&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\">a recent teardown<\/a> has revealed some smallish improvements on battery capacity (perhaps owing, in part, to space freed up by the dropping of Force Touch).<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The company has also made some improvements to energy efficiency, courtesy of the new silicon. Official literature puts it at a \u201cfull-day\u201d of<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>battery life, up to 18 hours. I found I was able to get through a full day with juice to spare. That\u2019s good, but the company\u2019s still got some ground to make up on that front, compared to, say, the Fitbit Sense, which is capable of getting nearly a week on a charge. I think at this point, it\u2019s fair to hold wearables to higher standards of battery life than, say, handsets. More than once, I\u2019ve found myself intermittently charging the device \u2014 20 minutes here and 20 minutes there \u2014 in order to have enough juice left by bedtime.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"GxSVdjFou2\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/29\/apple-began-work-on-the-watchs-hand-washing-feature-years-before-covid-19\/\">Apple began work on the Watch\u2019s handwashing feature years before COVID-19<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Apple began work on the Watch\u2019s handwashing feature years before COVID-19&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/29\/apple-began-work-on-the-watchs-hand-washing-feature-years-before-covid-19\/embed\/#?secret=GxSVdjFou2\" data-secret=\"GxSVdjFou2\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you can spare more time than that, you should be able to get up to 80% in an hour or 100% in an hour and a half, courtesy of faster wireless charging. All told, the company has been able to shave significant time off of charging \u2014 a definite plus now that you\u2019re not just leaving it overnight to charge. The latest version of watchOS will also handily let you know before if you don\u2019t have enough charge to make it through a full night.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Other updates include the addition of the always-on Altimeter, which, along with the brighter screen doesn\u2019t appear to have had a major impact on the battery. I\u2019ll be honest, being stuck in the city for these last several months hasn\u2019t given me much reason to need real-time elevation stats. Though the feature is a nice step toward taking the Watch a bit more seriously as an outdoor accessory in a realm that has largely been dominated by the likes of Garmin.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052167\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052167\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2052167\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg 4000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052167\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Of course, the company now has three watches on the market \u2014 including the Series 3, which just keeps on ticking, and the lower-cost SE. The latter retains the design of the Series 6, but drops a number of the key sensors, which honestly should be perfectly sufficient for many users \u2014 and $170 cheaper than the 6\u2019s $399 starting price ($499 with cellular).<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Taken as a whole, the Series 6 isn\u2019t a huge leap forward over the Series 5 \u2014 and not really worth the upgrade for those who already own that recent vintage. But there are nice improvements throughout, augmented by good upgrades to watchOS that make the best-selling smartwatch that much better, while clearly laying the groundwork for Apple Watches of the future.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/Apple-Hardware-Event-2020\/\"><img src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/apple-hardware-event-2020.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When it comes to smartwatches, it\u2019s Apple against the world.

company he runs with managing partner Mary Chan, and would be part of a consortium of investors, according to one unnamed source who requested anonymity because the deal had yet to be finalized. The deal could close as early as mid-October.<\/p>\n<p>TuSimple as well as Girsky declined to comment.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>It&#8217;s no secret that TuSimple has been seeking new capital.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/26\/tusimple-seeking-250-million-in-new-funding-to-scale-self-driving-trucks\/\">TechCrunch reported in June that TuSimple was in search of $250 million<\/a> in fresh capital from investors. The company hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to help it raise funds, according to multiple sources familiar with the effort. Since then, TuSimple, which already has backing from Sina, UPS and Tier 1 supplier Mando Corp., has announced a partnership with Navistar and most recently, the Traton Group.<\/p>\n<p>Girsky has most recently captured headlines because of Nikola, where he is now the executive chairman. Girsky took over as chairman in September after Nikola&#8217;s founder, Trevor Milton, stepped down following fallout from <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/nikola-disputes-fraud-claims-in-carefully-worded-rebuttal\/\">a scathing report<\/a> by short-seller firm Hindenburg Research that accused the company of fraud. VectoIQ Acquisition Corp., the SPAC that Girsky formed in 2018, announced a merger with Nikola in March, and Girsky oversaw its public listing this past June. He shepherded an introduction between Nikola and his former boss, GM CEO and chairwoman Mary Barra, according to one source familiar with the deal. By mid-September the automaker had announced a partnership valued at $2 billion with Nikola.<\/p>\n<p>Girsky may be Nikola&#8217;s new chairman and certainly has executive experience, but his focus in recent years has been as an advisor, investor and matchmaker. Girsky has long had an interest in mobility-related companies. His firm VectoIQ LLC specializes in advising companies and connecting large companies with startups working on autonomous vehicle technology, electrification, connected, cybersecurity and mobility-as-a-service.<\/p>\n<p>VectoIQ invested in lidar startup Luminar, which recently announced it was going public through a SPAC merger with Gores Metropoulos Inc., at a post-deal market valuation of $3.4 billion. Girsky also sat on the board of autonomous vehicle startup Drive.ai, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/06\/25\/self-driving-startup-drive-ai-is-closing-down\/\">which was acquired by Apple<\/a> as the company prepared to shut down.<\/p>\n<p>Girsky&#8217;s investment in TuSimple is separate from his interests in Nikola, which has yet to begin production of its Class 8 trucks, according to sources.<\/p>\n<p>TuSimple, which launched in 2015 and has operations in China, San Diego and Tucson, Arizona, is focused on the autonomous vehicle technology stack that will allow Class 8 trucks to operate without a human driver. TuSimple operates a fleet of 40 self-driving trucks in the U.S. that are used for testing and to carry freight between Arizona and Texas.<\/p>\n<p>TuSimple announced in July plans to develop and begin producing autonomous semi trucks by 2024 in partnership with Navistar. In September, Volkswagen AG&#8217;s heavy-truck business Traton Group said it took a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/23\/vws-traton-group-strikes-a-deal-with-tusimple-to-develop-autonomous-trucks\/\">minority stake in TuSimple<\/a> as part of an agreement between the two companies to develop self-driving trucks. Neither company disclosed the financial terms of the partnership or the percentage of the minority stake. Traton did make a direct capital investment into TuSimple, according to one unnamed source familiar with the deal. It&#8217;s unclear if it also included in-kind contributions.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Steve Girsky, the former GM vice chairman, consultant and investor whose special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merged with hydrogen electric startup Nikola this summer, is in talks to back self-driving trucks startup TuSimple, according to four people familiar with the deal.

UX teardown: 5 fails and how to fix them"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">Digital currency exchange<\/span> Coinbase has probably done more than most to push cryptocurrencies closer to the mainstream, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/10\/30\/coinbase-is-now-valued-at-8b-after-closing-new-300m-round\/\">earning an $8 billion valuation<\/a> by private investors along the way. The company is <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/09\/coinbase-reported-to-consider-late-2020-early-2021-public-debut\/\">reportedly eyeing a public listing<\/a> next year, and is inarguably doing a lot of things right. However, that doesn&#8217;t mean its product experience is perfect. In fact, far from it.<\/p>\n<p>In our latest UX teardown, with the help of <a href=\"https:\/\/builtformars.co.uk\/\">Built for Mars<\/a> founder and UX expert Peter Ramsey, we highlight some of Coinbase&#8217;s biggest user experience failings and offer ways to fix them. Many of these lessons can be applied to other existing digital products or ones you are currently building, including the need to avoid the &#8220;Get Started&#8221; trap, the importance of providing feedback, why familiarity often wins and other principles.<\/p>\n<h2>The \u2018Get Started\u2019 trap<\/h2>\n<p>Only use CTAs like \u201cget started\u201d or \u201clearn more\u201d if you\u2019re actually teaching users something.<\/p>\n<p>The fail: <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/coinbase\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"coinbase\">Coinbase <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> doesn\u2019t actually have any onboarding \u2014 but it looks like it does. It has a very prominent \u201cget started\u201d CTA, which actually just puts bitcoins in your basket. This isn\u2019t helping you get started, it\u2019s nothing more than an onboarding Trojan horse.<\/p>\n<p>The fix: It\u2019s simple: Don\u2019t lie in your CTAs. You wouldn\u2019t have \u201cEmail Support\u201d as a CTA, and then just show the user a bunch of FAQs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Steve O\u2019Hear: This feels like another classic &#8220;bait and switch&#8221; and reeks of dark pattern design. However, what if it actually works to get users over the line and purchase their first bitcoin? Growth hackers, rejoice, no?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/peter-ramsey\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"peter-ramsey\">Peter Ramsey:<\/strong> <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> You\u2019re absolutely right, this may convert better. From a business point of view, this could be a brilliant little growth hack. However, something converting well doesn\u2019t mean it was a good experience for the user. Look at clickbait-y journalism \u2014 it gets more eyeballs, but people aren\u2019t generally happy with what they read.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m convinced that in the long term having a great product will perform better than frustrating short-term growth hacks.<\/p>\n<h2>Feedback architecture<\/h2>\n<p>As a general rule of thumb, all &#8220;states&#8221; &#8212; e.g., success\/failure of an action &#8212; need to provide feedback to the user.<\/p>\n<p>The fail: After adding a card, you click &#8220;Add Card,&#8221; and \u2026 it takes you back to the homepage. There\u2019s no notice if it was successful or not. The user has no awareness if the action they were trying to do failed and they need to do it again. This is a real problem with digital products: All feedback needs to be thought of and built.<\/p>\n<p>The fix: During the design phase, consider statuses and what the user will want feedback on. For example, if they\u2019ve just added an item to their &#8220;wishlist,&#8221; how will you show them that the action was successful?<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Digital currency exchange Coinbase has probably done more than most to push cryptocurrencies closer to the mainstream, earning an $8 billion valuation by private investors along the way.

The Munich, Germany-founded company&#8217;s self-described mission is to &#8220;challenge and inspire people to become the greatest version of themselves, both mentally and physically.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The Freeletics app offers AI-powered fitness and mindset coaching, and has 48 million users in more than 160 countries, claiming to be the No. 1 fitness app in Europe with more than 600,000 paid-for subscriptions. The &#8220;personal trainer in your pocket&#8221; aims to help you train anytime, anywhere, with personalised training plans and workouts. Its algorithms learn from the app&#8217;s millions of users and the individual feedback they provide, with the goal of developing &#8220;smart&#8221; training journeys uniquely designed to suit different users in different contexts.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhile a relatively new player in the U.S., Freeletics is a clear global leader in at-home fitness and we believe they are perfectly positioned to continue leading the fitness industry into the future post-COVID-19 in the U.S. market,\u201d said John Spinale, managing partner at JAZZ Venture Partners. &#8220;In an ocean of unpersonalized fitness streaming concepts, they offer a sophisticated and adaptive personal coach for every aspect of performance and well-being &#8212; whether mental or physical. This is a promising indication of what is still to come.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We want to give anyone the right plan and guidance to reach their goals, on their terms, and ultimately lead to a long-term behavior change so they can continue leading that lifestyle for the rest of their lives,&#8221; Freeletics CEO Daniel Sobhani tells TechCrunch. &#8220;Not everything the fitness industry has been telling us for the last 30 years has been setting people up for success, so we want to put an end to that and be clear and honest about the work it takes to reach your goals, while making real, sustainable results accessible to as many people as possible. And those goals don\u2019t have to be just losing weight. Whatever the finish line looks like, we want to get people there in the most efficient, sustainable and enjoyable way.<\/p>\n<p>Sobhani says Freeletics&#8217; AI provides &#8220;hyper-personalized&#8221; fitness coaching, paired with mindset training for a more holistic experience. &#8220;The AI-powered coach curates the workouts best suited to every single user, so that they are always super efficient and effective, making it easier to work towards your goal,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;We focus so much on personalization because, in the end, there is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to health and fitness. We then pair this technology with our efforts in the product to reduce the everyday hurdles people face when it comes to working out regularly &#8212; time, space, equipment, knowledge, money, confidence and so on.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The idea is that Freeletics lets you work out on your own terms, in terms of how, when and where you want. For each day of your training plan, the AI coach can draw from 3.5 million options. So, for example, you may want a quiet workout plan without equipment that fits with your small city apartment and that won\u2019t disturb the neighbours. Or one that only requires 15 minutes. Or perhaps you want to lift weights instead. Based on these and a plethora of other criteria, Freeletics promises to adapt to your needs accordingly.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;For the finishing touch, we combine this personalized training experience with the mental component &#8212; audio coaching, which aims to educate, motivate and bring more mindfulness to the whole experience,&#8221; adds Sobhani. &#8220;This mindset coaching builds the sustainable basis for our users to make life-long improvements to their lifestyles, aiming to help them build healthy habits and better understand their journey, all while putting more emphasis on mindfulness and meditation for better long-term results across the board.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Freeletics operates a classic freemium model. The app is free to download and use to a certain extent, but for more personal coaching you&#8217;ll need to pay for a subscription.

Businesses only repay the capital as they generate revenue, &#8220;with no set repayment date and no compounding interest, equity or personal guarantees&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>It was originally pitched as being particularly suited to revenue-generating companies wishing to invest in online marketing to grow sales more quickly, but has since widened its target to other scenarios.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When we launched, we knew selling equity to buy Facebook and Google ads was a bad deal for founders,&#8221; says Ismail. &#8220;So this is where we focused and mainly funded companies for advertising and inventory. Since then we\u2019ve set out to help companies get funding for any purpose including launching a new product, expanding internationally, or growing the team&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Post-launch and through refining its technology, Uncapped has sped up the time it takes to make a lending decision from three days to a few hours. Once financing has been agreed, the startup can also now issue Visa cards so founders can start spending funds immediately.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;With this new investment round, we\u2019ve also started funding earlier-stage companies with only six months of revenue history (previously our minimum was nine months),&#8221; says Ismail. &#8220;We\u2019ve also doubled the amount we can advance at one time to \u00a32 million. So now more companies can access funding for more use cases, and faster&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Asked how the coronavirus pandemic has affected the way Uncapped evaluates risk, where past revenue performance may not be a reliable indicator going forward, Pisarz says a recession in some ways is the best time to build a credit model, &#8220;as everyone else\u2019s models are now irrelevant&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Whereas other online lenders depend on personal guarantees and the founder\u2019s own credit history as the main drivers of their risk models, we use live data about the company\u2019s actual trading to make our decisions,&#8221; he tells me. &#8220;When the pandemic hit, we were able to access the real-time data about how our portfolio was performing, make quick decisions and continue to issue credit, where others were forced to pull back. Our number of investments and the returns have since grown exponentially&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>To boot, Pisarz says Uncapped has continued to upgrade its underwriting technology, and having now seen how different business models adjust to more challenging times, it has built more confidence in its underwriting.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Unlike a VC, we need our whole portfolio to succeed, not just a few that make up for the losses of the others. So we need to have a lot of certainty in our decision making,&#8221; he concedes.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Equity was the most expensive way to fund digital ad spend and repeatable growth, and as fundraising has become even harder due to the pandemic, it has only become more expensive,&#8221; adds Ismail. &#8220;So our sweet spot continues to be direct-to-consumer products and other fast-monetising startups that generate between \u00a310,000-\u00a32 million of monthly sales, have healthy unit economics and want to avoid diluting their founders and existing investors.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;For businesses that are still in the R&amp;D stage or need more time to get to market, venture is still a good solution, but for businesses who are already live, have predictable customer acquisition costs, and repeatable growth, we know we are a better option&#8221;.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Uncapped, the London-headquartered and Warsaw-based startup that offers \u201crevenue-based\u201d finance to European businesses so that founders don&#8217;t have to give up equity stipulated by venture capital, has raised $26 million in new funding.

startup that aims to take the hassle out of car ownership, is breaking cover today. Founded by Sai Lakshmi, who previously co-founded Echo, the medication management service <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/06\/19\/echo-joins-mckesson\/\">acquired by LloydsPharmacy owner McKesson<\/a>, Caura is an iOS app designed to manage all of the vehicle-related admin that car owners endure.<\/p>\n<p>Drivers are on-boarded to Caura by entering their vehicle registration number. They&#8217;ll then be able to manage parking, tolls, MOT, road tax, car insurance and congestion charges &#8212; a &#8220;one-stop shop&#8221; app in a similar vain to Echo, perhaps. The idea is that Caura minimises car ownership admin and helps to mitigate associated penalty fines.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;After my girlfriend racked up hundreds of pounds of parking fines, I started doing market research,&#8221; explains Lakshmi. &#8220;It was clear there was an opportunity to build something in the space that made life easier for drivers &#8212; after all, I\u2019d just spent the past seven years thinking about how to make the NHS run smoothly &#8212; this should be easy in comparison! I toyed with several different models, including hardware, and after a few pretty direct conversations with some Apple engineering folks, decided to focus on the software platform: it would be more accessible to more people and easier to integrate with private and public services we\u2019d need to interface with if we wanted to be a one-stop shop for your car.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Lakshmi says that after purchasing his first car that shipped with Apple CarPlay, he was &#8220;blown away&#8221; by how slick the interface is for entertainment, communication and maps, but also became convinced there was more to be done in this space. &#8220;I then thought it would be brilliant to have one single app to add all your vehicle-related payments to streamline the experience, improve vehicle compliance and make paying for parking and the ever-changing digital road landscape simple,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2049218\" style=\"width: 359px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2049218\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical wp-image-2049218 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/4.-CC-ULEZ-ICE.png?w=349\" alt=\"\" width=\"349\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/4.-CC-ULEZ-ICE.png 7372w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/4.-CC-ULEZ-ICE.png?resize=77,150 77w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/4.-CC-ULEZ-ICE.png?resize=154,300 154w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/4.-CC-ULEZ-ICE.png?resize=768,1495 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/4.-CC-ULEZ-ICE.png?resize=349,680 349w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/4.-CC-ULEZ-ICE.png?resize=789,1536 789w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/4.-CC-ULEZ-ICE.png?resize=1052,2048 1052w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/4.-CC-ULEZ-ICE.png?resize=26,50 26w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 349px) 100vw, 349px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2049218\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits: Caura<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve downloaded the app and entered your vehicle registration number, you can view the status of your car\u2019s tax, MOT and insurance renewal dates. From the home screen, you can also pay for selected parking, toll roads and congestion charges.<\/p>\n<p>The FCA-approved app integrates with Apple Pay or will safely store payment details, which can be used to pay car charges &#8220;in just two clicks.&#8221; In-app notifications also remind you when it&#8217;s time to pay, with Caura promising to reduce the millions of automated fines or penalty charge notices that are issued to Brits each year.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There are dozens of platforms that drivers need to manage just one car,&#8221; notes Lakshmi. &#8220;On a more regular basis, you need a dozen parking apps and other websites to manage your drive. These all have their own log-ins, forms and payment details and the whole experience is a dog&#8217;s dinner. There are apps that insist on CVC codes being entered every time you use them and others that insist on SMS messages for reminders, which is so 2000, not 2020. Also, if you get any of this wrong, you get lumped with automated fines.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Caura can be used for a single vehicle, but can also support multiple registered vehicles, meaning it can potentially scale for fleet managers. An Android version is also promised by the end of the year.<\/p>\n<p>Lakshmi says he and his co-founders &#8212; Shaun Foce (director of engineering) and Bhavin Kotecha (chief of staff and finance director) &#8212; have already raised \u00a31.4 million for Caura. Backing comes from various unnamed angels, although he says 50% of Caura&#8217;s investors have connections to his previous company.<\/p>\n<p>Asked how the startup generates revenue, &#8220;Right now, we don\u2019t,&#8221; replies the Caura founder. &#8220;We\u2019re just passing through these payments to the final provider like congestion charge and parking. Given the seismic shift in investor mindset from crazy growth to building profitable businesses, our long-term business model is most certainly something with sustainable unit economics. It\u2019s currently in the oven and we\u2019re really excited to share more in Q4 2020 later this year.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Caura, a new U.K. startup that aims to take the hassle out of car ownership, is breaking cover today.

Point Nine outs new ~\u20ac100M fund to back early-stage SaaS and digital marketplaces"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"http:\/\/pointninecap.com\">Point Nine<\/a>, the pan-European early-stage VC focused on SaaS and digital marketplaces, has raised its fifth fund, totalling just short of \u20ac100 million (in fact, &#8220;P9 V&#8221; is a \u20ac99,999,999 fund &#8212; get it?).<\/p>\n<p>Despite its Berlin, Germany roots, the VC has always operated fairly remotely and invests globally. In total, it has invested in more than 140 companies in 28 countries over the last 10 years.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/point-nine-capital\/\">Historically<\/a>, Point Nine has been an early backer of well-known and up and coming companies, such as Algolia, Brainly, Chainalysis, Contentful, Delivery Hero, DocPlanner, Loom, Mambu, Revolut and Typeform.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>To that end, armed with new capital to deploy, it is largely business as usual for Point Nine. The VC invests between \u20ac0.5 to \u20ac2.5 million per company initially and says it is committed to participating in the Series A rounds of all portfolio companies. As noted, its investment remit is B2B SaaS and B2B marketplace startups, primarily across Europe and North America.<\/p>\n<h2>An equal partnership: &#8216;a feature, not a bug&#8217;<\/h2>\n<p>Along with the new fund, Point Nine is announcing the addition of two new partners, Louis Coppey and Ricardo Sequerra Amram. Notably, the firm is moving to an &#8220;equal partnership&#8221; model (\u00e0 la Benchmark), meaning that Coppey and Amram will share equal carry (profits) with the firm&#8217;s founding partners, Pawel Chudzinski and Christoph Janz.<\/p>\n<p>Coppey joined Point Nine as an associate four years ago and led the firm\u2019s investments in PlayPlay, cargo.one and Qwilr. Sequerra Amram joined Point Nine from Cherry Ventures, where he is said to have sourced and worked with Rekki and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/infarm-raises-170m-in-equity-and-debt\/\">Infarm<\/a>, amongst other companies. Prior to Cherry, he worked in various operational and investment roles at Faber Ventures, Seedrs and Seedcamp.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAlmost ten years after starting Point Nine, we are thrilled to announce that two up-and-coming stars in the tech industry have joined us as equal Partners,&#8221; says Point Nine&#8217;s Christoph Janz, in a statement. &#8220;Both Louis and Ricardo have demonstrated an extraordinary ability to spot new companies, develop strong bonds with entrepreneurs, contribute to the tech community, and help early-stage startups beat the odds. At ages 29 and 30, they are significantly earlier in their careers than the two of us. That\u2019s a feature of our equal partnership, not a bug,\u201d says Christoph Janz&#8221;.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Point Nine, the pan-European early-stage VC focused on SaaS and digital marketplaces, has raised its fifth fund, totalling just short of \u20ac100 million (in fact, &#8220;P9 V&#8221; is a \u20ac99,999,999 fund &#8212; get it?).

London-based VC that backs early-stage founders in Europe, has closed its second seed fund at \u00a381 million.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s only a tad larger than <a

Portfolio companies from fund one include Five, which is building software for autonomous vehicles; Paddle, the SaaS for software e-commerce; Pollen, the peer-to-peer marketplace for experiences and travel; and Farewill, which lets you create a will online.<\/p>\n<p>However, perhaps what really sets Kindred apart from most other seed VCs is its &#8220;Equitable Venture.&#8221; This sees the founders it backs get carry in the fund, effectively becoming co-owners of Kindred. Once the VC&#8217;s LPs have their investment returned, like the firm&#8217;s partners, the founders also share any subsequent fund profits, as long as they have passed the vesting period.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>More broadly, Kindred says the idea is this extra incentive encourages a collective model, in which founders actively help each other achieve their goals. &#8220;This has also had a positive impact on deal flow, with entrepreneurs sourcing 38% of Kindred\u2019s deal flow at the top of the funnel,&#8221; says the VC.<\/p>\n<p>Notably, Kindred projects that around \u00a35 million will be returned to founders from the first fund, profit that would otherwise have gone to its own general partners. Presuming those exits are realised, based on two founders per startup, a quick back of the napkin calculation suggests that&#8217;s just over \u00a380,000 each.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Kindred already begun investing from its second fund. It has led 10 seed investments in companies such as BotsAndUs, Gravity Sketch and Beit.<\/p>\n<p>LPs in fund two include: University of Chicago, Industry Ventures, Generation Ventures, Sands Capital, British Patient Capital, Isomer and Legal &amp; General. Founders such as Taavet Hinrikus (TransferWise), Carsten Thoma (Hybris) and Rishi Khosla (Oak North) have also invested in Kindred&#8217;s second fund.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"JvoPmRWTp2\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/02\/pollen-clause-for-concern\/\">Former Pollen employees were asked to sign an &#8216;NDA masked as a severance agreement&#8217;<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Former Pollen employees were asked to sign an &#8216;NDA masked as a severance agreement&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/02\/pollen-clause-for-concern\/embed\/#?secret=JvoPmRWTp2\" data-secret=\"JvoPmRWTp2\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Kindred Capital, the London-based VC that backs early-stage founders in Europe, has closed its second seed fund at \u00a381 million.

the future, why wouldn&#8217;t they just start companies themselves? That&#8217;s the question <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/hussein-kanji\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"hussein-kanji\">Hussein Kanji, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> founding partner at <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/18\/hoxton-ventures-2\/\">Hoxton Ventures<\/a>, asked rhetorically at Disrupt 2020.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If anyone says that they have predictive power in this industry and says they know where the future is gonna be, I just question the wisdom of this,&#8221; he said during a session exploring how VCs seek out new markets before they even exist. &#8220;Because if you could figure it out, you could come up with the idea, you&#8217;re capable enough to be able to put all the pieces together, why would you not found the business?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Instead, the key to betting on the future is to learn to ask the stupid questions. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s actually perfectly fine in the venture industry to not be the smart person and to kind of train yourself to be stupid and ask the stupid questions,&#8221; said Kanji. &#8220;I think a lot of people are probably too shy to do that. And a lot of people [are] probably too risk averse to then write the check when they don&#8217;t really understand exactly what it is that they&#8217;re investing into. But a lot of this stuff is a light bulb moment.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>One of those light bulb moments was <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/hoxton-ventures\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"hoxton-ventures\">Hoxton Ventures&#8217; <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> investment in Deliveroo, the takeout food delivery service that competes with Uber Eats and helped turn almost every restaurant into a food delivery service. However, Kanji reminded us that the European unicorn wasn&#8217;t the first company to try takeout delivery, but new technology, in the form of cheap smartphones coupled with GPS and routing algorithms, meant the timing was now right.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;People did try delivery,&#8221; he said, &#8220;they tried it back in the 90s. Everyone forgets about that. There&#8217;s a company in New York City called Kozmo that would go off and like get you a pint of ice cream on demand. You know, it never worked because they used pagers. Like, do you remember pagers? Like, that&#8217;s how they ran the fleet. They couldn&#8217;t move the fleet around. They couldn&#8217;t get the driver to the apartment and the driver to the store in any kind of efficient way&#8230; The breakthrough for delivery, and for that whole industry, was you had smartphones, you could give smartphones to the drivers, you could track what the driver was doing, which is good because then you could route logistics, you know, with a smartphone&#8230; light bulb moment.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Kanji said that, although they are very different businesses and markets, Hoxton&#8217;s two other unicorns, Babylon and Darktrace, involved similar light bulb moments. Yet you don&#8217;t get that light bulb moment until someone walks in the door and explains it to you. &#8220;Then your natural question is&#8230; why now&#8230; what&#8217;s actually changed? Like, what makes this so interesting? Why didn&#8217;t someone come up with this a year ago? There&#8217;s almost always usually a reason for that kind of stuff. And then the harder part of the job is&#8230; are you really picking number one?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Entering or helping to create new markets is often not without controversy &#8212; which both <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/25\/first-do-no-harm\/\">Babylon<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/12\/05\/unions-human-rights-challenge-to-deliveroo-dismissed-by-uk-high-court\/\">Deliveroo<\/a> has attracted for different reasons. As real disruption inevitably creates societal consequences, it often raises ethical questions that, the Hoxton co-founder argues, aren&#8217;t always possible to anticipate early on. However, as the picture becomes clearer, he says VCs should absolutely care, along with, of course, founders and CEOs.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the constant criticisms in the tech industry is, I think the maturity of our industry&#8230; we behave more like teenagers. And it&#8217;s great to be libertarian, it&#8217;s great to be free markets and say markets are gonna sort it out. But you&#8217;re gonna have touch points with a lot of other places in society. You&#8217;ve got to figure out, and I think, get ahead in terms of&#8230;what the impact is going to be, and be more responsible.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f5c0f26b65dff2c9a07d8e3\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If venture capitalists could predict the future, why wouldn&#8217;t they just start companies themselves?

The firm offers \u201cpatient capital\u201d \u2014 with only a single LP (the Danish family office IPQ Capital) \u2014 and promises to provide portfolio companies with deep healthcare expertise and the extra runway needed to get over regulatory and efficacy hurdles and to the next stage.<\/p>\n<p>The firm has an initial $65 million to deploy and is led by consultant radiologist Dr. Fiona Pathiraja. With offices in London and Copenhagen, it operates as an \u201cevergreen\u201d fund, meaning it doesn\u2019t follow traditional five-year VC fundraising cycles.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/crista-galli-ventures\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"crista-galli-ventures\">Crista Galli Ventures&#8217; <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> pitch is that traditional venture isn&#8217;t well-suited to early-stage health tech where it can take significantly longer to find product-market fit with healthcare practitioners and systems and then become licensed by local regulators.<\/p>\n<p>To dig deeper into this and CGV&#8217;s investment remit more generally, I interviewed Pathiraja about what she looks for in health tech founders and startups. We also discussed Crista Galli LABS, which operates alongside the main fund and backs founders from underrepresented backgrounds at the pre-seed stage.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TechCrunch: You describe Crista Galli Ventures (CGV) as an early-stage health tech fund that offers patient capital and backs companies in Europe. In particular, you cite deep tech, digital health and personalised healthcare. Can you elaborate a bit more on the fund\u2019s remit and what you look for in founders and startups at such an early stage?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Fiona Pathiraja:<\/strong> We like founders with bold ideas and international ambitions. We look for mission-driven founders who believe their companies can make a real and positive impact on the lives of people and patients the world over.<\/p>\n<p>We will look for founders who deeply understand the problem they are trying to tackle from all angles \u2014 especially the patient\u2019s perspective, but also that of the clinician and relevant regulators \u2014 and we want to see that they are building their solutions to solve this. This means they will make an effort to understand the complex and nuanced healthcare landscape and all the stakeholders in it.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of founder characteristics, in my opinion, the best founders will be mission driven, able to tell a compelling story, and motivate others to join them. Grit and resilience are important and several of our portfolio companies were founded around 6-8 years ago and they are doggedly continuing to build.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Crista Galli Ventures, a new early-stage health tech fund in Europe, officially launched last week.

Its modular, IoT-powered vertical farming units claim to use 99.5% less space than soil-based agriculture, 95% less water, 90% less transport and <em>zero<\/em> chemical pesticides. In addition, 90% of electricity used throughout the Infarm network is from renewable energy and the company has set a target to reach zero emission food production next year.<\/p>\n<p>Founded in 2013 by <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/osnat-michaeli\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"osnat-michaeli\">Osnat Michaeli, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and brothers Erez and Guy Galonska, Infarm&#8217;s \u201cindoor vertical farming\u201d system is capable of growing herbs, lettuce and other vegetables. It then places these modular farms in a variety of customer-facing city locations, such as grocery stores, restaurants, shopping malls and schools, thus enabling the end-customer to actually pick the produce themselves. To further scale, it also installs Infarms in local distribution centres.<\/p>\n<p>The distributed system is designed to be infinitely scalable \u2014 you simply add more modules, space permitting \u2014 whilst the whole thing is cloud-based, meaning the farms can be monitored and controlled from Infarm\u2019s central control centre. It\u2019s also incredibly data-driven, a combination of IoT, Big Data and cloud analytics akin to \u201cFarming-as-a-Service.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The idea, the founding team told me back <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/06\/26\/infarm\/\">in 2017\u00a0when I profiled the nascent company<\/a>, isn\u2019t just to produce fresher and better-tasting produce and re-introduce forgotten or rare varieties, but to disrupt the supply chain as a whole, which remains inefficient and produces a lot of waste.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBehind our farms is a robust hardware and software platform for precision farming,\u201d explained Michaeli at the time. \u201cEach farming unit is its own individual ecosystem, creating the exact environment our plants need to flourish. We are able to develop growing recipes that tailor the light spectrums, temperature, pH and nutrients to ensure the maximum natural expression of each plant in terms of flavor, colour and nutritional quality.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>On that note, I caught up with two of Infarm&#8217;s founders to get a brief update on the Berlin-headquartered company and to dive a little deeper into how it will continue to scale.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TechCrunch: What assumptions did you make early on that have turned out to be true or, more interestingly, not panned out as expected?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Osnat Michaeli:<\/strong> When we first chatted about four years ago, we were 40 people in Berlin and much of the conversation centered around the potential that our approach to urban vertical farming might have for retailers. While for many it was intriguing as a concept, we couldn\u2019t have imagined that a few years later we would have expanded to almost 10 countries (Japan is on its way) and 30 cities, with partnerships with some of the largest retailers in the world. Our assumptions at the time were that retailers and their customers would be attracted to the taste and freshness of produce that grew right in front of them in the produce section, in our farms.<\/p>\n<p>What we didn\u2019t anticipate was how much and how quickly the demand for a sustainable, transparent and modular approach to farming would grow as we, as society, begin to feel the impact of climate change and supply chain fragility upon our lives, our choices and our food. Of course we also did not anticipate a global pandemic, which has underscored the urgency of building a new food system that can democratize access to high-quality, amazing-tasting food, while helping our planet regenerate and heal. The past few months have confirmed the flexibility and resilience of our farming model, and that our mission is more relevant than ever.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In terms of signing on new retailers, based on your progress in the last 12 months, I&#8217;m guessing this has gotten easier, though undoubtedly there are still quite long lead times. How have these conversations changed since you started?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Erez Galonska:<\/strong> While lead times and speed of conversations can vary depending upon the region and retailer. In mature markets where the concept is familiar and we\u2019re already engaged, deal conversations can reach maturity in as little time as three months. Since we last spoke we are already working with most of the leading retailers that are well established in Europe, U.K. and North America. Brands which in each of their markets are both forerunners in a retail industry rapidly evolving to meet the demand for consumer-focused innovation, while proving that access to sustainable, high-quality, fresh and living produce is not only possible, but can be available in produce aisles today, and every day of the year, with Infarm.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m interested to understand where Infarms are installed, in terms of if the majority is in-store and consumer-facing or if the most scalable and bulk of Infarm&#8217;s use cases are really much larger distribution hubs in cities or close to cities, i.e. not too far away from places with population\/store density but not actually in stores. Perhaps you can enlighten me on what the ratio looks like today and how you see it developing as vertical farming grows?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Erez Galonska:<\/strong> Today across our markets, the split between our farms in stores and in distribution centers is roughly 50\/50. However, as you anticipate, we will be expanding our network this year with many more distribution hubs. This expansion will likely lead to an 80\/20 split as early as next year, with the majority of our regions being served with fresh, living produce delivered throughout the week from centrally located hubs. This not only offers retailers and restaurants flexibility in terms of volumes of output, and the ability to adapt the presentation of our offerings to floor areas of different sizes, but it also allows us to begin to serve whole regions from our next-generation farms under development today.<\/p>\n<p>Based in our hubs, these farms will deliver the crop equivalent of an acre or more of fresh produce on a 25 m2 footprint, with significant further savings in energy, water, labor and land use. We believe this technology will truly challenge ideas of what is possible in sustainable, vertical farming and we look forward to talking about it more soon.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lastly, what are the main product lines in terms of food on the shelves?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Osnat Michaeli:<\/strong> We have a catalog of more than 65 herbs, microgreens and leafy greens that is constantly growing.

One very expensive location with one brand that cannot evolve as food trends change. The result is ambitious and successful food providers not being able to capitalise on the soaring delivery market. So, we\u2019ve fixed this.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>On the demand side, Kbox has created a multicuisine range of delivery focused food brands, &#8220;so kitchens can serve more local people, more easily, with the ability to adapt swiftly to demand flux and taste changes,&#8221; she says. &#8220;And on the supply side, our tech platform digitises kitchen operations to make them efficient.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>However, Vellani claims that what makes Kbox special is its AI and machine learning tech, which enables advanced analytics. This sees the startup help kitchens find the right set of food brands for their local market, and then &#8220;future proof&#8221; them by keeping menus current through data analysis without the need for a data scientist. &#8220;Using our AI, we can also forecast demand for each kitchen, which in turn minimises waste, improves staff utilisation and morale, and thus improves the profitability of each host kitchen,&#8221; she explains.<\/p>\n<p>To that end, Vellani says there is no upfront cost to franchise Kbox brands and technology and &#8220;zero investment&#8221; in kitchen upgrades or equipment. Furthermore, Kbox generates revenue on a per order basis so it only benefits when the kitchen makes money. In other words, one of the biggest draws is there&#8217;s little risk for a host kitchen when working with Kbox.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I recall having a conversation last week with the senior EVP of one of the most well-known hotel asset owners in the world and he said to me, and I paraphrase: &#8216;so basically this is a risk-free model with absolutely no downside to us &#8212; the only thing I can see happening if this doesn&#8217;t work is you have simply upskilled my staff. I am going to make sure all of my hotel owners talk to you&#8217;,&#8221; says the Kbox founder.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, there appears to be no exact equivalent offering in the dark kitchen space currently, although there are several heavily funded players tackling the real estate angle \u2013- a kitchen rental model if you will. Others are building dark kitchen operations and licensing brands from third parties, or creating their own brands.<\/p>\n<p>Adds Vellani: &#8220;We are at the very early stages of a massive shift in not only the restaurant industry but in the food service and hospitality industry as a whole. COVID has simply accelerated a shift we were already seeing but it has also highlighted a very pertinent issue \u2013 these industries are running on razor-thin margins that are not sustainable and only Kbox is really focused on enabling existing food operators to move into the delivery-first era without incurring large costs by utilising what they already have&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>So far, the model appears to be working &#8212; hence today&#8217;s injection of capital. To date, Kbox has partnered with kitchens in London, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Brighton, and says it is on course for 2,000 operational kitchens in the U.K. before the end of 2021. In addition, an international rollout of the model is underway with franchise agreements in Australia and India launching this month with a further eight countries to be launched next year.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Kbox Global, the U.K. startup that turns underused commercial kitchen space into takeout delivery hubs &#8212; therefore helping existing kitchens generate much-needed revenue &#8212; has raised \u00a312 million in new funding.

The startup has developed what it dubs a &#8220;revenue marketing automation tool&#8221; that is designed to enable sales and marketing functions to work together to drive revenue.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;SMBs still struggle to unite sales and marketing data,&#8221; Purde tells me. &#8220;Money and time is wasted setting up workflows, connecting databases with digital duct tape and manually pulling reports&#8230; This [also] means that everyone misses opportunities, as well as revenue goals.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, salespeople have no context for sales conversations and don\u2019t know which leads are ready to buy, and leadership doesn&#8217;t easily have \u201cbig picture\u201d visibility into the effectiveness of campaigns. &#8220;Last but not least, all of us receive lots of \u2018spam\u2019 instead of relevant messages,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p>To solve this, Outfunnel&#8217;s secret sauce sees it integrate deeply with CRMs (currently Pipedrive, Copper and HubSpot CRM, with more to follow) coupled with various features such as automated emails in sync with CRM data, reporting and precise targeting. The startup has already won over more than 400 paying customers, with North America being its biggest market, followed by larger European countries and Australia.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our typical customer is a small to medium-sized business that needs both sales and marketing and where sales cycles are longer, not transactional,&#8221; adds Purde. &#8220;That\u2019s roughly 25% of all SMBs according to our estimations e.g. businesses selling professional services, consulting, real estate, healthcare&#8230; That said, we have some better-known scale-ups as customers, too, such as Bolt.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Outfunnel, a startup that has built software to help companies &#8220;bridge the gap between marketing and sales functions,&#8221; has quietly raised \u20ac1.1 million in funding.

It brings the total amount raised by Gravity Sketch to $5.4 million. In addition, the startup previously received grant funding from InnovationRCA and the James Dyson Foundation.<\/p>\n<p>Founded in 2014 by Oluwaseyi Sosanya, Daniela Paredes and Daniel Thomas, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/gravity-2\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"gravity-2\">Gravity Sketch <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> wants to change the way physical products are designed, developed and brought to market. It offers 3D design software for cross-disciplinary teams so they can &#8220;create, collaborate, and review&#8221; in a much more frictionless way, including via virtual reality, in which collaboration can take place in 3D and real time. The idea is to help speed up development cycles, especially involving globally distributed and increasingly remote teams.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;Collaboration is increasingly important as time frames are shortened and consumers request products sooner, with more features, and produced more sustainably,&#8221; says Oluwaseyi Sosanya, CEO and co-founder of Gravity Sketch. &#8220;There is also a surge in multinational companies growing globally distributed design and engineering teams, who need to stay connected in order to deliver with the same accuracy they once did being in the same location. Small-to-mid-sized design firms who service large companies must also adopt this approach in order to win business &#8212; they often gain work from international clients that are unable to meet face to face as frequently as their domestic clients, and are also held to extremely high standards of delivery.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In addition to pressure brought about by faster product cycles and remote working, the product design process itself isn&#8217;t always optimum, involving multiple teams with different disciplines and software tools and a jump from 2D to 3D. &#8220;When we talk about designing a physical product, we\u2019re imagining this object in 3D,&#8221; says Sosanya. &#8220;However, for many years we have had to bring out that idea through 2D mediums, or through rough physical models. All physical products start with 2D sketches, which are then painstakingly translated to digital 3D models and then produced through standard manufacturing processes.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>To mitigate this, Gravity Sketch brings the designer into the digital 3D space from the initial sketch phase, which gives them greater control over the initial idea and how it develops. The full design team can then join the same VR space to get a full understanding of the design from the designer\u2019s perspective before investing time and resources.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The designer can more accurately get all stakeholders on the same page at the ideation phase,&#8221; Sosanya explains. &#8220;With VR we can leverage the fact that everyone thinks in 3D and offer a solution that sidesteps the 2D visualisation step which is present in every design process, so users can think in 3D and create in 3D. It&#8217;s sort of like a Zoom meeting in 3D, helping everyone understand the yet to be materialised product from their own vantage point.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/nrgeXJ-wK-Q?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, content created in Gravity Sketch can further the design pipeline, meaning there is no need to create different views of a design or have to create a 3D model in another tool. Gravity Sketch designs can be exported to almost all of the CAD tools on the market with a claimed 100% accuracy.<\/p>\n<p>It seems to be resonating, too, with some of the world\u2019s leading companies, such as Ford, Nissan and Reebok using Gravity Sketch, alongside 60 universities and over 50,000 creative professionals worldwide.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Gravity Sketch says the new funding will enable the company to scale up the platform to become &#8220;entirely hardware-agnostic.&#8221; It currently works with a range of virtual reality hardware, and is in beta for iPad, mobile and desktop.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Gravity Sketch, the London-based product design and collaboration platform that utilises virtual reality, has raised $3.7 million in funding.

Initially, the VC firm has $65 million in deployable &#8212; so called &#8212; patient capital.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;We like to invest across the broad areas of deep tech, digital health and personalised healthcare,&#8221; Pathiraja tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We prefer technology solutions that make the lives of patients easier and better and, in some cases, that help support people&#8217;s health before they become patients. Part of our remit is also for tech solutions within the healthcare industry that improve efficiency and productivity of providers.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Alongside the main fund, CGV is also unveiling Crista Galli LABS, which, in part, aims for greater diversity in health tech by backing founders from underrepresented backgrounds at the pre-seed stage. In addition to pre-seed investment, startups accepted into the program have access to mentoring and coaching from the CGV team.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When I was in hospital, there were people from all backgrounds there and this was the norm&#8230; [but] this really wasn\u2019t my experience when I started investing,&#8221; explains Pathiraja. &#8220;I am struck by how homogeneous both founder teams and investment teams can be.

U.K.-based virtual healthcare provider that, in its own words, is &#8220;reimagining&#8221; the outpatient system, is disclosing \u00a310 million in new funding.<\/p>\n<p>The round was led by private investment firm Nickleby Capital, and will be used to grow the team and invest in technology to &#8220;service new contracts, enable new product development and ensure scalable and robust growth&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Founded in 2013 by NHS consultant Dr Bahman Nedjat-Shokouhi, and launched the following year, Medefer is a CQC regulated healthcare provider that has developed a digital platform that connects GPs, consultants, and patients, with the aim of delivering a more efficient outpatient system.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Described as an &#8220;outpatient operating system&#8221; coupled with a nationwide network of contracted NHS consultants working remotely, Medefer claims to manage the patient pathway &#8212; from referral to triage to investigation, diagnosis and discharge &#8212; without the need for unnecessary physical outpatient appointments.<\/p>\n<p>Headline features include cases being reviewed by NHS consultants within 10 hours on average, compared to several weeks using traditional models. For NHS Trusts and CCGs using Medefer, the company claims that outpatient costs are cut by a third, and waiting lists reduced by 70%, in part due to being able to remove duplication in consultations, such as seeing a consultant only to be told that a test or scan is needed first.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"VfZX8ZKp8F\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/12\/where-top-vcs-are-investing-in-healthcare-b2b-and-infrastructure\/\">Where top VCs are investing in healthcare B2B and infrastructure<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Where top VCs are investing in healthcare B2B and infrastructure&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/12\/where-top-vcs-are-investing-in-healthcare-b2b-and-infrastructure\/embed\/#?secret=VfZX8ZKp8F\" data-secret=\"VfZX8ZKp8F\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>That&#8217;s likely an oversimplification, yet anyone who has gone through the outpatient referral journey will know there are often inefficiencies simply due to non-optimal information sharing and an inflexible patient journey.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The outpatient model has not changed since before the inception of the NHS, and has significant inefficiencies,&#8221; says Nedjat-Shokouhi. &#8220;With increasing patient numbers, the inefficiencies have resulted in growing waiting lists, and of course this has been significantly worsened by the pandemic&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>This has seen many healthcare providers going &#8216;digital&#8217; and setting up video consultations instead of face-to-face consultations.

to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mourocapital.com\/\">Mouro Capital<\/a>. It will continue to be headed up by general partner Manuel Silva Marti\u0301nez, who joined InnoVentures five years ago and has led the fund since 2018, and senior advisor Chris Gottschalk, who joined from Blumberg Capital last year.<\/p>\n<p>Noteworthy, despite its new-found independence, Santander will remain <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/santander-innoventures\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"santander-innoventures\">Mouro Capital&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> sole investor\/LP, including doubling its current commitment, seeing the VC have $400 million in allotted funds.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>However, my understanding is that by being managed autonomously from the multinational bank, Mouro will be able to invest more nimbly, including placing bets adjacent to pure fintech or financial services and in startups that could more directly compete with Santander&#8217;s own product lines. It should also help remove any market perception that portfolio companies aren&#8217;t independent of the incumbent bank, in terms of future investment or partnerships with Santander competitors.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Santander InnoVentures was an early backer of a number of so-called unicorns (companies valued at more than a billion dollars). They include Ripple, Tradeshift and Upgrade. It has seen a number of exits, too, including <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/17\/paypal-confirms-that-it-is-buying-payments-startup-izettle-for-2-2b-in-an-all-cash-deal\/\">iZettle to PayPal in 2018<\/a> for $2 billion, and Kabbage, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/17\/amex-acquires-softbank-backed-kabbage-after-tough-2020-for-the-smb-lender\/\">acquired<\/a> by Amex last month.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/santander-innoventures\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"santander-innoventures\">Mouro Capital <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> aims to bring its fintech expertise, global network and strong track record in successful investments to early and growth-stage startups globally. The fund will continue to deploy capital across Europe and the Americas, primarily leading investment rounds with initial investments of up to $15 million and further follow-on reserves,&#8221; says Santander.<\/p>\n<p>I put written questions to Mouro Capital general partner Manuel Silva Marti\u0301nez to find out more. The following Q&amp;A has been lightly edited.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TechCrunch: What does this enable the fund to do that it couldn&#8217;t already? Does its independence enable it to be more aggressive with investing in products that could compete directly with Santander&#8217;s own services and products? Or it is more about speed in relation to the investment committee making quicker decisions?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Manuel Silva Marti\u0301nez: Santander InnoVentures was fairly optimized as a corporate venture capital fund in terms of operations and speed of investment. However, the evolution into the Mouro Capital structure allows for extra alignment with entrepreneurs and co-investors (their success being the #1 objective), even faster\/nimbler processes, and potentially a bolder investment strategy within the themes and investment policy agreed with our Limited Partner.<\/p>\n<p>Shifting to a separate brand also reduces any potential affiliation that entrepreneurs may fear as potentially conflicting (commercially, IP), further reassured by a cleaner legal separation. On the change of the investment policy point, indeed Mouro will deploy a bolder investment strategy, that may involve investing in perceived competitors (which has been done in the past, e.g. neobank Klar in Mexico, lender Creditas in Brazil, or Curve in the UK), but this still fits into the logic that, if a venture capital affiliated with an industrial player should be a lighthouse for the &#8216;industry to come&#8217;, investing in emerging competitors that may reshape the future\/long-term competitive landscape is just as aligned as any other topic.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to that, Mouro will also explore the &#8216;boundaries&#8217; of financial services, so you can expect to see Mouro invest from time to time in areas such as proptech, mobility, logistics, edtech, etc.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How big is the current team in terms of investment members and other support? And how is this going to change going forward? i.e. further operational\/portfolio support or new investment partner members, etc.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The current investment team has six members, with the Finance, Legal\/Compliance and Communications also internalised (so, extra three people). The team will indeed grow. Still early to say, but we would expect the investment team to add another 3-4 professionals with backgrounds aligned with our values (fintech expertise, entrepreneurial\/operational expertise, exposure to specific networks we are interested in, esp. in Europe).<\/p>\n<p>In addition to that, we will be building a &#8216;business development&#8217; and operations support team to assist our companies with their growth needs and also with building mutually beneficial relationships with Santander and across the portfolio.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Aside from being broadly fintech\/financial services focused, perhaps you can share a bit more on the Mouro thesis going forward.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As you say, we take a very broad view to the future of financial services, looking even beyond today\u2019s industry boundaries. We ask ourselves fundamental questions and build strong theses around topics we are passionate about while keeping an open mind to new ideas that challenge our beliefs. In a way, we operate along three horizons that are complementary in addressing different angles of where we see the industry going:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the short term, we invest in technologies that allow incumbents to make the transition into digital through better processes. Questions like: how can we bring automation and real-time applications into banking infrastructure? How can we build richer data ecosystems? What new client value propositions are emerging in developed and developing markets? How can banking services be delivered through APIs? How can finance be embedded in third-party journeys?<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>There are also companies that have superior capabilities (technology, data science, installed capacity) that, combined with banks or other startups, could build new businesses or re-engineer businesses from scratch. Questions like: how are novel technologies and new engineering paradigms (artificial intelligence, blockchain, quantum computing) changing how banks work? What emerging enterprise software utilities and platforms will be the gateway to tomorrow\u2019s financial services? This is about building new businesses within the status quo of today&#8217;s industry by lining up the right resources and players.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>More for the long term, we also look at how the industry is meant to evolve and reinvent itself, potentially by even transcending itself and crossing over with other industries to create new white-spaces. Questions like: how can industries be more integrated and converge into new white spaces fueled by finance?

This scenario is exactly where human bias enters into the process.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>In addition, on the applicant side, Lonij notes that the overwhelming majority of job candidates want to receive feedback from their time-consuming job interviews, &#8220;yet only 41% receive it, hindering their ability to learn and grow.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>To solve this, the Swyg platform puts candidates through an interview process that sees them interview each other through a series of one-to-one video chats using pre-defined structured questions.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The peer-to-peer process draws on the expertise of a diverse group of individuals instead of relying on a single recruiter or hiring manager,&#8221; explains the Swyg founder. &#8220;Simply getting input from more diverse reviewers already reduces bias.&#8221; In addition, Swyg\u2019s AI technology claims to be able to calibrate peer-interviewers in real time &#8220;to detect and correct bias and human error.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2042780\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2042780\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2042780\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Swyg-Interviewer-Shot-1.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"356\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Swyg-Interviewer-Shot-1.png 1333w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Swyg-Interviewer-Shot-1.png?resize=150,79 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Swyg-Interviewer-Shot-1.png?resize=300,157 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Swyg-Interviewer-Shot-1.png?resize=768,402 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Swyg-Interviewer-Shot-1.png?resize=680,356 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Swyg-Interviewer-Shot-1.png?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2042780\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Swyg<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>One way to think about it is that to understand the interviewee and how they performed in the interview, first Swyg needs to understand more about the interviewer. This could include taking into account how they score candidates in aggregate (i.e. are they more positive or more negative in their scores) and other variables, such as if they are inclined to be a tougher judge following a high score and vice versa or if they remain fairly consistent.<\/p>\n<p>There are also systems in place to detect when something unexpected happens, including participants deliberately giving unfair ratings. This triggers a review process where Swyg can exclude certain reviews if it is warranted.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In a nutshell, we use machine learning to understand the interviewers that in turn understand the interviewees, as opposed to trying to judge candidates directly with AI\/ML,&#8221; explains Lonij. &#8220;We\u2019re able to use this technology to detect and correct for known cognitive biases of the interviewers, which leads to more accurate assessments.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Lonij says that everyone else is trying to solve the candidate selection problem using fully automated solutions or fully manual solutions. &#8220;Neither of these will work,&#8221; he argues.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s because AI in general is not developed enough to be able to judge humans in a fully automated way, resulting in CV keyword matching or automated analysis of recorded videos being extremely unreliable. In turn, human interviewers alone are error prone and subject to a range of biases.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are different because of our hybrid approach,&#8221; adds Lonij. &#8220;By making candidates part of the process we can take advantage of the best parts of human integrity and adaptability while also getting the efficiency of AI.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Swyg, a Dublin-based startup that believes it can reduce bias in recruitment by combining a peer-interview process with its own AI, has picked up $1.2 million in pre-seed funding.

That [means]&#8230; we can reduce the demand on our scarce dermatology resources, freeing them up to focus on other patients such as the inflammatory skin disease patients who often wait months for appointments. We can also reduce the cost of skin cancer, freeing up that money to be reassigned to improving care elsewhere.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Because skin cancer is such a large problem, coupled with advances in AI, Daly notes that there were initially many companies working in this space, seeing an explosion of competitors in 2014 with around 50 companies in the field. &#8220;All but three or four are gone now as the reality of how complex the technology is and how challenging operating as a clinical company hits home,&#8221; he says, before adding that there appears to be another wave of competitors surfacing.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In reality, we&#8217;ve spent so much time learning from our mistakes in developing our AI, this is one of our main points of difference,&#8221; cautions the Skin Analytics founder. &#8220;It is too easy to get started and think you&#8217;ve made a great algorithm, but when you test it in the real world &#8212; and you can only do this with a prospective clinical study &#8212; the performance just isn&#8217;t there. Not only have we done that, but we use our research strategy to ask questions that give us the data to continue to improve our algorithms. There is no shortcut for this, you need to test, improve and repeat.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Another key differentiator is that you can&#8217;t &#8216;fake it until you make it&#8217; in a highly regulated industry and the processes that come with that. &#8220;You have to build them into the fabric of your company and it&#8217;s slow and painful,&#8221; adds Daly. &#8220;Medical device companies have to find a way to innovate quickly within a safety critical environment and I&#8217;m very proud of the way our team has built that ability, and continues to do so.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Skin Analytics, a U.K.-based startup that has developed a skin cancer screening service that uses artificial intelligence, has raised \u00a34 million in Series A funding.

understands that Chris Sing, Revolut&#8217;s head of regulatory compliance is leaving to take up the position as Barclays&#8217;s new chief of staff to the group chief compliance officer. He joined Revolut in December 2018 and has spent a little under two years at the multi-unicorn fintech.<\/p>\n<p>In a gamekeeper-turned-poacher styled career move, prior to Revolut, Sing was a manager at U.K. regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). During his long stint at the FCA, he also did a secondment at incumbent bank Santander.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Revolut have confirmed Sing&#8217;s departure, whose direct responsibilities are being taken on by group head of compliance assurance, Harinder Gill, until a replacement is recruited.<\/p>\n<p>Noteworthy, though not surprising given that Revolut is no longer an early-stage startup, Sing adds to a number of senior staff that have departed in recent months. Most high profile is Richard Davies, CEO Bankng, who left to join Allica Bank as CEO. Another is Andre Muhammad, head of trading &#8212; destination unknown (although <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/01\/10\/revolut-hire-freetrade-co-founder-and-former-cto-as-head-of-wealth-trading-product\/\">we can be sure it isn&#8217;t Freetrade<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Revolut is on the verge of announcing two senior hires from <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/amazon\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"amazon\">Amazon, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> TechCrunch has learned.
