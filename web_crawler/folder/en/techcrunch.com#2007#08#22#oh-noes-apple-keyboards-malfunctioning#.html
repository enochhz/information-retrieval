target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"madrid\">Madrid <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> second, but the gap appears to close every year. Barcelona has benefitted from attracting expats in search of sun, beach and lifestyle who tend to produce more internationally minded startups.<\/p>\n<p>Madrid&#8217;s startups have predominantly been Spain or Latin America-focused, but have become increasingly international in nature. Although not part of this survey, we expect Valencia to join next year, as city authorities have been going all-out to attract entrepreneurs and investors.<\/p>\n<p>The overall Spanish ecosystem is generally less mature than those in the U.K., France, Sweden and Germany, but it has been improving at a fast clip. More recently, entrepreneurs in Spain have moved away from emulating success in pursuit of innovative technologies.<\/p>\n<p>Following the financial crisis, the Spanish government supported the creation of startups with the launch of FOND-ICO GLOBAL, a \u20ac1.5 billion fund-of-funds in 2017, which put \u20ac800 million into the market that year. Three years later, the fastest-moving sector is tech. In 2018, Spain counted 4,115 active startups, <a href=\"https:\/\/150sec.com\/the-evolution-of-the-startup-ecosystem-in-spain\/12338\/\">reported 150sec<\/a>. Barcelona has seen a boom in startups and support systems, with companies based there raising \u20ac2.7 billion between 2015 and 2019, almost doubling Madrid\u2019s figure (according to Dealroom).<\/p>\n<p>In the first half of a two-part survey that asks 18 Spain-based startup investors about the trends they&#8217;re tracking, we reached out to the following VCs:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/marta-gaia-zanchi\">Marta-Gaia Zanchi<\/a>, managing partner, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nina.capital\">Nina Capital<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/marta-antunez\">Marta Antunez<\/a>, director, Wayra Barcelona<\/li>\n<li>Jaime Novoa, associate, <a href=\"http:\/\/kfund.vc\/\">K Fund<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/andy-areitio\">Andy Areitio<\/a>, partner, <a href=\"https:\/\/theventure.city\/\">TheVentureCity<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/christophe-primault\">Christophe Primault<\/a>, partner, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elaia.com\/\">Elaia<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/luis-gutierrez\">Luis Guti\u00e9rrez Roy<\/a>, managing partner, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thcap.com\">Telegraph Hill Capital<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Santiago Reyna, founding partner, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.keith.vc\/en\/home-en\/\">Keith Ventures<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/carlos-trenchs-sainz-de-la-maza\">Carlos Trenchs Sainz de la Maza<\/a>, founding partner, Aldea Ventures<\/li>\n<li>Jordi Vinas, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/nauta-capital\">Nauta Capital<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Marta-Gaia Zanchi, managing partner, Nina Capital<\/h2>\n<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?<\/strong><br \/>\nInfrastructural needs of the healthcare industry.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don\u2019t?

What other types of products\/services are you wary or concerned about?<\/strong><br \/>\nTelemedicine.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general?

After all, it&#8217;s Barcelona. Regarding the investment climate in particular, I believe too few international investors appreciate the full spectrum and significance of the opportunities that this city affords for starting and scaling a company.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?<\/strong><br \/>\nNot really. I think most companies will continue to have HQs in the major hubs, but their teams are going to be more distributed. And hubs that were traditionally at disadvantage over the usual suspects will find themselves less so.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?<\/strong><br \/>\nWe are specialized healthtech investors. All our investments to date are B2B companies selling to healthcare organizations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio?

Only Class A shares will trade, and Class B and F shares are convertible to Class A shares on a one-to-one basis.

The vehicle marks a series of firsts for Ford and the Mustang badge. It\u2019s the first\u00a0vehicle to come out of Team Edison, the automaker\u2019s dedicated electric vehicle organization.

Many people are using their cars less frequently because they are working remotely or there are movement restrictions where they live. When they do go out, electric bikes and scooters offer an alternative to public transportation and ride-hailing services for short trips.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Neuron Mobility\u2019s chief executive Zachary Wang said the company raised a Series A+ instead of moving onto a Series B because more cities are &#8220;opening up to the possibility of micromobility, particularly rental e-scooters as they present an individual transport option that takes pressure off public transport and allows people to continue social distancing.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ve been experiencing tremendous growth in ANZ and the pandemic has made us fast track our plans,&#8221; he added.<\/p>\n<p>Though Neuron Mobility currently does not operate in other Southeast Asian countries besides Singapore, Wang said it is &#8220;constantly evaluating opportunities across APAC.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The new funding will be used to speed up Neuron Mobility\u2019s expansion plans in Australia and New Zealand, where it claims to be the leading electric scooter rental operator. The company is currently present in nine locations, including Auckland, New Zealand, and Australian cities Adelaide, Brisbane, Darwin, Canberra and Townsville. Neuron Mobility plans to expand into five new cities over the next 12 months and part of that involves hiring 400 more people in Australia, New Zealand and Singapore. In addition to the Asia-Pacific, Neuron Mobility will also launch in Slough, it\u2019s first location in the United Kingdom, by the end of this year.<\/p>\n<p>Neuron Mobility\u2019s research found that before the COVID-19 lockdowns in Australia, one in five of its users had never used an e-scooter before. But now Australian and New Zealand users have increased their average e-scooter trip distances by 23% to 2.6 kilometers, with the average duration of rides rising by 10% to more than 14 minutes. Neuron Mobility\u2019s pricing is meant to be affordable depending on different markets. For example, in Brisbane, users pay one Australian dollar (about 68 U.S. cents) to begin a trip and then 38 Australian cents for each minute of the ride. Its e-scooters can go up to speeds of about 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) per hour.<\/p>\n<p>Other &#8220;micromobility&#8221; companies, including Ofo, Reddy Go, Obike and Lime, have also offered rental services in Australia and New Zealand, but ran into trouble. Bike-sharing startups Ofo, Reddy Go and Obike <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com.au\/bike-sharing-industry-end-australia-2018-7\">withdrew from Australia<\/a> in part because city councils were frustrated by bikes were being abandoned on sidewalks and in parks. Lime still operates in Australian cities, but in June, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/lime-failed-disclose-scooter-safety-issues-accidents-2020-6\">found that the company failed to disclose safety issues<\/a> with its Generation 2 scooters (in response, Lime said it would implement new compliance procedures and upgrade to its new Generation 3 scooter).<\/p>\n<p>Wang said Neuron Mobility avoids those issues by strategically planning which cities it will launch in, instead of focusing on rapid expansion, partnering with city councils and &#8220;continually shifting and adapting to meet their needs.&#8221; Several of Neuron Mobility\u2019s features, including geofencing to control where and how fast e-scooters can be ridden, and a \u201cHelmet Lock\u201d to make helmets available for all scooters, were developed after discussions with city councils. Neuron Mobility\u2019s scooters, designed by the company specifically for renting, also use swappable batteries to decrease pollution.<\/p>\n<p>After launching in Singapore, Neuron Mobility decided to focus on Australia and New Zealand because &#8220;both countries have cities that are highly suitable for micromobility in terms of infrastructure and regulations,&#8221; Wang said.
