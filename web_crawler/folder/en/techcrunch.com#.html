href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2020\/10\/taking-legal-action-against-data-scraping\/\">it has filed a lawsuit<\/a> in the U.S. against two companies that had engaged in an international &#8220;data scraping&#8221; operation. The operation extended across Facebook properties, including both Facebook and Instagram, as well as other large websites and services, including Twitter, Amazon, LinkedIn and YouTube. The companies, who gathered the data of Facebook users for &#8220;marketing intelligence&#8221; purposes, did so in violation of Facebook&#8217;s Terms of Service, says Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>The businesses named in the lawsuits are Israeli-based BrandTotal Ltd. and Unimania Inc., a business incorporated in Delaware.<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brandtotal.com\/\">BrandTotal&#8217;s<\/a> website, its company offers a real-time competitive intelligence platform that&#8217;s designed to give media, insights and analytics teams visibility into their competition&#8217;s social media strategy and paid campaigns. These insights would allow its customers to analyze and shift their budget allocation to target new opportunities, monitor trends and threats from emerging brands, optimize their ads and messaging, and more.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Meanwhile, Unimania operated apps claimed to offer users the ability to access social networks in different ways. For example, Unimania offered apps that let you view Facebook via a mobile-web interface or alongside other social networks like Twitter. Another app let you view Instagram Stories anonymously, it claimed.<\/p>\n<p>However, Facebook&#8217;s lawsuit is largely focused on two browser extensions offered by the companies: Unimania&#8217;s<a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/ads-feed\/deciloopcooglpjhomblbbjeeenohbpg?hl=en\">\u00a0&#8220;Ads Feed<\/a>&#8221; and BrandTotal&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/upvoice\/bmngkajcejghcgafbobemkpjboikmgfi?hl=en\">UpVoice<\/a>.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The former allowed users to save the ads they saw on Facebook for later reference. But as the extension&#8217;s page discloses, doing so would opt users into a panel that informed the advertising decisions of Unimania&#8217;s corporate customers. UpVote, on the other hand, rewarded users with gift cards for using top social networking and shopping sites and sharing their opinions about the online campaigns run by big brands.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook says these extensions operated in violation of its protections against scraping and its terms of service. When users installed the extensions and visited Facebook websites, the extensions installed automated programs to scrape their name, user ID, gender, date of birth, relationship status, location information, and other information related to their accounts. The data was then sent to a server shared by BrandTotal and Unimania.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; display: block;\"><a style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" title=\"View Facebook lawsuit vs BrandTotal Ltd. and Unimania Inc. on Scribd\" href=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/document\/478333898\/Facebook-lawsuit-vs-BrandTotal-Ltd-and-Unimania-Inc#from_embed\">Facebook lawsuit vs BrandTotal Ltd. and Unimania Inc.<\/a> by <a style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" title=\"View TechCrunch's profile on Scribd\" href=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/publisher\/17551504\/TechCrunch#from_embed\">TechCrunch<\/a> on Scribd<\/p>\n<p><iframe id=\"doc_36050\" class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" title=\"Facebook lawsuit vs BrandTotal Ltd. and Unimania Inc.\" src=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/embeds\/478333898\/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;access_key=key-WF2ETdCfBtOhKRJqsiDN\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" data-auto-height=\"false\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.75\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Data scrapers exist in part to collect as much information as they can through any means possible using automated tools, like bots and scripts. Cambridge Analytica infamously <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/22\/facebook-staff-raised-concerns-about-cambridge-analytica-in-september-2015-per-court-filing\/\">scraped millions of Facebook profiles<\/a> in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election in order to target undecided voters. Other data scraping operations use bots to monitor concert or event ticket prices in order to undercut competitors. Scraped data can also be used for marketing and advertising, or simply sold on to others.<\/p>\n<p>In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook has begun to pursue legal action against various developers that break its terms of service.<\/p>\n<p>Most cases involving data scraping are litigated under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, written in the 1980s to prosecute computer hacking cases. Anyone who <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eff.org\/deeplinks\/2019\/09\/victory-ruling-hiq-v-linkedin-protects-scraping-public-data\">accesses a computer &#8220;without authorization&#8221;<\/a> can face hefty fines or even prison time.<\/p>\n<p>But because the law doesn&#8217;t specifically define what &#8220;authorized&#8221; access is and what isn&#8217;t, tech giants have seen mixed results in their efforts to shut down data scrapers.<\/p>\n<p>LinkedIn <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en\/article\/9kek83\/linkedin-data-scraping-lawsuit-shot-down\">lost<\/a> its high-profile case against HiQ Labs in 2019 after an appeals court ruled that the scraper was only collecting data that was publicly available from the internet. Internet rights groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eff.org\/deeplinks\/2019\/09\/victory-ruling-hiq-v-linkedin-protects-scraping-public-data\">lauded the decision<\/a>, arguing that internet users should not face legal threats &#8220;simply for accessing publicly available information in a way that publishers object to.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Facebook&#8217;s latest legal case is slightly different because the company is accusing BrandTotal of scraping Facebook profile data that wasn&#8217;t inherently public. Facebook says the accused data scraper used a browser extension installed on users&#8217; computers to gain access to their Facebook profile data.<\/p>\n<p>In March 2019, it took action against two Ukrainian developers who were harvesting data using quiz apps and browser extensions to scrape profile information and people\u2019s friends lists, Facebook says. A court in California recently <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Browser-Extension-Case.pdf\">recommended<\/a> a judgement in Facebook&#8217;s favor in the case. A separate <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/STACKLA.pdf\">case<\/a> around scraping filed last year against a marketing partner Stackla\u00a0 also came back in Facebook&#8217;s favor.<\/p>\n<p>This year, Facebook <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2020\/08\/taking-legal-action-against-those-who-abuse-our-platform\/\">filed lawsuits<\/a> against <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/27\/facebook-sues-developers-who-violated-terms-to-collect-user-data-sell-fake-likes\/\">companies<\/a> and individuals engaged in both scraping and fake engagement services.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook isn&#8217;t just cracking down on data scraping businesses to protect user privacy, however. It&#8217;s because failing to do so can lead to large fines. Facebook at the beginning of this year was <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/29\/facebook-will-pay-550-million-to-settle-class-action-lawsuit-over-privacy-violations\/\">ordered<\/a> to pay out over half a billion dollars to settle a class action lawsuit that alleged systemic violation of an Illinois privacy law. Last year, it <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/24\/facebook-settles-with-ftc-5-billion-and-new-privacy-guarantees\/\">settled with the FTC over privacy lapses<\/a> and had to pay a $5 billion penalty. As governments work to further regulation online privacy and data violations, fines like this could add up.<\/p>\n<p>The company says legal action isn&#8217;t the only way it&#8217;s working to stop data scraping. It has also invested in technical teams and tools to monitor and detect suspicious activity and the use of of unauthorized automation for scraping, it says.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Facebook today says it has filed a lawsuit in the U.S. against two companies that had engaged in an international &#8220;data scraping&#8221; operation.

Thursday to move forward<\/a> with subpoenas for Twitter&#8217;s Jack Dorsey, Facebook&#8217;s Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet. The unusual decision to subpoena the social media chief executives adds yet another politically volatile event to the schedule in the run-up to the most contentious election in modern U.S. history.<\/p>\n<p>The hearing will focus on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eff.org\/issues\/cda230\">Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act<\/a>, the key law that shields online platforms from legal liability for the content their users create.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>While the topic might sound dry for the unacquainted, the law is an explosive topic, both politically and in the eyes of the tech industry, which <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/08\/23\/the-consequences-of-indecency\/\">could be left reeling<\/a> from even what might seem like minor changes to the legal shield.<\/p>\n<p>Committee Chairman Roger Wicker called the decision to hold the hearing &#8220;imperative&#8221; in order for Americans to &#8220;receive a full accounting from the heads of these companies about their content moderation practices.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Remarkably, the decision to subpoena the CEOs was unanimous, with ranking Democrat Maria Cantwell joining the vote to subpoena the companies after initially opposing the decision.<\/p>\n<p>Cantwell <a href=\"https:\/\/thehill.com\/policy\/technology\/518109-key-democrat-opposes-gop-section-230-subpoena-for-facebook-twitter-google\">previously<\/a> called the idea of issuing subpoenas an &#8220;extraordinary&#8221; step intended to &#8220;chill the efforts&#8221; of companies to remove misinformation and harassment from their platforms.<\/p>\n<p>Republican members of the Senate Commerce Committee include its Wicker, Ted Cruz, John Thune and Rick Scott. Democrats on the committee include Cantwell, Amy Klobuchar, Brian Schatz, and Kyrsten Sinema.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"XARKz7Hgsk\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/08\/23\/the-consequences-of-indecency\/\">The consequences of indecency<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;The consequences of indecency&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/08\/23\/the-consequences-of-indecency\/embed\/#?secret=XARKz7Hgsk\" data-secret=\"XARKz7Hgsk\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h3>What&#8217;s going on with Section 230?<\/h3>\n<p>Section 230 is generally regarded as the legal infrastructure that made the social internet possible, from Facebook accounts and comments sections to Yelp and Amazon reviews.

Earlier this year, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/28\/trump-twitter-executive-order-social-media\/\">Trump lashed out at Twitter<\/a> for moderating his false claims with an executive order threatening the law. While the order was largely toothless, Trump&#8217;s focus on Section 230 set the agenda for the Barr&#8217;s Department of Justice and for Republicans in Congress eager to follow his lead. The order also<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/03\/fcc-invites-public-comment-on-trumps-attempt-to-nerf-section-230\/\"> roped the FCC into getting involved<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"YEEzBdhhin\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/28\/trump-social-media-executive-order\/\">Trump signs an executive order taking direct aim at social media companies<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Trump signs an executive order taking direct aim at social media companies&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/28\/trump-social-media-executive-order\/embed\/#?secret=YEEzBdhhin\" data-secret=\"YEEzBdhhin\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>In June, the Justice Department <a href=\"https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/opa\/pr\/justice-department-issues-recommendations-section-230-reform\">laid out a groundwork<\/a> for &#8220;a set of concrete reform proposals&#8221; that would undermine the law, couching the proposal as an effort to rid platforms of &#8220;illicit content&#8221; like child abuse.

On Monday, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong wrote a company blog post titled &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.coinbase.com\/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804\">Coinbase is a mission focused company<\/a>&#8221; which drew both praise and critique that has continued throughout the week. Personally, I wasn\u2019t terribly impressed.<\/p>\n<p>I limited my reaction on Twitter to one retweet, a couple of replies and some likes. But on Tuesday, a journalist asked if I had any comment to contribute to a piece she\u2019s writing on the matter, so I tried to articulate a comment in one or two lines. The next thousand-ish words is what I ended up with.<\/p>\n<p>This is such a sensitive, nuanced and personal topic, and I wouldn\u2019t want to be irresponsible by making a quick off-handed remark or not taking enough into consideration.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>However, I think it\u2019s so important, it\u2019d be irresponsible <strong>not <\/strong>to say something when asked.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d like to think I understood the intent \u2014 that Brian wants to ensure that <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/coinbase\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"coinbase\">Coinbase <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> is inclusive of people who hold different views than what\u2019s assumed to be progressive in the tech sector (or elsewhere) and avoid creating a workplace that is divided and too &#8220;distracted&#8221; (his word) by political causes or social activism.<\/p>\n<p>However, what he\u2019s really only done is highlight his tremendous position of privilege. Privilege doesn\u2019t mean that he hasn\u2019t struggled or hasn\u2019t worked hard at being CEO of his company or in life. It simply means he thinks social activism can be a \u201cdistraction.&#8221; It means he thinks it\u2019s a distraction to think about human rights and whether what\u2019s happening around us is just or not.<\/p>\n<p>It means he doesn&#8217;t wake up worrying about how institutional racism or systemic oppression might affect him. It means he doesn\u2019t relate to the feeling that he could be the next driver to be unjustifiably stopped and searched, asked to get out of his car (or worse) for a broken taillight or verbally ridiculed or assaulted for someone else\u2019s assumptions about his sexual orientation. It means he doesn\u2019t think the rise of white supremacy in America is going to affect or diminish his ability to \u201cstay focused\u201d on his company\u2019s mission. It means he doesn\u2019t have to go to work wondering if he\u2019ll be pushed aside, undermined or spoken over by a male colleague.<\/p>\n<p>Brian\u2019s statement made me think back to conversations I had with some friends over the summer who said they weren\u2019t going to watch \u201cevery single video\u201d of police brutality in the U.S. relating to the Black Lives Matter protests. It\u2019s possible that I was watching too much because it was only increasing my frustration and feelings of powerlessness to help or change things, but I also realized that my friends admitting that they\u2019d stopped watching each new video was a luxury and a privilege for them.<\/p>\n<p>They didn\u2019t have to watch them \u2014 no one is required to \u2014 but they were able to switch off because the injustice and inequity of it all doesn\u2019t burn in their minds. It doesn\u2019t affect them personally. It doesn\u2019t impact how they walk down the street or conduct themselves around law enforcement. They have the privilege of not ever imagining or worrying if the victims of police brutality happened to be their family or close friends or even people they might know.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/brian-armstrong\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"brian-armstrong\">Brian Armstrong\u2019s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> call to not engage in political discourse via his platform and his position as a leader is a privilege whilst others are compelled out of concern and fear to speak up for themselves, others, and those who have softer or even no voices.<\/p>\n<p>In the memo, he takes time to reiterate the fact that the company will \u201cfocus on the things that help us achieve our mission,\u201d including sourcing job candidates from underrepresented backgrounds, reducing unconscious bias and fostering an environment where everyone is welcome regardless of background, sexual orientation, race, gender, age, etc. While I\u2018m glad to see him recognize these areas of focus, immediately after that section he goes on to say that <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/coinbase\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"coinbase\">Coinbase <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> won\u2019t engage on \u201cbroader societal issues\u201d or advocacy for political causes. From where does he think the first set of principles emerged?!?<\/p>\n<p>It seems outlandish to have to establish this, but it wasn\u2019t always the case that sexual orientation, race, gender or age were awarded equal treatment in employment law. It was in my lifetime that women could be fired from work for being pregnant. It is precisely engaging in \u201cbroader societal issues\u201d that brought about those points of legal fairness and equality \u2014 and those are incredibly vulnerable right now. How dare he say he\u2019s willing to embrace and stand for what\u2019s been established so far, but that there\u2019s no reason to engage any further? What that tells me is that as far as he\u2019s concerned, the debates and activism to date have achieved enough and the rest, now, is distraction.<\/p>\n<p>That. Is. Privilege.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously, I know Coinbase is Brian\u2019s company, and therefore it\u2019s fully his prerogative to lay out the \u201cmission\u201d and rules as he sees fit. But what bothers me is that he and others who are feeling emboldened to say they agree or even commend him for \u201cbeing brave\u201d enough for saying so won\u2019t realize the extent of their privilege and may inadvertently walk back so much recent progress and positive dialogue in the tech sector and business more broadly. We\u2019ve seen so much evidence in recent years that consumers and purchasing power gravitate toward brands and companies that articulate what they stand for.<\/p>\n<p>No longer is it enough for brands to be likable or just upbeat. Their silence on social injustices is deafening. Their association with individuals who either contribute to or enable racism or oppression of people and groups is enough for customers to think twice about using them. Their public support of activism and human rights either in merchandise or TV advertisements drives up their stock price. As more and more products and services are increasingly commoditized, consumers have sought to align themselves with brands and products that reflect their ethos.<\/p>\n<p>It was a free pass for too long for businesses and their leaders to say that they didn\u2019t wade into politics. In recent years, for example, because of the U.K.-EU Brexit referendum, the 2016 U.S. presidential election, or other occasions, companies and brand values have been drawn out and exposed for good or bad. It would be a shame for consumers and all stakeholders to lose that trend.<\/p>\n<p>I hope that investor shareholders and employees of companies where leaders might be asserting similar views of not wanting to get \u201cdistracted\u201d by social action will help to demonstrate just how much impact can be achieved by dialogue and action.<\/p>\n<p>People do their best work and form championship

In spite of that, Oracle founder and chief technology officer Larry Ellison gushed in<a href=\"https:\/\/www.oracle.com\/news\/announcement\/oracle-chosen-as-tiktok-secure-cloud-provider-091920.html\"> a September 19 press release<\/a> about how TikTok had &#8220;chosen&#8221; his company&#8217;s cloud infrastructure service. The statement also indicated that this &#8220;choice&#8221; was influenced by Zoom&#8217;s decision to move <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/28\/in-surprise-choice-zoom-hitches-wagon-to-oracle-for-growing-infrastructure-needs\/\">some percentage of its workloads<\/a> to Oracle&#8217;s infrastructure cloud earlier this year.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"qc4TYorQD1\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/28\/in-surprise-choice-zoom-hitches-wagon-to-oracle-for-growing-infrastructure-needs\/\">In surprise choice, Zoom partners with Oracle for growing infrastructure needs<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;In surprise choice, Zoom partners with Oracle for growing infrastructure needs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/28\/in-surprise-choice-zoom-hitches-wagon-to-oracle-for-growing-infrastructure-needs\/embed\/#?secret=qc4TYorQD1\" data-secret=\"qc4TYorQD1\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The mechanics of the TikTok deal aside, the question is how big an effect will these two customers have on the company&#8217;s overall cloud infrastructure market share. We asked a couple of firms who closely watch all things cloud.<\/p>\n<p>John Dinsdale, chief analyst at Synergy Research Group, wasn&#8217;t terribly optimistic that they would have much material impact on moving the market share needle for the database giant. &#8220;<a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/oracle\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"oracle\">Oracle\u2019s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> cloud infrastructure services growth has been consistently below overall IaaS and PaaS market growth rates so its market share has [actually] been nudging downward. Zoom may be a good win but it is unlikely to move the needle too much &#8212; and remember <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/zoom-video-communications\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"zoom-video-communications\">Zoom <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> also buys cloud services from AWS,&#8221; Dinsdale told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>As for TikTok, Dinsdale, like the rest of us, wasn&#8217;t clear how that deal would ultimately play out, but he says even with both companies in the fold, it wasn&#8217;t going to shift market share as much as Oracle might hope. &#8220;Hypothetically, even if Zoom\/TikTok helped Oracle increase its cloud infrastructure service revenues 50% over 12 months, which would be a real stretch, its market share would still be nearer to 2% than 3%. This compares with Google at 9%, Microsoft 18% and AWS 33%,&#8221; Dinsdale said.<\/p>\n<p>He did point out that the company&#8217;s SaaS business is much stronger. &#8220;Broadening the scope a little to other cloud services, Oracle\u2019s SaaS growth is running roughly in line with overall market SaaS market growth so market share is steady. Oracle\u2019s share of the total enterprise SaaS market is running at around 6%, though if you drill down to the ERP segment it is obviously doing much better than that,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Canalys, another firm that follows the cloud infrastructure market says their numbers tell a similar story for Oracle. While it&#8217;s doing well in Saas with 7.8% market share, it&#8217;s struggling in IaaS\/PaaS.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;For IaaS\/PaaS, Oracle Cloud is at 1.9% for Q2 2020 and that isn\u2019t moving much. The top three providers are AWS, Azure and Google Cloud, who have 30.8%, 20.2% and 6.2% respectively,&#8221; Blake Murray from Canalys told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth keeping in mind that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/11\/19\/google-buys-bebop-and-names-diane-greene-to-lead-enterprise-cloud-effort\/\">Google hired Diane Greene five years ago<\/a> with the hope of accelerating its cloud infrastructure business. Former Oracle exec <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/11\/16\/former-oracle-exec-thomas-kurian-to-replace-diane-greene-as-head-of-google-cloud\/\">Thomas Kurian replaced her<\/a> two years ago and the company&#8217;s market share still hasn&#8217;t reached double digits in spite of a period of big overall market growth, showing how much of a challenge it is to move the needle in a significant way.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"pHwQ9DHXZP\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/12\/google-and-ibm-still-trying-desperately-to-move-cloud-market-share-needle\/\">Google and IBM still trying desperately to move cloud market-share needle<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Google and IBM still trying desperately to move cloud market-share needle&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/12\/google-and-ibm-still-trying-desperately-to-move-cloud-market-share-needle\/embed\/#?secret=pHwQ9DHXZP\" data-secret=\"pHwQ9DHXZP\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Another big company,<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/10\/29\/assessing-ibms-34-billion-red-hat-acquisition\/\"> IBM bought Red Hat<\/a> two years ago for $34 billion with an eye toward improving its cloud business, and while Red Hat has continued to do well, it does not seem to have much impact on the company&#8217;s overall cloud infrastructure market share, which has been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/14\/alibaba-cloud-revenue-reaches-1-5b-for-the-quarter-on-62-growth-rate\/\">superseded by Alibaba<\/a> in fourth place, according to Synergy&#8217;s numbers.

As we get closer to the US election in November we expect this trend to increase as it did this time 4 years ago.<\/p>\n<p>Considering the low quality of the mods being uploaded, the polarising views they express and the fact that a small but vocal contingent of our users are seemingly not intelligent or grown up enough to be able to debate the issues without resorting to name calling and baseless accusations without proof (indicative of the wider issues plaguing our world at this time) we&#8217;ve decided to wipe our hands clean of this mess and invoke an outright ban on mods relating to sociopolitical issues in the United States. We have neither the time, the care or the wish to moderate such things. This ban will apply to all mods uploaded from the 28th of September onwards. We will review this restriction sometime after the next President of the United States has been inaugurated.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>No doubt all over the web there are situations of this sort as ordinarily politically-neutral spaces are infected by toxic discourse. Unlike Facebook and YouTube, however, smaller sites and communities don&#8217;t have thousands of paid moderators or sophisticated machine learning tools to nip the problems in the bud.<\/p>\n<p>As such a total ban doesn&#8217;t seem so much an overreaction as the only reasonable reaction. As the election approaches (and likely well beyond that) it&#8217;s probable that many small communities will have to draw a line in the sand or risk serious incidents such as doxing, threats, and the unwelcome attentions of angry internet mobs.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>NexusMods, a large platform and gathering place for modding PC games, has banned all content relating to the U.S. elections following a flood of troll content, saying &#8220;we&#8217;ve decided to wipe our hands clean of this mess.&#8221; Not exactly headline news, no, but a reminder that the toxic behavior frequently seen (and blamed) on social [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":12084691,"featured_media":2052063,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","carmot_uuid":"6ef36282-c87d-3a9a-ae62-ec1e1e751d29"},"categories":[1256],"tags":[],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/united-states-flag-glitch6.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/2GfUTLa","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"featured":false,"subtitle":"","seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","premiumContent":false,"premiumCutoffPercent":1,"tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[12084691],"hideFeaturedImage":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2055309"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2055309"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2055309\/revisions"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/12084691"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2055309&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/12084691"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2052063"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2055309"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2055309"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2055309"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2055309"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2055309"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2055309"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2055309"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":12084691,"name":"Devin Coldewey","url":"https:\/\/coldewey.cc","description":"","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/devin-coldewey\/","slug":"devin-coldewey","avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/69fae9a8a3933fa91e81c086b8eee14a?s=24&d=identicon&r=g","48":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/69fae9a8a3933fa91e81c086b8eee14a?s=48&d=identicon&r=g","96":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/69fae9a8a3933fa91e81c086b8eee14a?s=96&d=identicon&r=g"},"links":{"homepage":"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/tcdevin","twitter":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/techcrunch","linkedin":"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/techcrunch","crunchbase":"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/devin-coldewey"},"position":"Writer & Photographer","cbDescription":"<p>Devin Coldewey is a Seattle-based writer and photographer.

(they&#8217;re basically the same thing). Disappointingly, 43 of the states&#8217; applications &#8220;had some level of digital inaccessibility.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This could be a variety of things, but take for example an application that&#8217;s a PDF. In order to be accessible the document should be real text that can be read by a screen reader app, and the user should be able to fill in the fields necessary without printing it and grabbing a pen.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Making a single form readable and writable can probably be done in an hour or two, which is why Deque did so and offered the updated forms to each state. Georgia, Rhode Island, Ohio, Montana, Missouri, Maryland, and Kentucky all quickly accepted the offered help. Michigan and Massachusetts have accessible online processes as alternatives to the PDFs, and several states don&#8217;t require applications.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"6MLeUqLprg\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/23\/anything-less-than-nationwide-vote-by-mail-is-electoral-sabotage\/\">Anything less than nationwide vote by mail is electoral sabotage<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Anything less than nationwide vote by mail is electoral sabotage&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/23\/anything-less-than-nationwide-vote-by-mail-is-electoral-sabotage\/embed\/#?secret=6MLeUqLprg\" data-secret=\"6MLeUqLprg\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The remainder have some sort of issue.

Click-through rates, and ultimately view counts, can be greatly influenced by how eye-catching a video title and thumbnail are to a searcher,<\/p>\n<p>In recent years, Google has applied AI to automate video thumbnail extraction, attempting to help users find thumbnails from their videos that are more likely to attract attention and click-throughs.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, with only three provided options to choose from, it\u2019s unlikely the thumbnails Google currently recommends are the best thumbnails for any given video.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s where AI comes in.<\/p>\n<p>With some simple code, it\u2019s possible to run the \u201cintrinsic popularity score\u201d (as derived by a model similar to the one discussed in this article) against <em>all<\/em> of the individual frames of a video, providing a much wider range of options.<\/p>\n<p>The code to do this is <a href=\"https:\/\/colab.research.google.com\/drive\/12wosCbc4xfrJtbwsLsNXjwIrTeaM3oci#scrollTo=FwR2M8fH64GS\">available here<\/a>. This script downloads a YouTube video, splits it into frames as .jpg images, and runs the model on each image, providing a predicted popularity score for each frame image.<br \/>\n<strong>Caveat:<\/strong> It is important to remember that this model was trained and tested on Instagram images. Given the similarity in behavior for clicking on an Instagram photo or a YouTube thumbnail, we feel it\u2019s likely (though never tested) that if a thumbnail is predicted to do well as an Instagram photo, it will similarly do well as a YouTube video thumbnail.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s look at an example of how this works.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/9md3fIfMWiQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;start=563&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2055229\" style=\"width: 553px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2055229\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2055229 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/timelapsehousebuiltby.png?w=543\" alt=\"thumbnail from youtube video with housebuilding couple\" width=\"543\" height=\"485\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/timelapsehousebuiltby.png 543w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/timelapsehousebuiltby.png?resize=150,134 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/timelapsehousebuiltby.png?resize=300,268 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/timelapsehousebuiltby.png?resize=50,45 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 543px) 100vw, 543px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2055229\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Current thumbnail. <strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">YouTube <\/a><span class=\"screen-reader-text\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">(opens in a new window)<\/a><\/span><\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We had the intrinsic popularity model look at three frames per second of this 23-minute video.

target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"facebook\">Facebook <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> today says <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2020\/10\/taking-legal-action-against-data-scraping\/\">it has filed a lawsuit<\/a> in the U.S. against two companies that had engaged in an international &#8220;data scraping&#8221; operation. The operation extended across Facebook properties, including both Facebook and Instagram, as well as other large websites and services, including Twitter, Amazon, LinkedIn and YouTube. The companies, who gathered the data of Facebook users for &#8220;marketing intelligence&#8221; purposes, did so in violation of Facebook&#8217;s Terms of Service, says Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>The businesses named in the lawsuits are Israeli-based BrandTotal Ltd. and Unimania Inc., a business incorporated in Delaware.<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brandtotal.com\/\">BrandTotal&#8217;s<\/a> website, its company offers a real-time competitive intelligence platform that&#8217;s designed to give media, insights and analytics teams visibility into their competition&#8217;s social media strategy and paid campaigns. These insights would allow its customers to analyze and shift their budget allocation to target new opportunities, monitor trends and threats from emerging brands, optimize their ads and messaging, and more.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Meanwhile, Unimania operated apps claimed to offer users the ability to access social networks in different ways. For example, Unimania offered apps that let you view Facebook via a mobile-web interface or alongside other social networks like Twitter. Another app let you view Instagram Stories anonymously, it claimed.<\/p>\n<p>However, Facebook&#8217;s lawsuit is largely focused on two browser extensions offered by the companies: Unimania&#8217;s<a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/ads-feed\/deciloopcooglpjhomblbbjeeenohbpg?hl=en\">\u00a0&#8220;Ads Feed<\/a>&#8221; and BrandTotal&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/upvoice\/bmngkajcejghcgafbobemkpjboikmgfi?hl=en\">UpVoice<\/a>.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The former allowed users to save the ads they saw on Facebook for later reference. But as the extension&#8217;s page discloses, doing so would opt users into a panel that informed the advertising decisions of Unimania&#8217;s corporate customers. UpVote, on the other hand, rewarded users with gift cards for using top social networking and shopping sites and sharing their opinions about the online campaigns run by big brands.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook says these extensions operated in violation of its protections against scraping and its terms of service. When users installed the extensions and visited Facebook websites, the extensions installed automated programs to scrape their name, user ID, gender, date of birth, relationship status, location information, and other information related to their accounts. The data was then sent to a server shared by BrandTotal and Unimania.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; display: block;\"><a style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" title=\"View Facebook lawsuit vs BrandTotal Ltd. and Unimania Inc. on Scribd\" href=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/document\/478333898\/Facebook-lawsuit-vs-BrandTotal-Ltd-and-Unimania-Inc#from_embed\">Facebook lawsuit vs BrandTotal Ltd. and Unimania Inc.<\/a> by <a style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" title=\"View TechCrunch's profile on Scribd\" href=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/publisher\/17551504\/TechCrunch#from_embed\">TechCrunch<\/a> on Scribd<\/p>\n<p><iframe id=\"doc_36050\" class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" title=\"Facebook lawsuit vs BrandTotal Ltd. and Unimania Inc.\" src=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/embeds\/478333898\/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;access_key=key-WF2ETdCfBtOhKRJqsiDN\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" data-auto-height=\"false\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.75\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Data scrapers exist in part to collect as much information as they can through any means possible using automated tools, like bots and scripts. Cambridge Analytica infamously <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/22\/facebook-staff-raised-concerns-about-cambridge-analytica-in-september-2015-per-court-filing\/\">scraped millions of Facebook profiles<\/a> in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election in order to target undecided voters. Other data scraping operations use bots to monitor concert or event ticket prices in order to undercut competitors. Scraped data can also be used for marketing and advertising, or simply sold on to others.<\/p>\n<p>In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook has begun to pursue legal action against various developers that break its terms of service.<\/p>\n<p>Most cases involving data scraping are litigated under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, written in the 1980s to prosecute computer hacking cases. Anyone who <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eff.org\/deeplinks\/2019\/09\/victory-ruling-hiq-v-linkedin-protects-scraping-public-data\">accesses a computer &#8220;without authorization&#8221;<\/a> can face hefty fines or even prison time.<\/p>\n<p>But because the law doesn&#8217;t specifically define what &#8220;authorized&#8221; access is and what isn&#8217;t, tech giants have seen mixed results in their efforts to shut down data scrapers.<\/p>\n<p>LinkedIn <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en\/article\/9kek83\/linkedin-data-scraping-lawsuit-shot-down\">lost<\/a> its high-profile case against HiQ Labs in 2019 after an appeals court ruled that the scraper was only collecting data that was publicly available from the internet. Internet rights groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eff.org\/deeplinks\/2019\/09\/victory-ruling-hiq-v-linkedin-protects-scraping-public-data\">lauded the decision<\/a>, arguing that internet users should not face legal threats &#8220;simply for accessing publicly available information in a way that publishers object to.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Facebook&#8217;s latest legal case is slightly different because the company is accusing BrandTotal of scraping Facebook profile data that wasn&#8217;t inherently public. Facebook says the accused data scraper used a browser extension installed on users&#8217; computers to gain access to their Facebook profile data.<\/p>\n<p>In March 2019, it took action against two Ukrainian developers who were harvesting data using quiz apps and browser extensions to scrape profile information and people\u2019s friends lists, Facebook says. A court in California recently <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Browser-Extension-Case.pdf\">recommended<\/a> a judgement in Facebook&#8217;s favor in the case. A separate <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/STACKLA.pdf\">case<\/a> around scraping filed last year against a marketing partner Stackla\u00a0 also came back in Facebook&#8217;s favor.<\/p>\n<p>This year, Facebook <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2020\/08\/taking-legal-action-against-those-who-abuse-our-platform\/\">filed lawsuits<\/a> against <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/27\/facebook-sues-developers-who-violated-terms-to-collect-user-data-sell-fake-likes\/\">companies<\/a> and individuals engaged in both scraping and fake engagement services.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook isn&#8217;t just cracking down on data scraping businesses to protect user privacy, however. It&#8217;s because failing to do so can lead to large fines. Facebook at the beginning of this year was <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/29\/facebook-will-pay-550-million-to-settle-class-action-lawsuit-over-privacy-violations\/\">ordered<\/a> to pay out over half a billion dollars to settle a class action lawsuit that alleged systemic violation of an Illinois privacy law. Last year, it <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/24\/facebook-settles-with-ftc-5-billion-and-new-privacy-guarantees\/\">settled with the FTC over privacy lapses<\/a> and had to pay a $5 billion penalty. As governments work to further regulation online privacy and data violations, fines like this could add up.<\/p>\n<p>The company says legal action isn&#8217;t the only way it&#8217;s working to stop data scraping. It has also invested in technical teams and tools to monitor and detect suspicious activity and the use of of unauthorized automation for scraping, it says.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Facebook today says it has filed a lawsuit in the U.S. against two companies that had engaged in an international &#8220;data scraping&#8221; operation.

I&#8217;ll be out next week so don&#8217;t miss me too much, but expect the entire Equity team to be back full-speed in mid-October.

We got into the anti-semitic comments that were spewed on Clubhouse, and what that means for the future of the audio-only platform. As Danny so eloquently put it: if Clubhouse is having moderation problems even with an exclusive invite-only user base, the problem will grow.<\/li>\n<li>We also talked about Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong&#8217;s blog post, which triggered a debate between us on whether tech companies can even choose to not be political. For the record, Black Lives Matter is not a political statement.

In spite of that, Oracle founder and chief technology officer Larry Ellison gushed in<a href=\"https:\/\/www.oracle.com\/news\/announcement\/oracle-chosen-as-tiktok-secure-cloud-provider-091920.html\"> a September 19 press release<\/a> about how TikTok had &#8220;chosen&#8221; his company&#8217;s cloud infrastructure service. The statement also indicated that this &#8220;choice&#8221; was influenced by Zoom&#8217;s decision to move <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/28\/in-surprise-choice-zoom-hitches-wagon-to-oracle-for-growing-infrastructure-needs\/\">some percentage of its workloads<\/a> to Oracle&#8217;s infrastructure cloud earlier this year.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"qc4TYorQD1\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/28\/in-surprise-choice-zoom-hitches-wagon-to-oracle-for-growing-infrastructure-needs\/\">In surprise choice, Zoom partners with Oracle for growing infrastructure needs<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;In surprise choice, Zoom partners with Oracle for growing infrastructure needs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/28\/in-surprise-choice-zoom-hitches-wagon-to-oracle-for-growing-infrastructure-needs\/embed\/#?secret=qc4TYorQD1\" data-secret=\"qc4TYorQD1\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The mechanics of the TikTok deal aside, the question is how big an effect will these two customers have on the company&#8217;s overall cloud infrastructure market share. We asked a couple of firms who closely watch all things cloud.<\/p>\n<p>John Dinsdale, chief analyst at Synergy Research Group, wasn&#8217;t terribly optimistic that they would have much material impact on moving the market share needle for the database giant. &#8220;<a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/oracle\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"oracle\">Oracle\u2019s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> cloud infrastructure services growth has been consistently below overall IaaS and PaaS market growth rates so its market share has [actually] been nudging downward. Zoom may be a good win but it is unlikely to move the needle too much &#8212; and remember <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/zoom-video-communications\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"zoom-video-communications\">Zoom <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> also buys cloud services from AWS,&#8221; Dinsdale told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>As for TikTok, Dinsdale, like the rest of us, wasn&#8217;t clear how that deal would ultimately play out, but he says even with both companies in the fold, it wasn&#8217;t going to shift market share as much as Oracle might hope. &#8220;Hypothetically, even if Zoom\/TikTok helped Oracle increase its cloud infrastructure service revenues 50% over 12 months, which would be a real stretch, its market share would still be nearer to 2% than 3%. This compares with Google at 9%, Microsoft 18% and AWS 33%,&#8221; Dinsdale said.<\/p>\n<p>He did point out that the company&#8217;s SaaS business is much stronger. &#8220;Broadening the scope a little to other cloud services, Oracle\u2019s SaaS growth is running roughly in line with overall market SaaS market growth so market share is steady. Oracle\u2019s share of the total enterprise SaaS market is running at around 6%, though if you drill down to the ERP segment it is obviously doing much better than that,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Canalys, another firm that follows the cloud infrastructure market says their numbers tell a similar story for Oracle. While it&#8217;s doing well in Saas with 7.8% market share, it&#8217;s struggling in IaaS\/PaaS.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;For IaaS\/PaaS, Oracle Cloud is at 1.9% for Q2 2020 and that isn\u2019t moving much. The top three providers are AWS, Azure and Google Cloud, who have 30.8%, 20.2% and 6.2% respectively,&#8221; Blake Murray from Canalys told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth keeping in mind that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/11\/19\/google-buys-bebop-and-names-diane-greene-to-lead-enterprise-cloud-effort\/\">Google hired Diane Greene five years ago<\/a> with the hope of accelerating its cloud infrastructure business.

He was previously the founder of Canary, Peixe Urbano and was Facebook\u2019s first employee in Brazil.\r\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">\u201cGradually, then suddenly.\u201d<\/span> Hemingway\u2019s words succinctly capture the recent history of tech in Latin America. After more than a decade of gradual progress made through fits and starts, tech in Latin America finally hit its stride and has been growing at an accelerating pace in recent years.<\/p>\n<p>The region now boasts 17 unicorns up from zero just three years ago. For the first time, the most valuable company in the region isn&#8217;t a state-controlled oil or mining behemoth, but rather e-commerce platform MercadoLibre.<\/p>\n<p>We are only in the first chapter of this long story, however. When we compare the penetration of tech companies in Latin America to both developed and developing markets, we estimate that the market could grow nearly tenfold over the next decade. The value to be unlocked will be measured in trillions of dollars and the lives improved in the hundreds of millions.<\/p>\n<p>Our venture capital fund, Atlantico, conducts a thorough annual analysis of market data from Latin America in what we call the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.atlantico.vc\/latin-america-digital-transformation-report\">Latin America Digital Transformation Report<\/a>. The report consists of hundreds of data-rich slides based off of original studies, surveys and models constructed from a combination of public and proprietary data shared by many of the region\u2019s leading tech companies. This year, for the first time, we have decided to make the report public and here we highlight some of the findings from this year.<\/p>\n<p>Global venture capitalists, the likes of Sequoia, Benchmark and a16z have planted their flags through key investments in companies like <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/nubank\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"nubank\">Nubank, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Wildlife and Loft. Those are not isolated incidents \u2013 venture capital investments in the region have nearly doubled annually for the last three years according to the Latin American Venture Capital Association (LAVCA). In order to understand what investors are seeing in the region, we analyzed the market through a simple framework we apply throughout our report.<\/p>\n<p>The starting point for this framework is the socioeconomic foundation in place. The context in which transformation occurs is important in shaping its possible outcome. The same ingredients applied in different contexts and time periods will produce very different results. Thus, we believe that Latin America is unique globally, and the types of companies that will flourish (and to what extent) will be different than in other parts of the world. Trying to shoehorn foreign business models and products is unlikely to yield good results.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of Latin America, it&#8217;s key to remember the region boasts a population twice that of the United States and a GDP half that of China\u2019s (but similar on a per capita basis). In short: Latin America is big, a central factor that has the power to attract capital and talent. However, also critical to note is that economic inequality is severe. While a quarter of the region\u2019s population lives in poverty, the wealthy in Mexico City and S\u00e3o Paulo enjoy living standards in line with their peers in New York and London.<\/p>\n<p>This unique mix of large opportunity and critical problems waiting to be solved has provided fertile ground for the gig economy to flourish. Case-in-point: Brazil is <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/uber\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"uber\">Uber\u2019s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> largest market globally in volume of rides, with S\u00e3o Paulo its largest city. Rappi, a major food delivery player in the region, valued at over $3 billion, grew its sales by 113% over the first five months of the pandemic. When taken together, the largest ride-hailing and food-delivery services in Brazil are already the largest private employer in Brazil, a formidable contribution to reducing high unemployment.<\/p>\n<p>When we track technology company value as a percent of the economy (tech company market cap as a % of GDP) we clearly see that Latin America, at 2.2% penetration, has a ways to go. Our estimate is that it is 10 years behind China (at 27% penetration), which itself is five years behind current U.S. levels (39% penetration).<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2055130\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2055130\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2055130\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/B-TechPenetrationGlobal.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"431\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/B-TechPenetrationGlobal.jpg 2836w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/B-TechPenetrationGlobal.jpg?resize=150,95 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/B-TechPenetrationGlobal.jpg?resize=300,190 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/B-TechPenetrationGlobal.jpg?resize=768,487 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/B-TechPenetrationGlobal.jpg?resize=680,431 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/B-TechPenetrationGlobal.jpg?resize=1536,974 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/B-TechPenetrationGlobal.jpg?resize=2048,1298 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/B-TechPenetrationGlobal.jpg?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2055130\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Atlantico<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>However, it is important to note that Latin America is making up for lost time.

On Monday, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong wrote a company blog post titled &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.coinbase.com\/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804\">Coinbase is a mission focused company<\/a>&#8221; which drew both praise and critique that has continued throughout the week. Personally, I wasn\u2019t terribly impressed.<\/p>\n<p>I limited my reaction on Twitter to one retweet, a couple of replies and some likes. But on Tuesday, a journalist asked if I had any comment to contribute to a piece she\u2019s writing on the matter, so I tried to articulate a comment in one or two lines. The next thousand-ish words is what I ended up with.<\/p>\n<p>This is such a sensitive, nuanced and personal topic, and I wouldn\u2019t want to be irresponsible by making a quick off-handed remark or not taking enough into consideration.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>However, I think it\u2019s so important, it\u2019d be irresponsible <strong>not <\/strong>to say something when asked.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d like to think I understood the intent \u2014 that Brian wants to ensure that <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/coinbase\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"coinbase\">Coinbase <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> is inclusive of people who hold different views than what\u2019s assumed to be progressive in the tech sector (or elsewhere) and avoid creating a workplace that is divided and too &#8220;distracted&#8221; (his word) by political causes or social activism.<\/p>\n<p>However, what he\u2019s really only done is highlight his tremendous position of privilege. Privilege doesn\u2019t mean that he hasn\u2019t struggled or hasn\u2019t worked hard at being CEO of his company or in life. It simply means he thinks social activism can be a \u201cdistraction.&#8221; It means he thinks it\u2019s a distraction to think about human rights and whether what\u2019s happening around us is just or not.<\/p>\n<p>It means he doesn&#8217;t wake up worrying about how institutional racism or systemic oppression might affect him. It means he doesn\u2019t relate to the feeling that he could be the next driver to be unjustifiably stopped and searched, asked to get out of his car (or worse) for a broken taillight or verbally ridiculed or assaulted for someone else\u2019s assumptions about his sexual orientation. It means he doesn\u2019t think the rise of white supremacy in America is going to affect or diminish his ability to \u201cstay focused\u201d on his company\u2019s mission. It means he doesn\u2019t have to go to work wondering if he\u2019ll be pushed aside, undermined or spoken over by a male colleague.<\/p>\n<p>Brian\u2019s statement made me think back to conversations I had with some friends over the summer who said they weren\u2019t going to watch \u201cevery single video\u201d of police brutality in the U.S. relating to the Black Lives Matter protests. It\u2019s possible that I was watching too much because it was only increasing my frustration and feelings of powerlessness to help or change things, but I also realized that my friends admitting that they\u2019d stopped watching each new video was a luxury and a privilege for them.<\/p>\n<p>They didn\u2019t have to watch them \u2014 no one is required to \u2014 but they were able to switch off because the injustice and inequity of it all doesn\u2019t burn in their minds. It doesn\u2019t affect them personally. It doesn\u2019t impact how they walk down the street or conduct themselves around law enforcement. They have the privilege of not ever imagining or worrying if the victims of police brutality happened to be their family or close friends or even people they might know.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/brian-armstrong\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"brian-armstrong\">Brian Armstrong\u2019s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> call to not engage in political discourse via his platform and his position as a leader is a privilege whilst others are compelled out of concern and fear to speak up for themselves, others, and those who have softer or even no voices.<\/p>\n<p>In the memo, he takes time to reiterate the fact that the company will \u201cfocus on the things that help us achieve our mission,\u201d including sourcing job candidates from underrepresented backgrounds, reducing unconscious bias and fostering an environment where everyone is welcome regardless of background, sexual orientation, race, gender, age, etc. While I\u2018m glad to see him recognize these areas of focus, immediately after that section he goes on to say that <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/coinbase\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"coinbase\">Coinbase <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> won\u2019t engage on \u201cbroader societal issues\u201d or advocacy for political causes. From where does he think the first set of principles emerged?!?<\/p>\n<p>It seems outlandish to have to establish this, but it wasn\u2019t always the case that sexual orientation, race, gender or age were awarded equal treatment in employment law. It was in my lifetime that women could be fired from work for being pregnant. It is precisely engaging in \u201cbroader societal issues\u201d that brought about those points of legal fairness and equality \u2014 and those are incredibly vulnerable right now. How dare he say he\u2019s willing to embrace and stand for what\u2019s been established so far, but that there\u2019s no reason to engage any further? What that tells me is that as far as he\u2019s concerned, the debates and activism to date have achieved enough and the rest, now, is distraction.<\/p>\n<p>That. Is. Privilege.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously, I know Coinbase is Brian\u2019s company, and therefore it\u2019s fully his prerogative to lay out the \u201cmission\u201d and rules as he sees fit. But what bothers me is that he and others who are feeling emboldened to say they agree or even commend him for \u201cbeing brave\u201d enough for saying so won\u2019t realize the extent of their privilege and may inadvertently walk back so much recent progress and positive dialogue in the tech sector and business more broadly. We\u2019ve seen so much evidence in recent years that consumers and purchasing power gravitate toward brands and companies that articulate what they stand for.<\/p>\n<p>No longer is it enough for brands to be likable or just upbeat. Their silence on social injustices is deafening. Their association with individuals who either contribute to or enable racism or oppression of people and groups is enough for customers to think twice about using them. Their public support of activism and human rights either in merchandise or TV advertisements drives up their stock price. As more and more products and services are increasingly commoditized, consumers have sought to align themselves with brands and products that reflect their ethos.<\/p>\n<p>It was a free pass for too long for businesses and their leaders to say that they didn\u2019t wade into politics. In recent years, for example, because of the U.K.-EU Brexit referendum, the 2016 U.S. presidential election, or other occasions, companies and brand values have been drawn out and exposed for good or bad. It would be a shame for consumers and all stakeholders to lose that trend.<\/p>\n<p>I hope that investor shareholders and employees of companies where leaders might be asserting similar views of not wanting to get \u201cdistracted\u201d by social action will help to demonstrate just how much impact can be achieved by dialogue and action.<\/p>\n<p>People do their best work and form championship

And I admit that I often forget Live View exists. Adding it to multimodel directions may just get me to try it out more often since it is now more clearly highlighted in the app.<\/p>\n<p>Google Maps can now also identify landmarks around you to give you better guidance and a clearer idea of where you are in a city. Think the Empire State Building in New York, for example.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2055083\" style=\"width: 710px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Landmarks_Live_View.gif\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2055083\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2055083\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Landmarks_Live_View.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"700\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2055083\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Google<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>These new landmarks will be coming to Amsterdam, Bangkok, Barcelona, Berlin, Budapest, Dubai, Florence, Istanbul, Kuala Lumpur, Kyoto, London, Los Angeles, Madrid, Milan, Munich, New York, Osaka, Paris, Prague, Rome, San Francisco, Sydney, Tokyo and Vienna, with more to follow.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a regular Live View user, you&#8217;ll know that the actual pin locations in this mode can sometimes be off. In hilly areas, the pin can often be hovering high above your destination, for example. Now, Google promises to fix this by using a combination of machine learning and better topographical maps to place the pin exactly where it&#8217;s supposed to be.<\/p>\n<p>Also new is the ability to use Live View in combination with Google Maps&#8217; location sharing feature.

soon after Lai brought the deal to Bullpen roughly a year ago, it knew it had found its newest GP.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Hemster was founded by a solo founder, who happens to be a woman (Allison Lee), who happens to be a first-time entrepreneur. In the traditional world of venture capital, that&#8217;s three knocks against the company.<\/p>\n<p>What the company does &#8212; on-demand tailoring &#8212; doesn&#8217;t necessarily sound on its face like a venture-like bet, either. Martino admitted that his first reaction to Lai&#8217;s pitch was: Why would we fund this?<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ShFU9N9fVs\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/23\/primetime-vc-venture-capitalists-are-going-on-a-gameshow-of-accredited-banter\/\">Venture capitalists have found a new home to brag and debate: PrimeTime VC<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Venture capitalists have found a new home to brag and debate: PrimeTime VC&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/23\/primetime-vc-venture-capitalists-are-going-on-a-gameshow-of-accredited-banter\/embed\/#?secret=ShFU9N9fVs\" data-secret=\"ShFU9N9fVs\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Yet what Lai saw, and Bullpen eventually did, too, is a company positioned well to seize on the continuing shift from offline to online shopping, where all manner of technologies have tried to map body types in order to guarantee a better fit for customers. But Hemster, by constructing data about customers and their preferred fit, could potentially develop a portable identify for individuals in the world of digital retail.<\/p>\n<p>The company has already worked with Alo Yoga and Farfetch to test out its technology; if all goes well, it will eventually partner with many other major retailers, and &#8220;if you like how something fits based on one alteration, you&#8217;re able to find that same fit irregardless of retailer,&#8221; said Lai.<\/p>\n<p>Bullpen &#8212; which is also run by GPs Eric Wiesen and Duncan Davidson &#8212; thinks it has an ear for startups whose proposition is likely to be overlooked by other investors, and it&#8217;s pushing that narrative aggressively.<\/p>\n<p>During our chat earlier this week, Martino pointed separately to FanDuel, the gaming company that sprang from Edinburgh, Scotland, co-founded by husband and wife Nigel and Lesley Eccles. &#8220;Everyone overlooked it,&#8221; said Martino. &#8220;It was the wrong location and the wrong team. I can&#8217;t tell you how many firms [we approached as potential coinvestors who] said, &#8216;Categorically, 100% percent, no husband-and-wife teams.&#8217; &#8221;<\/p>\n<p>FanDuel eventually reached a valuation of $1 billion before selling for half that amount to the Dublin, Ireland-based bookmaker Paddy Power Betfair, since renamed Flutter Entertainment. While the exit reinforces Martino&#8217;s point, it should be noted that the story doesn&#8217;t have the happiest ending. Earlier this year, FanDuel&#8217;s founders <a href=\"https:\/\/www.legalsportsreport.com\/38437\/fanduel-founders-sue-in-ny-court\/\">filed a lawsuit<\/a> against private equity investors KKR and Shamrock Capital of squeezing FanDuel\u2019s founders, early employees and its early funders out of any interest in the sports gaming site following that sale.<\/p>\n<p>A far newer investment that also hints at Bullpen&#8217;s appetite for the unconventional is Sisu Cosmetics, a nearly two-year-old, Ireland-based chain of cosmetic clinics that&#8217;s expanding into the U.S., and earlier this week announced <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/29\/with-a-warby-parker-playbook-sisu-raises-funding-from-greycroft-to-face-off-against-cosmetic-clinics\/\">$5.5 million<\/a> in Series A funding led by Greycroft and Bullpen.<\/p>\n<p>Bullpen&#8217;s funds have all been similar in size, backing roughly 25 startups each; Martino said to expect the same of the firm&#8217;s new fund, which will generally invest $2 million to $4 million into rounds that are $4 million to $6 million in size.<\/p>\n<p>Lai &#8212; who settled a lawsuit against Binary&#8217;s co-founders earlier this year after alleging a culture of harassment at the firm, including a requirement that female job applicants submit headshots &#8212; will now be writing a quarter of those checks.<\/p>\n<p>Asked if she wanted to comment about the somewhat <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-06-10\/binary-capital-settles-harassment-suit-that-roiled-silicon-valley\">famous case<\/a>, she said she has long moved on from it.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"gkzNPQp7RO\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/29\/with-a-warby-parker-playbook-sisu-raises-funding-from-greycroft-to-face-off-against-cosmetic-clinics\/\">With a Warby Parker playbook, SISU raises funding from Greycroft to face off against cosmetic clinics<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute;

For example, someone could identify themselves as a mother who likes painting, has a dog and works as a baker.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"pl5yxoNfjE\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/29\/greylock-is-trying-to-diversify-techs-wealth-cycle\/\">Greylock and MLT are trying to diversify tech&#8217;s wealth cycle<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Greylock and MLT are trying to diversify tech&#8217;s wealth cycle&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/29\/greylock-is-trying-to-diversify-techs-wealth-cycle\/embed\/#?secret=pl5yxoNfjE\" data-secret=\"pl5yxoNfjE\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;We would then spit out communities we think are the best fit for you,&#8221; Austin said.<\/p>\n<p>That will enable Somewhere Good to foster an additional level of connection for users, Austin said. One way of achieving that extra layer will be through a matchmaking tool.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to give people a more tangible reason for connection,&#8221; Austin said. &#8220;Other than you&#8217;re both Black.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Ethel&#8217;s Club, the wellness platform for people of color that currently lives on Mighty Networks, will be just one of many communities on Somewhere Good. The plan is to bring on a number of other communities to the platform that center Black people and people of color. From there, Austin envisions users of those communities may then create communities of their own on Somewhere Good.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We want to give space to people who are already creating community, allow people who want community to build it and then for the audience, once they&#8217;re feeling empowered, to be able to build community,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>When you go to Somewhere Good right now, you&#8217;ll engage in a Stumble Upon-esque experience where you click &#8220;Take me somewhere new&#8221; to see a brand geared toward Black people or people of color. There are a little over 100 brands currently featured on the site, including Black hair brand <a href=\"https:\/\/nappyheadclub.com\/\">Nappy Head Club,<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.slugglobal.com\/\">\u00a0<\/a>Black designer directory <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blackfashionfair.org\/designers\">Black Fashion Fair<\/a> and cereal and culture brand <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eatofflimits.com\/\">OffLimits<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2053982\" style=\"width: 1090px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2053982\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2053982 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/offlimits.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1080\" height=\"686\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/offlimits.png 1080w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/offlimits.png?resize=150,95 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/offlimits.png?resize=300,191 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/offlimits.png?resize=768,488 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/offlimits.png?resize=680,432 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/offlimits.png?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2053982\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> OffLimits<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>While OffLimits, for example, doesn&#8217;t currently have a community, the brand centers around thinking about food differently, Austin said. But OffLimits, which tells its story through &#8220;emotionally unstable, counterculture cartoon characters,&#8221; could run a community on Somewhere Good centered around product design or food. She also envisions makeup brand Fenty running a community centered around skin care.<\/p>\n<p>Each community on Somewhere Good will have a moderator and all members will need to follow Somewhere Good&#8217;s code of conduct. The platform will not allow any hate speech, abusive behavior, bullying or other types of violence.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Any users acting against our code of conduct will be immediately removed from the Somewhere Good platform,&#8221; the platform&#8217;s mission statement says.<\/p>\n<p>Somewhere Good will be a 100% ad-free environment and says it will never sell data. Its business model relies on users paying to join communities and then taking a percentage of that transaction.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;That means we have to create a compelling opportunity for people to create communities,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>Down the road, Somewhere Good plans to enable communities to charge for live-streamed events, sell products and enable other types of peer-to-peer transactions. The company would then take a percentage from those transactions, as well.<\/p>\n<p>Somewhere Good soft-launched with a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/najjmahal\/status\/1309535100670013441?s=20\">tweet<\/a> last week and began taking signups. Already, there are more than 2,500 people on the wait list.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a similar strategy Austin said she had with Ethel&#8217;s Club. With Ethel&#8217;s Club, she didn&#8217;t quite know the functionality of the product before launching but went ahead and started talking about it to see if there was interest. Once Austin saw there was interest, Ethel&#8217;s Club embraced the community to help the company build products they wanted. That&#8217;s the same framework she&#8217;s now using for Somewhere Good, she said.<\/p>\n<p>Ethel&#8217;s Club, which got its start as a physical community space in Brooklyn before expanding into the digital realm as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, has currently raised a little over $1 million from Dream Machine, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/shrug-capital\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"shrug-capital\">Shrug Capital, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/canvas-venture-fund\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"canvas-venture-fund\">Canvas Ventures, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Color, Debut Capital and angel investors like Katie Stanton, Roxane Gay and Hannibal Buress.<\/p>\n<p>Since transitioning into digital, Ethel&#8217;s Club has grown to more than 1,500 members. But the biggest issue is that people just want more, Austin said. And Somewhere Good aims to be just that, she said. It aims to be the one platform where people of color can go to for everything.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"xnwvBDoAHI\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/19\/human-capital-the-black-founders-burden\/\">Human Capital: The Black founder&#8217;s burden<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Human Capital: The Black founder&#8217;s burden&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/19\/human-capital-the-black-founders-burden\/embed\/#?secret=xnwvBDoAHI\" data-secret=\"xnwvBDoAHI\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"xzYMsk42rh\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/25\/black-founders-face-a-unique-set-of-challenges\/\">Black founders face a unique set of challenges<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Black founders face a unique set of challenges&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/25\/black-founders-face-a-unique-set-of-challenges\/embed\/#?secret=xzYMsk42rh\" data-secret=\"xzYMsk42rh\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Naj Austin, founder and CEO of subscription-based physical and digital community Ethel&#8217;s Club, is building Somewhere Good to be a one-stop shop for people of color.

Through a spokesperson, IonQ also noted that it doesn\u2019t necessarily think quantum volume is the best metric, but since the rest of the industry is using it, it decided to release this number. The company argues that its ability to achieve 99.9% fidelity between qubits has allowed it to achieve this breakthrough.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\u201cIn a single generation of hardware, we went from 11 to 32 qubits, and more importantly, improved the fidelity required to use all 32 qubits,\u201d said IonQ CEO and president <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/peter-chapman-2\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"peter-chapman-2\">Peter Chapman <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>. \u201cDepending on the application, customers will need somewhere between 80 and 150 very high-fidelity qubits and logic gates to see quantum advantage.

acquired, I would probably never use. It&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/teenage.engineering\/products\/ob-4\">this OB-4 &#8220;magic radio&#8221; from Teenage Engineering<\/a>, a design group that creates tech with a playful but premium approach. This wireless speaker not only looks lovely but has a handful of really interesting features, the most interesting of which has to be letting you, at any time, rewind up to two hours with the spin of a dial.<\/p>\n<p>The truth is I rarely would require the rewinding feature, which seems mainly useful for catching a bit of a podcast you missed or, for those of us who still listen to FM radio now and then, going back to hear the DJ say the name of an artist or piece. You can also slow it down and presumably scratch a bit by spinning the little circle, though again it&#8217;s probably more fun in theory than in practice.<\/p>\n<p>But when the thing looks this good, who cares? The design reminds me strongly of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2011\/04\/11\/review-tdk-3-speaker-boombox\/\">TDK&#8217;s 3-speaker boombox<\/a>, which I reviewed way back in 2011, but evolved. The mechanical knobs and buttons look fabulous and I have no doubt turn with a wonderful tactility. I love a good volume knob and this one looks like a winner.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ob-4-top.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2055051\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ob-4-top.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ob-4-top.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ob-4-top.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ob-4-top.jpg?resize=300,187 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ob-4-top.jpg?resize=768,480 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ob-4-top.jpg?resize=680,425 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ob-4-top.jpg?resize=1536,959 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ob-4-top.jpg?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a>With two larger speakers and two smaller tweeter types, it should be able to create a pretty solid sound. Frequency response goes down to 54 Hz, so you won&#8217;t be getting the deepest bass notes possible, but really with drivers this size they wouldn&#8217;t be able to move enough air for it to matter. More importantly, it&#8217;ll go for 8 hours at max volume or, more likely, 30-50 hours at normal loudness levels.<\/p>\n<p>The built-in little computer and drive have some interesting modes: an adjustable metronome, a 30-channel mantra repeater, and a drone generator that stretches and distorts snippets of radio stations. That last one sounds pretty cool.<\/p>\n<p>The handle has the antenna built into it for FM reception, and folds down to act as a stand if you don&#8217;t mind your music blasting into the ground or table.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ob-4-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2055052\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ob-4-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"772\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ob-4-1.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ob-4-1.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ob-4-1.jpg?resize=300,226 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ob-4-1.jpg?resize=768,579 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ob-4-1.jpg?resize=680,513 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ob-4-1.jpg?resize=1536,1158 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ob-4-1.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a>At $599, it&#8217;s not exactly an impulse buy.

<a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2020\/10\/supporting-online-communities\/\">introducing<\/a> a suite of new features for Facebook Groups, the private social networking product now used by over 1.8 billion people every month. At the company&#8217;s digitally hosted Facebook Communities Summit today, Facebook detailed a set of upcoming tools aimed at those who run Groups, which are designed help them better organize, filter and manage their communities, as well as new features focused on sparking discussions &#8212; like chats, prompts and Q&amp;As. Notably, Facebook also said it would soon launch a test of a new feature that will highlight public group discussions to non-group members, including both on Facebook and off, via web searches.<\/p>\n<p>The announcement comes at a time when Facebook Groups are making headlines for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/facebook-removed-6500-militia-groups-pages-002343444.html\">their growing use<\/a> by those looking to spread harmful content and misinformation. Facebook this week said it removed over 6,500 militia groups and pages just last month alone, for example. Facebook Groups have also become the breeding grounds for a wide range of dangerous content, including health misinformation, anti-science movements, and<a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/nation-now\/2018\/08\/01\/qanon-trump-florida-rally-what-q-signs-mean\/878642002\/\"> baseless conspiracy theories that brainwash users<\/a> into thinking there are secret signals hidden on the internet offering insight into an alternate reality that only they can see.<\/p>\n<p>The new feature set for the Facebook Groups product itself, announced today, aren&#8217;t necessarily focused solving these sorts of issues, however.

the general commercial availability of weight loss product, Plenity<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Developed by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gelesis.com\/\">Gelesis<\/a>, a biotech company that makes treatments for gastro-intestinal disorders, Plenity is a weight loss treatment that uses citric acid and cellulose to create a non-toxic paste that makes people feel more full after they ingest it. Taken before meals, the pill becomes a substance that expands to take up about 25% of the stomach, so people eat less.<\/p>\n<p>The product has been approved by the U.S. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/food-and-drug-administration\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"food-and-drug-administration\">Food and Drug Administration <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and is available for a much broader segment of the population than other weight loss products. While most prescription medicines are intended for people who are obese, the Gelesis product is made for people who are overweight, too.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;That\u2019s adults who have a BMI from 25 up to 40. That\u2019s 150 million Americans,&#8221; <\/span>according to Gelesis chief commercial and operating officer, David Pass.<\/p>\n<p>Plenity <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2019\/04\/29\/health\/obesity-weight-loss-capsule-plenity-gelesis-fda\/index.html\">received FDA approval last April<\/a>, and Gelesis started working with Ro soon after, according to Pass. The idea was to craft a strategy that could get the treatment, which is classified as a medical device and not a drug, in the hands of as many patients as quickly as possible.<\/p>\n<p>For Ro, the agreement with Gelesis is a sign of potential things to come. The company is the exclusive online provider of the Plenity treatment and Ro founder Zachariah Reitano said that there&#8217;s an incredible potential to engage in more of these types of deals.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;W<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">e would love to be able to partner with pharmaceutical companies to decrease the cost of distribution,&#8221; said Reitano. &#8220;We were excited to build an exciting treatment solution for weight management.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our high-level mission is to be the patient\u2019s first call.&#8221; <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the Gelesis partnership Ro can add another highly desirable treatment to its roster of therapies &#8212; and one that can be a contributing factor to increasing the severity of other conditions that the company already provides treatment for, Reitano said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"VIERIH0ZHa\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/20\/hims-hers-launch-spanish-language-telemedicine-services\/\">Hims &#038; Hers launch Spanish language telemedicine services<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Hims &#038; Hers launch Spanish language telemedicine services&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/20\/hims-hers-launch-spanish-language-telemedicine-services\/embed\/#?secret=VIERIH0ZHa\" data-secret=\"VIERIH0ZHa\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">&#8220;There are a few conditions that we currently treat that are exacerbated by a patient being overweight or obese. People who struggle with weight management will also experience ED. Obesity can lead to heart failure, stroke, coronary heart disease, hypertension, depression,&#8221; Reitano said. &#8220;The breadth of the label is interesting. Only FDA approved with a BMI from 25 to 40. FDA approved treatment have been between 30 and 40. [It] makes the treatment more accessible to a wider variety of people.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>As the only online provider of the treatment, Ro has developed an onboarding process to ensure that the Plenity therapy isn&#8217;t abused by people who suffer from eating disorders.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;During our onboarding we not only ask questions to patients about their weight management. There\u2019s a consecutive set of images that need to be uploaded and taken with the provider. That\u2019s something we\u2019ve taken a lot of time and energy to make sure about,&#8221; said Reitano.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Like the other treatments Ro offers, Plenity is a cash-pay prescription, because the weight loss treatments aren&#8217;t typically covered by insurance, he said.<\/p>\n<p>The benefit of working with an online pharmacy like Ro to provide distribution for a new therapy was obvious to both startups.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;We turned this market on its head by putting the consumer at the heart of everything we do,&#8221; said Pass. The treatment costs $98 per month, compared to other therapies or branded medications that could be as much $300 and $350 per month, according to Pass.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>One reason that Gelesis is able to reduce the price of the drug is that it won&#8217;t have to hire a massive sales force to pitch it. The company has Ro for that.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;Normally you have a pharmaceutical company that would have to hire a sales force and go door to door and it increases the cost of a new drug. [Ro] can make a new, innovative treatment, like Plenity, available nationwide,&#8221; Reitano said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"pUziHap7yY\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/27\/digital-elective-care-and-telemedicine-provider-ro-raises-200-million-at-a-reported-1-5-billion-valuation\/\">Digital elective care and telemedicine provider Ro raises $200 million at a reported $1.5 billion valuation<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Digital elective care and telemedicine provider Ro raises $200 million at a reported $1.5 billion valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/27\/digital-elective-care-and-telemedicine-provider-ro-raises-200-million-at-a-reported-1-5-billion-valuation\/embed\/#?secret=pUziHap7yY\" data-secret=\"pUziHap7yY\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In what could be the first step in the development of a significant new line of business for the telemedicine prescription provider Ro, the company is finally announcing the general commercial availability of weight loss product, Plenity.
