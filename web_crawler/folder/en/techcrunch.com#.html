Watch Series 6 review"},"content":{"rendered":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">When it comes<\/span> to smartwatches, it\u2019s Apple against the world. It\u2019s not that there aren\u2019t plenty of other products to choose from \u2014 it\u2019s more that the company has just utterly dominated the space to such a point that any other device is relegated to the realm of \u201c<a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Watch alternatives.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The company has been successful in the space for the usual Apple reasons: premium hardware with deeply integrated software, third-party support, a large cross-device ecosystem play and, of, course, simplicity. Taken as a whole, the Watch just works, right out of the box.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Five years after launch, the line is fairly mature. As such, it\u2019s no surprise, really, that recent updates have largely amounted to refinements. As with most updates, the watch has gotten a processor boost up to the A14 processor, which the company claims is 20% faster than the last version.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>Perhaps the biggest hardware upgrade, however, is the addition of a blood oxygen sensor, an important piece in the company\u2019s quest to offer as complete an image of wearer health as is possible from the wrist.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Dkvjc9vzsO\"><p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/a-closer-look-at-the-new-apple-watches\/\">A closer look at the new Apple Watches<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;A closer look at the new Apple Watches&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/a-closer-look-at-the-new-apple-watches\/embed\/#?secret=Dkvjc9vzsO\" data-secret=\"Dkvjc9vzsO\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">I wrote<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/a-closer-look-at-the-new-apple-watches\/\"> a pretty lengthy piece<\/a> about the watch last week after wearing it for a few days. As I mentioned at the time, it was an odd kind of writeup, somewhere between hands-on and review. A week or so later, however, I\u2019m more comfortable calling this a review \u2014 even if not too many of my initial impressions have changed much in the past several days. After all, a mature product largely means most of the foundations remain unchanged.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Series 6 certainly looks the part. The Watch is tough to distinguish from other recent models \u2014 and for that matter, the new and significantly cheaper SE. The biggest visual change is the addition of new colors. In addition to the standard Gray and Gold, Apple\u2019s added new Blue and (Product)Red cases. The latter seems to be the more ostentatious of the pair. The company sent me a blue model, and honestly, it\u2019s a lot more subtle than I expected. It\u2019s more of a deep blue hue, really, that reads more as black a lot of the time.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s tough to imagine the product undergoing any sort of radical rethink of the device\u2019s design language at this point. We may see slight tweaks, including larger screen area going forward, but on the whole, Apple is very much committed to a form factor that has worked very well for it. I will probably always prefer Samsung\u2019s spinning bezel as a quick way to interface with the operating system, but the crown does the job well and scrolling through menus even feels a bit zippier this time, perhaps owing to that faster silicon.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"LWNvL7GOH3\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/you-can-now-return-apples-solo-loop-for-a-new-size-without-sending-back-the-watch\/\">You can now return Apple\u2019s Solo Loop for a new size, without sending back the Watch<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;You can now return Apple\u2019s Solo Loop for a new size, without sending back the Watch&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/you-can-now-return-apples-solo-loop-for-a-new-size-without-sending-back-the-watch\/embed\/#?secret=LWNvL7GOH3\" data-secret=\"LWNvL7GOH3\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">The new Solo Loop bands hit a bit of a hiccup out of the gate. I\u2019ve <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/you-can-now-return-apples-solo-loop-for-a-new-size-without-sending-back-the-watch\/\">detailed that a bit more here<\/a>, but I suspect that much of the problem came down to the difficulty of selling a specifically sized product during a strange period in history where in-person try-ons aren\u2019t really an option. In other words, just really bad timing on that front.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Personally, I quite like the braided model. I\u2019ve been using it as my day to day band. It\u2019s nice and blends in a lot better than the silicone model (I\u2019ve frankly never been much of a fan of Apple\u2019s silicone bands). But I do need to mention that Apple sent me a couple different sizes, which made it much easier to find the right fit. I recognize that. Especially when the braided Solo Loop costs a fairly exorbitant $99. The silicone version is significantly cheaper at $49, but either way, you\u2019re not getting off cheap there. So you definitely want to make sure you get the right fit.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052164\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052164\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2052164\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg 4000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052164\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This is doubly important given the fact that the Series 6\u2019s biggest new feature \u2014 blood oxygen monitoring \u2014 is highly dependent on you getting a good fit. The sensor utilizes a series of LEDs on the bottom of the watch to shine infrared and red light through the wearer\u2019s skin and into their blood vessels. The color of light that reflects back gives the watch a picture of the oxygen levels in the blood. The whole thing takes about 15 seconds, but only works if your fit is right. Even with the right Solo Loop on, I found myself having to retake it a few times when I first started wearing the watch.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Beyond the on-demand measurements, the watch will also take readings throughout the day and night, mapping these trends over time and incorporating them into sleep readings. The overall readings will give you a good picture of your numbers over time. Honestly though, I get the sense that this is really just the tip of the iceberg of future functionality.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For now, there\u2019s really no specific guidance \u2014 or context \u2014 given as far as what the numbers mean. Mine are generally between 90-100%. The Mayo Clinic tells me that\u2019s good, but obviously there are a lot of different factors and variations that can\u2019t properly be contextualized in a single paragraph &#8212; or on a watch. And Apple certainly doesn\u2019t want to be accused of attempting to diagnose a condition or offer specific medical guidance. That\u2019s going to be an increasingly difficult line for the company to walk as it gets more serious about these sorts of health tools.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If I had to venture a guess, I would say that the combination of sleep tracking in watchOS 7 and the on-board oximeter opens the door pretty nicely for something like sleep apnea tracking (again, more focused on alerts of irregularity versus diagnosis). We\u2019ve seen a small handful of companies like Withings tackle this, so it seems like a no-brainer for Apple, pending all of the regulatory requirements, et al. There are all sorts of other conditions that blood oxygen levels could potentially alert the wearer to, if not actually diagnose.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sleep was probably the biggest addition with the latest version of watchOS. This was probably the biggest blind spot for the line, compared to the competition. At the moment, the sleep tracking is, admittedly, still pretty basic. Like much of the rest of the on-board tracking, it\u2019s mostly compared with changes over time. The metrics include time in bed versus time asleep, as well as incorporating heart rate figures from the sensor\u2019s regular check-ins. More specific breakdowns, including deep versus light versus REM sleep haven\u2019t arrived yet, but will no doubt be coming sooner than later.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052166\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052166\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2052166 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg 4000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052166\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The door is also wide open for Apple to really get mindfulness right. The company has incorporated a mindfulness reminder for a while now, but it\u2019s easy to imagine how the addition of various sensors like heart rate could really improve the picture and find the company going all-in on meditation, et al. The company could partner with a big meditation name \u2014 or, more likely, disrupt things with its own offering. The forthcoming Fitness+ offering could play an important role in the growth of that category, as well.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The other issue that sleep brings to the front is battery life. I was banking on the company making big strides in the battery department \u2014 after all, a big part of sleep tracking is ensuring that you\u2019ve got enough charge to get through the night. Apple really only briefly touched on battery \u2014 though <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ifixit.com\/Teardown\/Apple+Watch+Series+6+Teardown\/136694?utm_content=buffer408ad&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\">a recent teardown<\/a> has revealed some smallish improvements on battery capacity (perhaps owing, in part, to space freed up by the dropping of Force Touch).<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The company has also made some improvements to energy efficiency, courtesy of the new silicon. Official literature puts it at a \u201cfull-day\u201d of<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>battery life, up to 18 hours. I found I was able to get through a full day with juice to spare. That\u2019s good, but the company\u2019s still got some ground to make up on that front, compared to, say, the Fitbit Sense, which is capable of getting nearly a week on a charge. I think at this point, it\u2019s fair to hold wearables to higher standards of battery life than, say, handsets. More than once, I\u2019ve found myself intermittently charging the device \u2014 20 minutes here and 20 minutes there \u2014 in order to have enough juice left by bedtime.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"GxSVdjFou2\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/29\/apple-began-work-on-the-watchs-hand-washing-feature-years-before-covid-19\/\">Apple began work on the Watch\u2019s handwashing feature years before COVID-19<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Apple began work on the Watch\u2019s handwashing feature years before COVID-19&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/29\/apple-began-work-on-the-watchs-hand-washing-feature-years-before-covid-19\/embed\/#?secret=GxSVdjFou2\" data-secret=\"GxSVdjFou2\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you can spare more time than that, you should be able to get up to 80% in an hour or 100% in an hour and a half, courtesy of faster wireless charging. All told, the company has been able to shave significant time off of charging \u2014 a definite plus now that you\u2019re not just leaving it overnight to charge. The latest version of watchOS will also handily let you know before if you don\u2019t have enough charge to make it through a full night.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Other updates include the addition of the always-on Altimeter, which, along with the brighter screen doesn\u2019t appear to have had a major impact on the battery. I\u2019ll be honest, being stuck in the city for these last several months hasn\u2019t given me much reason to need real-time elevation stats. Though the feature is a nice step toward taking the Watch a bit more seriously as an outdoor accessory in a realm that has largely been dominated by the likes of Garmin.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052167\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052167\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2052167\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg 4000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052167\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Of course, the company now has three watches on the market \u2014 including the Series 3, which just keeps on ticking, and the lower-cost SE. The latter retains the design of the Series 6, but drops a number of the key sensors, which honestly should be perfectly sufficient for many users \u2014 and $170 cheaper than the 6\u2019s $399 starting price ($499 with cellular).<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Taken as a whole, the Series 6 isn\u2019t a huge leap forward over the Series 5 \u2014 and not really worth the upgrade for those who already own that recent vintage. But there are nice improvements throughout, augmented by good upgrades to watchOS that make the best-selling smartwatch that much better, while clearly laying the groundwork for Apple Watches of the future.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/Apple-Hardware-Event-2020\/\"><img src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/apple-hardware-event-2020.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When it comes to smartwatches, it\u2019s Apple against the world.

company he runs with managing partner Mary Chan, and would be part of a consortium of investors, according to one unnamed source who requested anonymity because the deal had yet to be finalized. The deal could close as early as mid-October.<\/p>\n<p>TuSimple as well as Girsky declined to comment.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>It&#8217;s no secret that TuSimple has been seeking new capital.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/26\/tusimple-seeking-250-million-in-new-funding-to-scale-self-driving-trucks\/\">TechCrunch reported in June that TuSimple was in search of $250 million<\/a> in fresh capital from investors. The company hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to help it raise funds, according to multiple sources familiar with the effort. Since then, TuSimple, which already has backing from Sina, UPS and Tier 1 supplier Mando Corp., has announced a partnership with Navistar and most recently, the Traton Group.<\/p>\n<p>Girsky has most recently captured headlines because of Nikola, where he is now the executive chairman. Girsky took over as chairman in September after Nikola&#8217;s founder, Trevor Milton, stepped down following fallout from <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/nikola-disputes-fraud-claims-in-carefully-worded-rebuttal\/\">a scathing report<\/a> by short-seller firm Hindenburg Research that accused the company of fraud. VectoIQ Acquisition Corp., the SPAC that Girsky formed in 2018, announced a merger with Nikola in March, and Girsky oversaw its public listing this past June. He shepherded an introduction between Nikola and his former boss, GM CEO and chairwoman Mary Barra, according to one source familiar with the deal. By mid-September the automaker had announced a partnership valued at $2 billion with Nikola.<\/p>\n<p>Girsky may be Nikola&#8217;s new chairman and certainly has executive experience, but his focus in recent years has been as an advisor, investor and matchmaker. Girsky has long had an interest in mobility-related companies. His firm VectoIQ LLC specializes in advising companies and connecting large companies with startups working on autonomous vehicle technology, electrification, connected, cybersecurity and mobility-as-a-service.<\/p>\n<p>VectoIQ invested in lidar startup Luminar, which recently announced it was going public through a SPAC merger with Gores Metropoulos Inc., at a post-deal market valuation of $3.4 billion. Girsky also sat on the board of autonomous vehicle startup Drive.ai, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/06\/25\/self-driving-startup-drive-ai-is-closing-down\/\">which was acquired by Apple<\/a> as the company prepared to shut down.<\/p>\n<p>Girsky&#8217;s investment in TuSimple is separate from his interests in Nikola, which has yet to begin production of its Class 8 trucks, according to sources.<\/p>\n<p>TuSimple, which launched in 2015 and has operations in China, San Diego and Tucson, Arizona, is focused on the autonomous vehicle technology stack that will allow Class 8 trucks to operate without a human driver. TuSimple operates a fleet of 40 self-driving trucks in the U.S. that are used for testing and to carry freight between Arizona and Texas.<\/p>\n<p>TuSimple announced in July plans to develop and begin producing autonomous semi trucks by 2024 in partnership with Navistar. In September, Volkswagen AG&#8217;s heavy-truck business Traton Group said it took a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/23\/vws-traton-group-strikes-a-deal-with-tusimple-to-develop-autonomous-trucks\/\">minority stake in TuSimple<\/a> as part of an agreement between the two companies to develop self-driving trucks. Neither company disclosed the financial terms of the partnership or the percentage of the minority stake. Traton did make a direct capital investment into TuSimple, according to one unnamed source familiar with the deal. It&#8217;s unclear if it also included in-kind contributions.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Steve Girsky, the former GM vice chairman, consultant and investor whose special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merged with hydrogen electric startup Nikola this summer, is in talks to back self-driving trucks startup TuSimple, according to four people familiar with the deal.

href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1825205\/000182520520000001\/xslFormDX01\/primary_doc.xml\">According to an SEC filing<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/alexisohanian\">Alexis Ohanian<\/a>, the co-founder of Reddit and early-stage VC firm Initialized Capital, is raising a new fund, named 776, with a target of $150 million. The filing comes <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/26\/alexis-ohanian-reddit-co-founder-is-leaving-initialized-capital\/\">three months<\/a> after the entrepreneur left Initialized Capital and a month after The Information <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theinformation.com\/articles\/reddit-co-founder-alexis-ohanian-plots-new-early-stage-vc-fund\">first reported<\/a> on his plans. Ohanian declined to comment on details regarding the fund due to general solicitation restraints.<\/p>\n<p>Along the filing, the fund launched an intentionally cryptic new website:<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sevensevensix.com\/\"> sevensevensix.com<\/a>. It appears that the name of the fund is a reference to when the first Olympics were held, in 776 B.C.E.<\/p>\n<p>The website reads: &#8220;The first Olympics brought the best athletes from all over the known world to determine who was the greatest. The first competition was a 192m footrace; it was won by a cook from a nearby village. We\u2019re going back to that very first starting line.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>If I had to guess, I&#8217;d say Ohanian&#8217;s investing in pre-seed and seed startups.

But as founders flurry to a sector recently rejuvenated with capital, the influx of interest has not fostered any breakout solutions. As a result, edtech investors must hone their skills at sorting the innovators from the opportunists amid the rush.<\/p>\n<p>Lucky for us, investors shared notes during TechCrunch Disrupt and offline regarding how they are separating the gold from the sand, giving us a peek into their due diligence process (and inboxes).<\/p>\n<h2>Putting profitability over growth<\/h2>\n<p>The pandemic has broadly forced founders to get more conservative and prioritize profitability over the usual &#8220;growth at all costs&#8221; startup mentality. Growth still matters, but within edtech, the boom comes with a big focus on profitability, efficacy, outcomes and societal impact.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The goal of all of education is personalized learning, when every student receives exactly the instruction in the way that they need it at the time that they need it. And that&#8217;s really, really difficult to do if you&#8217;re trying to have one person teach 180 students,&#8221; said <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/mercedes-bent\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"mercedes-bent\">Mercedes Bent <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> of Lightspeed Venture Partners. &#8220;And so I&#8217;ve been excited to see more solutions that are focused on creating smaller class sizes that are also focused on allowing students to connect with people outside of their homes as well.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>During Disrupt, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/reach-capital\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"reach-capital\">Reach Capital&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/jennifer-carolan\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"jennifer-carolan\">Jennifer Carolan <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> brought up a recent Netflix documentary, &#8220;The Social Dilemma,&#8221; which illustrates the impact screen time can have on society.

Amazon, even though the portal is supposed to require a verified email address and password.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon&#8217;s law enforcement request portal allows police and federal agents to submit formal requests for customer data along with a legal order, like a subpoena, a search warrant, or a court order. The portal is publicly accessible from the internet, but law enforcement must register an account with the site in order to allow Amazon to &#8220;authenticate&#8221; the requesting officer&#8217;s credentials before they can make requests.<\/p>\n<p>Only time sensitive emergency requests can be submitted without an account, but this requires the user to &#8220;declare and acknowledge&#8221; that they are an authorized law enforcement officer before they can submit a request.<\/p>\n<p>The portal does not display customer data or allow access to existing law enforcement requests. But parts of the website still load without needing to log in, including its dashboard and the &#8220;standard&#8221; request form used by law enforcement to request customer data.<\/p>\n<p>The portal provides a rare glimpse into how Amazon handles law enforcement requests.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2052361\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1064\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-1.jpg 1928w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-1.jpg?resize=144,150 144w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-1.jpg?resize=289,300 289w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-1.jpg?resize=768,798 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-1.jpg?resize=654,680 654w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-1.jpg?resize=1478,1536 1478w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-1.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-1.jpg?resize=48,50 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2052362\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1119\" data-wp-editing=\"1\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-2.jpg 1928w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-2.jpg?resize=137,150 137w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-2.jpg?resize=275,300 275w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-2.jpg?resize=768,839 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-2.jpg?resize=622,680 622w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-2.jpg?resize=1406,1536 1406w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-2.jpg?resize=1874,2048 1874w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-2.jpg?resize=46,50 46w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This form allows law enforcement to request customer data using a wide variety of data points, including Amazon order numbers, serial numbers of Amazon Echo and Fire devices, credit cards details and bank account numbers, gift cards, delivery and shipping numbers, and even the Social Security number of delivery drivers.<\/p>\n<p>It also allows law enforcement to obtain records related to <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/amazon-web-services\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"amazon-web-services\">Amazon Web Services <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> accounts by submitting domain names or IP addresses related to the request.<\/p>\n<p>Assuming this was a bug, we sent Amazon several emails prior to publication but did not hear back.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon is not the only tech company with a portal for law enforcement requests.

Here&#8217;s what one founder told him:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">Many [companies] are considering manufacturing in areas like Southeast Asia and India. Vietnam, in particular, has offered an appealing proposition for a labor pool, notes Ho Chi Minh City-based Sonny Vu,\u00a0CEO of carbon-fiber products manufacturer Arevo and founder of deep tech VC fund Alabaster. \u201cWe\u2019re friendly [with] the Americans and the West in general. Vietnam, they\u2019ve got 100 million people, they can make stuff,\u201d Vu explains. \u201cThe supply chains are getting more and more sophisticated. One of the issues has been the subpar supply chain \u2026 it\u2019s not as deep and broad as as other places like China. That\u2019s changing really fast and people are willing to do manufacturing. I\u2019ve heard from my friends trying to make stuff in China, labor\u2019s always this chronic issue.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Danny Crichton <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/20\/gangster-capitalism-and-the-american-theft-of-chinese-innovation\/\">blamed nationalistic US policies<\/a> for undermining the country&#8217;s long-term commitment to leading global free trade and threatening its competitive future, in a provocative rant last weekend. There&#8217;s truth to that, but the underlying truth is that globalization worked, it just hasn&#8217;t work as well as hoped for a lot of people in the US and some other parts of the world. In addition to phenomenon like China&#8217;s industrial engine, for example, those cross-border flows of money and technology have helped nurture the startup ecosystem in Europe.<\/p>\n<p>Mike Butcher, who has been covering startups for TechCrunch from London since last decade, writes about <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/23\/new-research-shows-european-startups-are-spending-drastically-less-on-a-us-launch-for-the-same-gains\/\">a new report from Index Ventures about this trend<\/a>.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>It used to be the case that in order to scale globally, European companies needed to spend big on launching in the U.S. to achieve the kind of growth they wanted. That usually meant relocating large swathes of the team to the San Francisco Bay Area, or New York. New research suggests that is no longer the case, as the U.S. has become more expensive, and as the opportunity in Europe has improved. This means European startups are committing much less of their team and resources to a U.S. launch, but still getting decent results&#8230;. Between 2008-2014, almost two-thirds (59%) of European startups expanded, or moved entirely, to the U.S. ahead of Series A funding rounds. However, between 2015-2019, this number decreased to a third (33%).<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The report also highlights the economic problem of dividing up markets into political blocks. &#8220;European corporates invest three-quarters (76%) less than their U.S. counterparts on software,&#8221; Butcher adds about the report. &#8220;And this is normally on compliance rather than innovation. This means European startups are likely to continue to look to the U.S. for exits to corporates.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The pain from failing to trade will come home sooner or later to each government, as Danny observes. But that could be longer than your current company exists. Instead, now is the time to pick the markets you can win, and plan for a world where success has a lower ceiling. And hey, if you&#8217;re lucky, your national government could pick you as its winner!<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052333\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052333\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2052333\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/VineetJain.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1103\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/VineetJain.jpg 1300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/VineetJain.jpg?resize=139,150 139w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/VineetJain.jpg?resize=279,300 279w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/VineetJain.jpg?resize=768,827 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/VineetJain.jpg?resize=631,680 631w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/VineetJain.jpg?resize=46,50 46w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052333\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/egnyte.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Egnyte <\/a><span class=\"screen-reader-text\"><a href=\"http:\/\/egnyte.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">(opens in a new window)<\/a><\/span><\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<h2>Want $100m ARR? Fix your churn<\/h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve been recapping key moments from the Extra Crunch Stage at Disrupt this week, here&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/23\/scaling-to-100-million-arr-3-founders-share-their-insights\/\">a key segment from a panel Alex Wilhelm hosted<\/a> about how to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/12\/10\/the-100m-arr-club\/\">achieve the $100m ARR dream<\/a>, featuring Egnyte CEO Vineet Jain:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>After explaining that in the early stages of building a SaaS company it\u2019s common to focus more on adding new revenue than \u201cplugging the holes at the bottom,\u201d [Jain] added that as a company matures and grows, more focus has to be paid to managing churn and retention.

Apps can now be stored off screen in the new App Library where they&#8217;re organized for you, as opposed to you being forced to categorize apps yourself into various folders. And <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> finally allows for home screen widgets &#8212; a development that left Android users snickering about how &#8220;behind&#8221; their iPhone-using counterparts have been all this time.<\/p>\n<p>But as with iOS apps, Apple&#8217;s design constraints and rules around widgets mean there&#8217;s a standard that all widgets have to meet to be approved. As a result, widgets have a consistent look-and-feel, thanks to things like size limitations and other design guidelines. They can&#8217;t be stretched out indefinitely or moved all over the screen, either.<\/p>\n<p>Apple may have originally envisioned widgets as a way for existing iOS apps to gain a larger presence on users&#8217; home screens, while delivering key information like news, weather or stock updates, for example. But<a href=\"https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/creating-your-own-widgets-a-new-category-of-apps-emerges\/\"> a handful of iOS developers<\/a> instead built apps that allowed users to design widgets themselves &#8212; by selecting colors, fonts, sizes, backgrounds and what information the widget would display.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, TikTok users and other Gen Z&#8217;ers began teaching each other how to create custom icons for their apps using Apple&#8217;s Shortcuts app. These tutorials were starting to trend even before iOS 14&#8217;s release, but the addition of the App Library and widgets meant users could now <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/21\/how-to-make-the-most-of-ios-14-widgets-and-iphone-home-screen-customization\/\">finally customize their entire home screen<\/a>. That prompted a more enthusiastic adoption of the icon customization technique.<\/p>\n<p>On the Twitter hashtag #iOS14homescreen, users shared their creations &#8212; a showcase of creativity where home screens looked fully themed at last, with custom icons, widgets, decorative photos, matching wallpapers and more. <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/i\/events\/1308127358038179843?s=20\">The results have been fantastic.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>And at the top of the App Store, there now sit a trio of must-have tools for this new era: Widgetsmith, Color Widgets and Photo Widget today continue to claim the top three spots on the free apps chart.<\/p>\n<p>Users are also now demanding Apple to change how app shortcuts open. Currently, an app shortcut first launches Apple&#8217;s Shortcuts app, which then opens the target app. With the popularity of custom icons, users want that intermediate step cut out.<\/p>\n<p>Apple is aware of the customization craze as it has in the days since iOS 14&#8217;s release run App Store editorial features about iOS 14&#8217;s design changes, suggested widgets to try, creative tools and more. It also featured apps at the top of the App Store, which are benefiting from the trend, like apps offering great widgets, like Fantastical, or those that are booming, like Pinterest &#8212; which <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/22\/pinterest-breaks-daily-download-record-thanks-to-user-interest-in-ios-14-design-ideas\/\">recently broke<\/a> its daily download record.<\/p>\n<h2>App makers team up to take on Apple and Google<\/h2>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\">A number of top app makers have banded together to fight against\u00a0<a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/apple\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple\u2019s <\/a>control of its App Store and, to a lesser extent, Google\u2019s control of the Play Store \u2014 a topic of increased regulatory scrutiny in recent months. Today, 13 app publishers, including Epic Games, Deezer, Basecamp, Tile, Spotify and others, have launched the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/appfairness.org\/\">Coalition for App Fairness<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The new organization formalizes efforts the companies already have underway that focus on either forcing app store providers to change their policies, or ultimately pushing the app stores into regulation.<\/p>\n<p>On the coalition\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/appfairness.org\/\">website<\/a>, the group details its key issues, which include anti-competitive practices, like the app stores\u2019 30% commission structure, and the inability to distribute software to billions of Apple devices through any other means but the App Store, which the group sees as an affront to personal freedom.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/google\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> allows apps to be side-loaded, so it\u2019s not as much of a target on this front. In fact, much of the focus of the coalition\u2019s efforts have to do with Apple\u2019s business, given its stricter guidelines.<\/p>\n<p>The group has also published a list of 10 \u201cApp Store Principles\u201d it would like to see enacted industry-wide. These include the ability to distribute apps outside of app stores, protections from having their own data used against them to compete, timely access to developer documentation, the right to communicate with users through its app for legitimate business purposes, no requirements to use the app store\u2019s payment systems, no requirements to pay unfair fees and more.<\/p>\n<p>The website is also aiming to recruit new members to join the coalition. App makers who feel similarly oppressed by Apple\u2019s practices are able to fill out a form to request to join.<\/p>\n<p>Apple responded to the hardball tactics with a barrage of new material and data meant to highlight the benefits of its App Store platform. The company on Thursday <a href=\"https:\/\/appleinsider.com\/articles\/20\/09\/24\/app-store-rejected-150000-apps-in-2020-is-seeing-100000-submissions-per-week\">revealed the number<\/a> of rejections it enforces is quite low compared to the number of submissions. It said it rejected 150,000 apps in 2020 but sees 100,000 submissions per week. It also has removed more than 60 million user reviews it believed to be spam.<\/p>\n<p>The company noted its Developer program has over 28 million developers worldwide, whose apps have seen over 50 billion promotions &#8212; meaning when a user sees an app Apple has promoted on the App Store, in emails, on social media or in other general advertising.<\/p>\n<p>However, the backlash has also <a href=\"https:\/\/appleinsider.com\/articles\/20\/09\/24\/apple-clarifies-details-on-video-partner-program-for-developers\">forced Apple to be more transparent<\/a> about some of its until-now fairly secretive programs. For example, Apple has <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/programs\/video-partner\/\">now published a page<\/a> that clarifies how its Video Partner program works &#8212; a program that had before only been detailed via background conversations with reporters who then relayed the information to readers. The page reveals the program&#8217;s requirements and that over 130 premium subscription video entertainment providers have since joined. If the guidelines are followed, these providers can pay only a 15% commission to Apple instead of 20%.<\/p>\n<p>Current members include Amazon Prime Video, Binge, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), Claro, C More, DAZN, Disney+, Globo, HBO Max, Joyn, Molotov, MUBI, myCanal, STARZ and Viaplay, the website said.<\/p>\n<h2>TikTok deal chaos continues<\/h2>\n<p>No, seriously, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/21\/tiktok-wtf\/\">what is going on<\/a> with the TikTok deal?

The move came shortly after WeChat users <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/20\/trump-administrations-wechat-ban-is-blocked-by-u-s-district-court\/\">were granted<\/a> an injunction in a federal court last week that blocked the app from being banned.

class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/nasa\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"nasa\">NASA <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/press-release\/nasa-report-details-how-agency-significantly-benefits-us-economy\">released its first-ever agency-wide economic report<\/a>, documenting the agency&#8217;s impact on the nation&#8217;s jobs and cash flow. Everyone knew NASA was impactful, but now we know exactly how impactful it is, some $64 billion and more than 300,000 jobs&#8217; worth in FY2019.<\/p>\n<p>It seems clear that the 2,670-page report is meant to show just how valuable the agency is to the country, and how it&#8217;s very much an investment in the economy and not, as some suggest, a hole we throw money into and pull science out of. The major points it makes are these:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>NASA itself employs more than 18,000 civil servants, but 17 additional jobs in the economy are &#8220;supported&#8221; (of this later) for every full-timer at the agency, for a total of around 312,000 total jobs.<\/li>\n<li>NASA supports almost $24 billion in labor income yearly, as well as a total economic output of $64.3 billion.<\/li>\n<li>$6.9 billion in additional tax revenues can be attributed to the agency&#8217;s work.<\/li>\n<li>About 22% of this overall effect is due to the &#8220;Moon to Mars&#8221; program, the current 10-ish year plan to return to those locations.<\/li>\n<li>Moon to Mars programs <em>within<\/em> NASA account for only 2.4% of the overall employment impact, but related <em>procurement<\/em> makes up almost 20% of it. (In other words, the &#8220;M2M&#8221; programs are hugely weighted toward contractors.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&#8220;Support&#8221; is interpreted broadly, though not necessarily overly so \u2014 it&#8217;s a standard model going back to the &#8217;70s, a NASA representative explained. Essentially, NASA&#8217;s direct payroll and procurement budgets are one thing, but they may lead to increased demand for goods and services in general, and increased spending by companies, consumers and local governments. So a NASA contractor doing $5 million worth of composites work also produces demand in the city it&#8217;s based in for logistics work, business services, food and other everyday needs \u2014 perhaps to the tune of twice the money actually spent by NASA.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"olJANvbf6W\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/10\/2021-nasa-budget-request-includes-3-3b-for-human-lunar-landers-430m-for-moon-resource-development\/\">2021 NASA budget request includes $3.3B for human lunar landers, $430M for Moon resource development<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;2021 NASA budget request includes $3.3B for human lunar landers, $430M for Moon resource development&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/10\/2021-nasa-budget-request-includes-3-3b-for-human-lunar-landers-430m-for-moon-resource-development\/embed\/#?secret=olJANvbf6W\" data-secret=\"olJANvbf6W\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The report goes into remarkably fine detail on the thousands of industries it supports in direct and indirect ways. For instance, on page 138 of the appendix (page 493 overall), we find that NASA supports 66 jobs in the sheet metal manufacturing world, worth about $4 million in labor, adding nearly $6 million in value itself, and producing a total positive economic impact of about $14 million. Then there&#8217;s the 91 jobs in fabricated metal structures, the 13 in heavy gauge metal tank manufacturing, seven in cutlery, utensil, pot and pan manufacturing&#8230; and so on, for many pages.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes these connections seem a bit tenuous. How does NASA support small arms manufacturing and produce a $4 million economic impact, or support the tortilla industry to a similar degree? It seems these are extrapolated as indirect effects of the broader impact of having a NASA-sourced project in town. A major research center can support a lot of taco trucks.<\/p>\n<p>The final picture is simple enough, however: NASA is a huge force in our economy and one that repays its investment several times over, even when you don&#8217;t account for the &#8220;value&#8221; of exploring and understanding our universe.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also broken down by state, a convenient way for members of Congress to justify NASA&#8217;s budget to their constituents, should they need convincing. When some of those billions could be spent on PPE and pandemic response rather than what some may perceive as research and programs with no immediate practical benefit, it&#8217;s important to be able to show how the agency is more than just an expense.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Perhaps anticipating budget pushback from the federal government, NASA has released its first-ever agency-wide economic report, documenting the agency&#8217;s impact on the nation&#8217;s jobs and cash flow.

empower business users with predictive analytics.\t<\/div>\n\t\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">The machine learning<\/span> and AI-powered tools being deployed in response to COVID-19 arguably improve certain human activities and provide essential insights needed to make certain personal or professional decisions; however, they also highlight a few pervasive challenges faced by both machines and the humans that create them.<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the progress seen in AI\/machine learning leading up to and during the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be ignored. This global economic and public health crisis brings with it a unique opportunity for updates and innovation in modeling, so long as certain underlying principles are followed.<\/p>\n<p>Here are four industry truths (note: this is not an exhaustive list) my colleagues and I have found that matter in any design climate, but <em>especially<\/em> during a global pandemic climate.<\/p>\n<h2>Some success can be attributed to chance, rather than reasoning<\/h2>\n<p>When a big group of people is collectively working on a problem, success may become more likely. Looking at historic examples like the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, there were several analysts <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/templates\/story\/story.php?storyId=97801606\">credited<\/a> with predicting the crisis. This may seem miraculous to some until you consider that more than 200,000 people were working in Wall Street, each of them making their own predictions. It then becomes less of a miracle and more of a statistically probable outcome. With this many individuals simultaneously working on modeling and predictions, it was highly likely someone would get it right by chance.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, with COVID-19 there are a lot of people involved, from statistical modelers and data scientists to vaccine specialists, and there is also an overwhelming eagerness to find solutions and concrete data-based answers. Following appropriate statistical rigor, coupled with machine learning and AI, can improve these models and decrease the chances of false predictions that arrive from too many predictions being made.<\/p>\n<h2>Automation can help in maintaining productivity if used wisely<\/h2>\n<p>During a crisis, time-management is essential. Automation technology can be used not only as part of the crisis solution, but also as a tool for monitoring productivity and contributions of team members working on the solution. For modeling, automation can also greatly improve the speed of results. Every second a piece of software can perform automation for a model, it allows a data scientist (or even a medical scientist) to conduct other more important tasks.

Now, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/github\/renaming\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Microsoft-owned GitHub is gearing up to remove these references<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to slavery by naming primary code repositories \u201cmain\u201d instead of \u201cmaster.\u201d These changes will go into effect on October 1.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GitHub talked about making these changes as early as June, when <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/natfriedman\/status\/1271253144442253312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1271253144442253312%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zdnet.com%2Farticle%2Fgithub-to-replace-master-with-alternative-term-to-avoid-slavery-references%2F\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CEO Nat Friedman tweeted<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that it was something the company was already working on. But GitHub is by no means the first company to consider and make these changes. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/node\/2275877\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2014<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, open-source platform Drupal moved to replace \u201cmaster\/slave\u201d with \u201cprimary\/replica.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of its reasons for making the change was, \u201cThe word &#8216;slave&#8217; has negative connotations (although this might or might not be relevant in the naming of a technical term) including multi-century history of slavery to benefit European colonial powers, prison laborers today forced to work in conditions at times resembling that slavery, young girls sold into sex slavery in many parts of the world today.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, in 2018, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en_us\/article\/8x7akv\/masterslave-terminology-was-removed-from-python-programming-language\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">programming language Python ditched the racist terminology<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Meanwhile, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/twitter-engineers-replace-racially-loaded-tech-terms-like-master-slave\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter began taking steps to replace those terms earlier this year<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and hopes to finish replacing that terminology by the end of 2021, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/twitter-engineers-replace-racially-loaded-tech-terms-like-master-slave\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">according to CNET<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What\u2019s wild is that these terms ever existed in the first place and are just now being addressed. <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2003\/TECH\/ptech\/11\/26\/master.term.reut\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Los Angeles city officials way back in 2003 asked its<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> manufacturers and suppliers to stop using the terminology, they did not require it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So perhaps it\u2019s no wonder why some tech companies struggle to retain Black employees. In 2019, for example, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/28\/google-retention-black-latinx-native-american\/\">Google reported<\/a> its attrition rates of Black and Latinx talent &#8212; which indicate the rate at which employees leave on an annual basis &#8212; were higher than the national average.

In a survey of 5,900 likely voters, UC Berkeley&#8217;s IGS found that 39% of voters would vote yes on Prop 22 while 36% said they would vote no. The other 25% are undecided.<\/p>\n<p>As we mentioned last week, the Yes on 22 campaign has put in about $180 million into the campaign while the No on 22 side has put in about $4.6 million.

In the appeals court, which granted a stay on the preliminary injunction that would force Uber and Lyft to immediately reclassify their drivers, a number of amicus briefs have been filed.<\/p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nelp.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/People-v.-Uber-Lyft-Application-Amici-Curiae.pdf\">brief filed by the National Employment Law Group, the ACLU and other civil rights groups<\/a>, they say Uber and Lyft harm workers of color by classifying them as independent contractors:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Many poor workers of color and immigrants are stuck in a separate and unequal economy where they are underpaid, put in harm\u2019s way on the job, and left to fend for themselves without access to paid sick leave, unemployment insurance, workers\u2019 compensation, and other protections. By insisting that their drivers are not employees, Lyft and Uber further distance workers of colors from the bedrock workplace rights that provide real flexibility and economic security. Instead, their business models trap poor workers into intractable cycles of poverty and economic exclusion.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In the event Uber and Lyft are forced to reclassify their drivers, both Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and Lyft CEO Logan Green filed sworn statements earlier this month that confirmed they both have plans to comply with an order requiring them to reclassify their respective workforces.<\/p>\n<p>In Khosrowshahi&#8217;s statement, he simply said &#8220;Uber has developed implementation plans&#8221; to comply with an order within no more than 30 days. In Green&#8217;s statement, he said &#8220;such an implementation may include ceasing rideshare operations in all or some parts of California.&#8221;<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Don&#8217;t Miss<\/h2>\n<hr \/>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/21\/twitter-and-zoom-algorithmic-bias-issues\/\">Twitter and Zoom&#8217;s algorithmic bias issues &#8211; TechCrunch<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vice.com\/amp\/en_us\/article\/m7jz7b\/amazon-employee-warns-internal-groups-theyre-being-monitored-for-labor-organizing?__twitter_impression=true\">Amazon Employee Warns Internal Groups They\u2019re Being Monitored For Labor Organizing &#8211; Motherboard<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.geekwire.com\/2020\/bezos-academy-funded-jeff-bezos-2b-day-one-fund-launches-first-free-school-seattle-area\/\">Bezos Academy, funded by Jeff Bezos\u2019 $2B \u2018Day One Fund,\u2019 launches first free school in Seattle area &#8211; GeekWire<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/09\/25\/alphabet-settles-shareholder-lawsuit-.html?__source=twitter%7Cmain\">Alphabet settles shareholder lawsuit over alleged mishandling of sexual misconduct by execs &#8211; CNBC<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@emergentworks\/meet-the-formerly-incarcerated-software-engineers-who-built-a-no-police-alternative-to-911-5a5af163f8b2\">Meet the Formerly Incarcerated Software Engineers who Built a No-Police Alternative to 911<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have tips?

href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/alexisohanian\">Alexis Ohanian<\/a>, the co-founder of Reddit and early-stage VC firm Initialized Capital, is raising a new fund, named 776, with a target of $150

The filing comes <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/26\/alexis-ohanian-reddit-co-founder-is-leaving-initialized-capital\/\">three months<\/a> after the entrepreneur left Initialized Capital and a month after The Information <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theinformation.com\/articles\/reddit-co-founder-alexis-ohanian-plots-new-early-stage-vc-fund\">first reported<\/a> on his plans. Ohanian declined to comment on details regarding the fund due to general solicitation restraints.<\/p>\n<p>Along the filing, the fund launched an intentionally cryptic new website:<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sevensevensix.com\/\"> sevensevensix.com<\/a>. It appears that the name of the fund is a reference to when the first Olympics were held, in 776 B.C.E.<\/p>\n<p>The website reads: &#8220;The first Olympics brought the best athletes from all over the known world to determine who was the greatest. The first competition was a 192m footrace; it was won by a cook from a nearby village. We\u2019re going back to that very first starting line.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>If I had to guess, I&#8217;d say Ohanian&#8217;s investing in pre-seed and seed startups.

Watch Series 6 review"},"content":{"rendered":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">When it comes<\/span> to smartwatches, it\u2019s Apple against the world. It\u2019s not that there aren\u2019t plenty of other products to choose from \u2014 it\u2019s more that the company has just utterly dominated the space to such a point that any other device is relegated to the realm of \u201c<a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Watch alternatives.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The company has been successful in the space for the usual Apple reasons: premium hardware with deeply integrated software, third-party support, a large cross-device ecosystem play and, of, course, simplicity. Taken as a whole, the Watch just works, right out of the box.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Five years after launch, the line is fairly mature. As such, it\u2019s no surprise, really, that recent updates have largely amounted to refinements. As with most updates, the watch has gotten a processor boost up to the A14 processor, which the company claims is 20% faster than the last version.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>Perhaps the biggest hardware upgrade, however, is the addition of a blood oxygen sensor, an important piece in the company\u2019s quest to offer as complete an image of wearer health as is possible from the wrist.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Dkvjc9vzsO\"><p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/a-closer-look-at-the-new-apple-watches\/\">A closer look at the new Apple Watches<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;A closer look at the new Apple Watches&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/a-closer-look-at-the-new-apple-watches\/embed\/#?secret=Dkvjc9vzsO\" data-secret=\"Dkvjc9vzsO\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">I wrote<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/a-closer-look-at-the-new-apple-watches\/\"> a pretty lengthy piece<\/a> about the watch last week after wearing it for a few days. As I mentioned at the time, it was an odd kind of writeup, somewhere between hands-on and review. A week or so later, however, I\u2019m more comfortable calling this a review \u2014 even if not too many of my initial impressions have changed much in the past several days. After all, a mature product largely means most of the foundations remain unchanged.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Series 6 certainly looks the part. The Watch is tough to distinguish from other recent models \u2014 and for that matter, the new and significantly cheaper SE. The biggest visual change is the addition of new colors. In addition to the standard Gray and Gold, Apple\u2019s added new Blue and (Product)Red cases. The latter seems to be the more ostentatious of the pair. The company sent me a blue model, and honestly, it\u2019s a lot more subtle than I expected. It\u2019s more of a deep blue hue, really, that reads more as black a lot of the time.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s tough to imagine the product undergoing any sort of radical rethink of the device\u2019s design language at this point. We may see slight tweaks, including larger screen area going forward, but on the whole, Apple is very much committed to a form factor that has worked very well for it. I will probably always prefer Samsung\u2019s spinning bezel as a quick way to interface with the operating system, but the crown does the job well and scrolling through menus even feels a bit zippier this time, perhaps owing to that faster silicon.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"LWNvL7GOH3\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/you-can-now-return-apples-solo-loop-for-a-new-size-without-sending-back-the-watch\/\">You can now return Apple\u2019s Solo Loop for a new size, without sending back the Watch<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;You can now return Apple\u2019s Solo Loop for a new size, without sending back the Watch&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/you-can-now-return-apples-solo-loop-for-a-new-size-without-sending-back-the-watch\/embed\/#?secret=LWNvL7GOH3\" data-secret=\"LWNvL7GOH3\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">The new Solo Loop bands hit a bit of a hiccup out of the gate. I\u2019ve <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/you-can-now-return-apples-solo-loop-for-a-new-size-without-sending-back-the-watch\/\">detailed that a bit more here<\/a>, but I suspect that much of the problem came down to the difficulty of selling a specifically sized product during a strange period in history where in-person try-ons aren\u2019t really an option. In other words, just really bad timing on that front.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Personally, I quite like the braided model. I\u2019ve been using it as my day to day band. It\u2019s nice and blends in a lot better than the silicone model (I\u2019ve frankly never been much of a fan of Apple\u2019s silicone bands). But I do need to mention that Apple sent me a couple different sizes, which made it much easier to find the right fit. I recognize that. Especially when the braided Solo Loop costs a fairly exorbitant $99. The silicone version is significantly cheaper at $49, but either way, you\u2019re not getting off cheap there. So you definitely want to make sure you get the right fit.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052164\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052164\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2052164\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg 4000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052164\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This is doubly important given the fact that the Series 6\u2019s biggest new feature \u2014 blood oxygen monitoring \u2014 is highly dependent on you getting a good fit. The sensor utilizes a series of LEDs on the bottom of the watch to shine infrared and red light through the wearer\u2019s skin and into their blood vessels. The color of light that reflects back gives the watch a picture of the oxygen levels in the blood. The whole thing takes about 15 seconds, but only works if your fit is right. Even with the right Solo Loop on, I found myself having to retake it a few times when I first started wearing the watch.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Beyond the on-demand measurements, the watch will also take readings throughout the day and night, mapping these trends over time and incorporating them into sleep readings. The overall readings will give you a good picture of your numbers over time. Honestly though, I get the sense that this is really just the tip of the iceberg of future functionality.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For now, there\u2019s really no specific guidance \u2014 or context \u2014 given as far as what the numbers mean. Mine are generally between 90-100%. The Mayo Clinic tells me that\u2019s good, but obviously there are a lot of different factors and variations that can\u2019t properly be contextualized in a single paragraph &#8212; or on a watch. And Apple certainly doesn\u2019t want to be accused of attempting to diagnose a condition or offer specific medical guidance. That\u2019s going to be an increasingly difficult line for the company to walk as it gets more serious about these sorts of health tools.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If I had to venture a guess, I would say that the combination of sleep tracking in watchOS 7 and the on-board oximeter opens the door pretty nicely for something like sleep apnea tracking (again, more focused on alerts of irregularity versus diagnosis). We\u2019ve seen a small handful of companies like Withings tackle this, so it seems like a no-brainer for Apple, pending all of the regulatory requirements, et al. There are all sorts of other conditions that blood oxygen levels could potentially alert the wearer to, if not actually diagnose.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sleep was probably the biggest addition with the latest version of watchOS. This was probably the biggest blind spot for the line, compared to the competition. At the moment, the sleep tracking is, admittedly, still pretty basic. Like much of the rest of the on-board tracking, it\u2019s mostly compared with changes over time. The metrics include time in bed versus time asleep, as well as incorporating heart rate figures from the sensor\u2019s regular check-ins. More specific breakdowns, including deep versus light versus REM sleep haven\u2019t arrived yet, but will no doubt be coming sooner than later.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052166\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052166\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2052166 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg 4000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052166\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The door is also wide open for Apple to really get mindfulness right. The company has incorporated a mindfulness reminder for a while now, but it\u2019s easy to imagine how the addition of various sensors like heart rate could really improve the picture and find the company going all-in on meditation, et al. The company could partner with a big meditation name \u2014 or, more likely, disrupt things with its own offering. The forthcoming Fitness+ offering could play an important role in the growth of that category, as well.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The other issue that sleep brings to the front is battery life. I was banking on the company making big strides in the battery department \u2014 after all, a big part of sleep tracking is ensuring that you\u2019ve got enough charge to get through the night. Apple really only briefly touched on battery \u2014 though <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ifixit.com\/Teardown\/Apple+Watch+Series+6+Teardown\/136694?utm_content=buffer408ad&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\">a recent teardown<\/a> has revealed some smallish improvements on battery capacity (perhaps owing, in part, to space freed up by the dropping of Force Touch).<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The company has also made some improvements to energy efficiency, courtesy of the new silicon. Official literature puts it at a \u201cfull-day\u201d of<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>battery life, up to 18 hours. I found I was able to get through a full day with juice to spare. That\u2019s good, but the company\u2019s still got some ground to make up on that front, compared to, say, the Fitbit Sense, which is capable of getting nearly a week on a charge. I think at this point, it\u2019s fair to hold wearables to higher standards of battery life than, say, handsets. More than once, I\u2019ve found myself intermittently charging the device \u2014 20 minutes here and 20 minutes there \u2014 in order to have enough juice left by bedtime.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"GxSVdjFou2\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/29\/apple-began-work-on-the-watchs-hand-washing-feature-years-before-covid-19\/\">Apple began work on the Watch\u2019s handwashing feature years before COVID-19<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Apple began work on the Watch\u2019s handwashing feature years before COVID-19&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/29\/apple-began-work-on-the-watchs-hand-washing-feature-years-before-covid-19\/embed\/#?secret=GxSVdjFou2\" data-secret=\"GxSVdjFou2\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you can spare more time than that, you should be able to get up to 80% in an hour or 100% in an hour and a half, courtesy of faster wireless charging. All told, the company has been able to shave significant time off of charging \u2014 a definite plus now that you\u2019re not just leaving it overnight to charge. The latest version of watchOS will also handily let you know before if you don\u2019t have enough charge to make it through a full night.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Other updates include the addition of the always-on Altimeter, which, along with the brighter screen doesn\u2019t appear to have had a major impact on the battery. I\u2019ll be honest, being stuck in the city for these last several months hasn\u2019t given me much reason to need real-time elevation stats. Though the feature is a nice step toward taking the Watch a bit more seriously as an outdoor accessory in a realm that has largely been dominated by the likes of Garmin.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052167\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052167\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2052167\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg 4000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052167\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Of course, the company now has three watches on the market \u2014 including the Series 3, which just keeps on ticking, and the lower-cost SE. The latter retains the design of the Series 6, but drops a number of the key sensors, which honestly should be perfectly sufficient for many users \u2014 and $170 cheaper than the 6\u2019s $399 starting price ($499 with cellular).<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Taken as a whole, the Series 6 isn\u2019t a huge leap forward over the Series 5 \u2014 and not really worth the upgrade for those who already own that recent vintage.

company he runs with managing partner Mary Chan, and would be part of a consortium of investors, according to one unnamed source who requested anonymity because the deal had yet to be finalized. The deal could close as early as mid-October.<\/p>\n<p>TuSimple as well as Girsky declined to comment.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>It&#8217;s no secret that TuSimple has been seeking new capital.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/26\/tusimple-seeking-250-million-in-new-funding-to-scale-self-driving-trucks\/\">TechCrunch reported in June that TuSimple was in search of $250 million<\/a> in fresh capital from investors. The company hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to help it raise funds, according to multiple sources familiar with the effort. Since then, TuSimple, which already has backing from Sina, UPS and Tier 1 supplier Mando Corp., has announced a partnership with Navistar and most recently, the Traton Group.<\/p>\n<p>Girsky has most recently captured headlines because of Nikola, where he is now the executive chairman. Girsky took over as chairman in September after Nikola&#8217;s founder, Trevor Milton, stepped down following fallout from <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/nikola-disputes-fraud-claims-in-carefully-worded-rebuttal\/\">a scathing report<\/a> by short-seller firm Hindenburg Research that accused the company of fraud. VectoIQ Acquisition Corp., the SPAC that Girsky formed in 2018, announced a merger with Nikola in March, and Girsky oversaw its public listing this past June. He shepherded an introduction between Nikola and his former boss, GM CEO and chairwoman Mary Barra, according to one source familiar with the deal. By mid-September the automaker had announced a partnership valued at $2 billion with Nikola.<\/p>\n<p>Girsky may be Nikola&#8217;s new chairman and certainly has executive experience, but his focus in recent years has been as an advisor, investor and matchmaker. Girsky has long had an interest in mobility-related companies. His firm VectoIQ LLC specializes in advising companies and connecting large companies with startups working on autonomous vehicle technology, electrification, connected, cybersecurity and mobility-as-a-service.<\/p>\n<p>VectoIQ invested in lidar startup Luminar, which recently announced it was going public through a SPAC merger with Gores Metropoulos Inc., at a post-deal market valuation of $3.4 billion. Girsky also sat on the board of autonomous vehicle startup Drive.ai, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/06\/25\/self-driving-startup-drive-ai-is-closing-down\/\">which was acquired by Apple<\/a> as the company prepared to shut down.<\/p>\n<p>Girsky&#8217;s investment in TuSimple is separate from his interests in Nikola, which has yet to begin production of its Class 8 trucks, according to sources.<\/p>\n<p>TuSimple, which launched in 2015 and has operations in China, San Diego and Tucson, Arizona, is focused on the autonomous vehicle technology stack that will allow Class 8 trucks to operate without a human driver. TuSimple operates a fleet of 40 self-driving trucks in the U.S. that are used for testing and to carry freight between Arizona and Texas.<\/p>\n<p>TuSimple announced in July plans to develop and begin producing autonomous semi trucks by 2024 in partnership with Navistar. In September, Volkswagen AG&#8217;s heavy-truck business Traton Group said it took a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/23\/vws-traton-group-strikes-a-deal-with-tusimple-to-develop-autonomous-trucks\/\">minority stake in TuSimple<\/a> as part of an agreement between the two companies to develop self-driving trucks. Neither company disclosed the financial terms of the partnership or the percentage of the minority stake. Traton did make a direct capital investment into TuSimple, according to one unnamed source familiar with the deal. It&#8217;s unclear if it also included in-kind contributions.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Steve Girsky, the former GM vice chairman, consultant and investor whose special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merged with hydrogen electric startup Nikola this summer, is in talks to back self-driving trucks startup TuSimple, according to four people familiar with the deal.

The very definition of privacy data is evolving over time and has been broadened to include information concerning an individual\u2019s health, wealth, college grades, geolocation and web surfing behaviors. Regulations are proliferating at state, national and international levels that seek to define privacy data and establish controls governing its maintenance and use.<\/p>\n<p>Existing regulations are relatively new and are being translated into operational business practices through a series of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.complianceweek.com\/gdpr\/two-years-in-gdpr-defined-by-mixed-signals-unbalanced-enforcement\/28972.article?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Newsletter%20Weekly%20Roundup:%20CIO%20Dive:%20Daily%20Dive%2006-06-2020&amp;utm_term=CIO%20Dive%20Weekender\">judicial challenges that are currently in progress<\/a>, adding to the confusion regarding proper data handling procedures. In this confusing and sometimes chaotic environment, the privacy risks faced by almost every corporation are frequently ambiguous, constantly changing and continually expanding.<\/p>\n<p>Conventional information security (infosec) tools are designed to prevent the inadvertent loss or intentional theft of sensitive information. They are not sufficient to prevent the mismanagement of privacy data. Privacy safeguards not only need to prevent loss or theft but they must also prevent the inappropriate exposure or unauthorized usage of such data, <em>even when no loss or breach has occurred<\/em>. A new generation of infosec tools is needed to address the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bvp.com\/atlas\/how-data-privacy-engineering-will-prevent-future-data-oil-spills\">unique risks associated with the management of privacy data<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>The first wave of innovation<\/h2>\n<p>A variety of privacy-focused security tools emerged over the past few years, triggered in part by the introduction of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/01\/20\/wtf-is-gdpr\/\">GDPR<\/a> (General Data Protection Regulation) within the European Union in 2018. New capabilities introduced by this first wave of innovation were focused in the following three areas:<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Data discovery, classification and cataloging.<\/em><\/strong> Modern enterprises collect a wide variety of personal information from customers, business partners and employees at different times for different purposes with different IT systems. This data is frequently disseminated throughout a company\u2019s application portfolio via APIs, collaboration tools, automation bots and wholesale replication. Maintaining an accurate catalog of the location of such data is a major challenge and a perpetual activity. BigID, DataGuise and Integris Software have gained prominence as popular solutions for data discovery. Collibra and Alation are leaders in providing complementary capabilities for data cataloging.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Consent management.<\/em><\/strong> Individuals are commonly presented with privacy statements describing the intended use and safeguards that will be employed in handling the personal data they supply to corporations. They consent to these statements &#8212; either explicitly or implicitly &#8212; at the time such data is initially collected. Osano, Transcend.io and DataGrail.io specialize in the management of consent agreements and the enforcement of their terms. These tools enable individuals to exercise their consensual data rights, such as the right to view, edit or delete personal information they\u2019ve provided in the past.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Investments in privacy tools and management practices now are almost certain to deliver major business dividends in the future.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":133574325,"featured_media":2052140,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","carmot_uuid":"17c81777-361a-3513-882c-e6d04606e0c1"},"categories":[424613844,25515,449557044,426637499,21587494,20429],"tags":[651,12374,14907,576747132,35064,5564,449558007,46740,449551932,2720,18326,40978,3279,621903],"crunchbase_tag":[306786874],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[576796356],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/GettyImages-913014074.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/308dVtS","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"featured":false,"subtitle":"","fundingRound":false,"seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","premiumContent":true,"premiumCutoffPercent":0.44,"tc_cb_mapping":[{"slug":"european-union","cb_name":"European Union","cb_slug":"european-union-organization","cb_link":"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/european-union"}],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[2052125,2052128],"hideFeaturedImage":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2051668"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2051668"}],"version-history":[{"count":9,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2051668\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2052181,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2051668\/revisions\/2052181"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/mark-settle"},{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/tomer-y-avni"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2051668&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/133574325"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2052140"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2051668"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2051668"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2051668"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2051668"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2051668"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2051668"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2051668"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":2052125,"name":"Mark Settle","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/mark-settle\/","description":"Mark Settle is a seven-time CIO, three-time CIO 100 award winner and two-time book author.

Not only that, they\u2019re complex creatures with unique demands in terms of how they define job fulfillment. With demand for developers on the rise (the number of jobs in the field is expected to grow by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/ooh\/computer-and-information-technology\/software-developers.htm\">22%<\/a> over the next decade), companies are under pressure to do everything they can to attract and retain talent.<\/p>\n<p>First and foremost \u2014 above salary \u2014 employers must ensure that product teams are made up of developers who feel creatively stimulated and intellectually challenged. Without work that they feel passionate about, high-quality programmers won&#8217;t just become bored and potentially seek opportunities elsewhere, the standard of work will inevitably drop. In one survey, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.codingame.com\/work\/blog\/hr-news-trends\/10-hr-tech-trends-you-need-to-know-for-2018\/#:~:text=9.,important%20element%20to%20a%20job&amp;text=Great%20developers%20are%20always%20in,well%20expressed%20in%20job%20descriptions.\">68%<\/a> of developers said learning new things is the most important element of a job.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tThe worst thing for a developer to discover about a new job is that they\u2019re the most experienced person in the room and there\u2019s little room for their own growth.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Yet with only <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/1127222\/world-developers-satisfaction-job\/#:~:text=Job%20satisfaction%20of%20developers%202020&amp;text=The%20statistic%20shows%20the%20satisfaction,very%20satisfied%20with%20their%20job.\">32%<\/a> of developers feeling \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with their jobs, there\u2019s scope for you to position yourself as a company that prioritizes the development of its developers, and attract and retain top talent. So, how exactly can you ensure that your team stays stimulated and creatively engaged?<\/p>\n<h2>Allow time for personal projects<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/insights.stackoverflow.com\/survey\/2020#overview\">78%<\/a> of developers see coding as a hobby \u2014 and the best developers are the ones who have a true passion for software development, in and out of the workplace. This means they often have their own personal passions within the space, be it working with specific languages or platforms, or building certain kinds of applications.<\/p>\n<p>Back in their 2004 <a href=\"https:\/\/abc.xyz\/investor\/index.html\">IPO letter<\/a>, Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page wrote:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We encourage our employees, in addition to their regular projects, to spend 20% of their time working on what they think will most benefit Google. [This] empowers them to be more creative and innovative. Many of our significant advances have happened in this manner.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>At DevSquad, we\u2019ve adopted a similar approach. We have an \u201copen Friday\u201d policy where developers are able to learn and enhance their skills through personal projects. As long as the skills being gained contribute to work we are doing in other areas, the developers can devote that time to whatever they please, whether that\u2019s contributing to open-source projects or building a personal product. In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.stackoverflow.com\/survey\/2019\">65%<\/a> of professional developers on Stack Overflow contribute to open-source projects once a year or more, so it\u2019s likely that this is a keen interest within your development team too.<\/p>\n<p>Not only does this provide a creative outlet for developers, the company also gains from the continuously expanding skillset that comes as a result.<\/p>\n<h2>Provide opportunities to learn and teach<\/h2>\n<p>One of the most demotivating things for software developers is work that&#8217;s either too difficult or too easy. Too easy, and developers get bored; too hard, and morale can dip as a project seems insurmountable. Within our team, we remain hyperaware of the difficulty levels of the project or task at hand and the level of experience of the developers involved.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Not only is it the right way to treat your team, but when developers are more stimulated, the standard of their work goes up, along with productivity levels and general morale.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":133574325,"featured_media":2051645,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","carmot_uuid":"8b150ebc-ba87-3f32-85a4-bb764841c7a6"},"categories":[25515,14911,576596928,20429,17396],"tags":[5043,183,81,5812,61719,576686278,8452,61718,2301],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[576796357],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/GettyImages-138021770.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/2RXDrO3","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"featured":false,"subtitle":"","fundingRound":false,"seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","premiumContent":true,"premiumCutoffPercent":0.58,"tc_cb_mapping":[{"slug":"larry-page","cb_name":"Larry Page","cb_slug":"larry-page-person","cb_link":"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/larry-page"},{"slug":"google","cb_name":"Google","cb_slug":"google-organization","cb_link":"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/google"},{"slug":"sergey-brin","cb_name":"Sergey Brin","cb_slug":"sergey-brin-person","cb_link":"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/sergey-brin"}],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[2051570],"hideFeaturedImage":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2051576"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2051576"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2051576\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2051681,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2051576\/revisions\/2051681"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/phil-alves"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2051576&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/133574325"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2051645"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2051576"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2051576"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2051576"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2051576"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2051576"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2051576"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2051576"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":2051570,"name":"Phil Alves","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/phil-alves\/","description":"<a href=\"https:\/\/devsquad.com\/\">Devsquad<\/a> founder and CEO <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/philalves\">Phil Alves<\/a> is an expert entrepreneur with more than 15 years of experience in the tech industry leading product development teams for multiple clients.","slug":"phil-alves","links":{"twitter":"philalves01"},"position":"Contributor","cbDescription":"<a href=\"https:\/\/devsquad.com\/\">Devsquad<\/a> founder and CEO <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/philalves\">Phil Alves<\/a> is an expert entrepreneur with more than 15 years of experience in the tech industry leading product development teams for multiple clients.","cbAvatar":"","twitter":"philalves01"}],"author":[{"id":133574325,"name":"Walter Thompson","url":"https:\/\/anchor.fm\/thegoldencity","description":"Senior Editor Walter Thompson manages Extra Crunch and TechCrunch's guest post program.

href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/humanforest\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"humanforest\">HumanForest <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> has suspended its nascent &#8220;free&#8221; e-bike service in London this week, after experiencing &#8220;mechanical&#8221; issues and after a user had an accident on one of its bikes, TechCrunch has learned. The suspension has also seen the company make a number of layoffs with plans to re-launch next spring using a different e-bike.<\/p>\n<p>The service suspension comes only a few months after <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/humanforest\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"humanforest\">HumanForest <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> started the trial in North London &#8212; and just a couple of weeks after announcing a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/07\/humanforest-gets-2-3m-from-cabify-founders-and-others-to-grow-a-free-e-bike-sharing-service\/\">$2.3 million seed round of funding<\/a>\u00a0backed by the founders of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/01\/22\/uber-rival-cabify-has-raised-another-160m-at-a-1-4b-valuation\/\">Cabify<\/a> and others.<\/p>\n<p>We were tipped to the closure by an anonymous source who said they were employed by the startup. They told us the company&#8217;s e-bike had been found to have a defect and there had been an accident involving a user, after which the service was suspended. They also told us HumanForest fired a bunch of staff this week with little warning and minimal severance.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Asked about the source&#8217;s allegations, HumanForest confirmed it had suspended its service in London following a &#8220;minor accident&#8221; on Sunday, saying also that it had identified &#8220;problems of a similar nature&#8221; prior to the accident but had put down those down to &#8220;tampering or minor mechanical issues&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s its statement in full: &#8220;We were not aware that the bike was defective. There had been problems of a similar nature which were suspected to be tampering or minor mechanical issues. We undertook extra mechanical checks which we believed had resolved the issue and informed the supplier. We immediately suspended operations following the minor accident on Sunday. The supplier is now investigating whether there is a more serious problem with the e-bike.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In an earlier statement the startup also told us: &#8220;There was an accident last week. Fortunately, the customer was not hurt. We immediately withdrew all e-bikes from the street and we have informed the supplier who is investigating. Our customers&#8217; safety is our priority. We have, therefore, decided to re-launch with a new e-bike in Spring 2021&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>HumanForest declined to offer any details about the nature of the defect that caused it to suspend service but a spokeswoman confirmed all its e-bikes were withdrawn from London streets the same day as the accident, raising questions as to why it did not do so sooner &#8212; having, by its own admission, already identified &#8220;similar problems&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>The spokeswoman also confirmed HumanForest made a number of job cuts in the wake of the service suspension.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are very sorry that we had to let people go at this difficult time but, with operations suspended, we could only continue as a business with a significantly reduced team,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We tried very hard to find a way to keep people on board and we looked at the possibility of alternative contractual arrangements or employment but unfortunately, there are no guarantees of when we can re-launch.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Employees who had been with the company for less than three months were on their probation period which, as outlined in their contract, had one week\u2019s notice. We will be paying their salaries until the end of the month,&#8221; she said, reiterating that it&#8217;s a difficult time for the startup.<\/p>\n<p>The e-bikes HumanForest was using for the service appear to be manufactured by the Chinese firm <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/hongji\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"hongji\">Hongji <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> &#8212; but are supplied by a German startup, called <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/wundermobility\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"wundermobility\">Wunder Mobility, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> which offers <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/09\/05\/wunder-mobility\/\">both B2C and B2B mobility services<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>We contacted both companies to ask about the e-bike defect reported by HumanForest.<\/p>\n<p>At the time of writing only Wunder Mobility had responded &#8212; confirming it acts as &#8220;an intermediary&#8221; for HumanForest but not offering any details about the nature of the technical problem.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, it sent us this statement, attributed to its CCO Lukas Loers: &#8220;HumanForest stands for reliable quality and works continuously to improve its services. In order to offer its customers the best possible range of services in the sharing business, HumanForest will use the winter break to evaluate its findings from the pilot project in order to provide the best and most sustainable solution for its customers together with Wunder Mobility in the spring.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, we cannot provide any information about specific defects on the vehicles, as we have only acted as an intermediary. Only the manufacturer or the operator HumanForest can comment on this,&#8221; it added.<\/p>\n<p>In a further development this week, which points to the competitive and highly dynamic nature of the nascent micromobility market, another e-bike sharing startup, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/mtakso\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"mtakso\">Bolt <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> &#8212; which industry sources suggest uses the same model of e-bike as HumanForest (its e-bike is visually identical, just painted a more lurid shade of green) &#8212; closed its e-bike sharing service in Paris, a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/01\/bolt-launches-electric-bike-sharing-service-in-paris\/\">few months after launching<\/a> in the French capital.<\/p>\n<p>When we contacted Bolt to ask whether it had withdrawn any e-bikes because of technical issues it flat denied doing so &#8212; saying the Paris closure was a business decision, and was not related to problems with its e-bike hardware.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We understand some other companies have had issues with their providers. Bolt hasn\u2019t withdrawn any electric bikes from suppliers due to defects,&#8221; a spokesperson told us, going on to note it has &#8220;recently&#8221; launched in Barcelona and trailing &#8220;more announcements about future expansion soon&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>In follow-up emails the spokesperson further confirmed it hasn&#8217;t identified any defects with any e-bikes it&#8217;s tested, nor withdrawn any bikes from its supplier.<\/p>\n<p>Bolt&#8217;s U.K. country manager, Matt Barrie, had a little more to say in a response to chatter about the various micromobility market moves on Twitter &#8212; <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BarrieMatt\/status\/1309189108640747522\">tweeting<\/a> the claim that: &#8220;Hardware at Bolt is fine, all good, the issues that HumanForest have had are with their bespoke components.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The Paris-Prague move is a commercial decision to support our wider business in Prague. Paris a good market and we hope to be back soon,&#8221; he added.<\/p>\n<p>We asked HumanForest about Barrie&#8217;s claim that the technical issues with its hardware are related to &#8220;bespoke components&#8221; &#8212; but its spokeswoman declined to comment.<\/p>\n<p>HumanForest&#8217;s twist on the e-bike sharing model is the idea of offering free trips with in-app ads subsidizing the rides.

At the same time, it <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/14\/facebook-vs-apple\/\">complained that Apple had &#8220;dismissed&#8221; its requests<\/a> to waive the App Store&#8217;s customary 30% fee on in-app purchases.<\/p>\n<p>Today, Facebook is announcing a reversal on <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> part: Online event fees will be processed through Facebook Pay, without Apple collecting its 30% cut, meaning businesses will receive all of the earnings from their online events, minus taxes. This arrangement will last until December 31 and will not apply to gaming creators.<\/p>\n<p>The news comes after Facebook publicly pressured Apple to change its stance. It even submitted an iOS app update stating that &#8220;Apple takes 30% of this purchase&#8221; in the events payments flow. (Facebook said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-facebook-apple-exclusive\/exclusive-facebook-says-apple-rejected-its-attempt-to-tell-users-about-app-store-fees-idUSKBN25O042\">Apple rejected the update<\/a> for including information that&#8217;s &#8220;irrelevant&#8221; to users.)<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>And while the two companies appear to have come to an agreement, today&#8217;s statements from Facebook are still a bit barbed.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is a difficult time for small businesses and creators, which is why we are not collecting any fees from paid online events while communities remain closed for the pandemic,&#8221; said Facebook spokesperson Joe Osborne. &#8220;Apple has agreed to provide a brief, three-month respite after which struggling businesses will have to, yet again, pay Apple the full 30% App Store tax.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, in discussing the exception for gaming creators, Facebook Gaming Vice President Vivek Sharma said, &#8220;We unfortunately had to make this concession to get the temporary reprieve for other businesses.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>When asked about the change, Apple provided the following statement: &#8220;The App Store provides a great business opportunity for all developers, who use it to reach half a billion visitors each week across 175 countries. To ensure every developer can create and grow a successful business, Apple maintains a clear, consistent set of guidelines that apply equally to everyone.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>More specifically, Apple said it&#8217;s giving Facebook until the end of the year to implement in-app payments for these events and bring them into compliance with App Store rules.<\/p>\n<p>This also comes as Fortnite-maker Epic Games is waging a legal battle and publicity campaign against Apple&#8217;s App Store fees,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/28\/apple-terminates-epic-games\/\">with Fortnite removed from the iOS App Store<\/a>.

class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/bessemer-venture-partners\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"bessemer-venture-partners\">Bessemer Venture Partners&#8217; <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> annual<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bvp.com\/atlas\/the-cloud-100-benchmarks-report\/\"> Cloud 100 Benchmark report<\/a> was published recently and my colleague Alex Wilhelm <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/which-5-cloud-startup-categories-are-the-hottest\/\">looked at some broad trends in the report<\/a>, but digging into the data, I decided to concentrate on the Top 10 companies by valuation. I found that the top company has defied convention for a couple of reasons.<\/p>\n<p>Bessemer looks at private companies. Once they go public, they lose interest, and that&#8217;s why certain startups go in and out of this list each year. As an example, <a href=\"http:\/\/dropbox.com\">Dropbox<\/a> was the most highly valued company by far with a valuation in the $10 billion range\u00a0for 2016 and 2017, the earliest data in the report. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/03\/23\/dropbox-pops-more-than-40-in-its-public-debut-as-a-publicly-traded-company\/\">It went public in 2018<\/a> and therefore disappeared.<\/p>\n<p>While that $10 billion benchmark remains a fairly good measure of a solidly valued cloud company, one company in particular blew away the field in terms of valuation, an outlier so huge, its value dwarfs even the mighty <a href=\"http:\/\/snowflake.com\">Snowflake<\/a>, which was valued<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/09\/after-479m-round-on-12-4b-valuation-snowflake-ceo-says-ipo-is-next-step\/\"> at over $12 billion<\/a> before<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/24\/a-quick-peek-at-snowflakes-ipo-filing\/?tpcc=ECTW2020\"> it went public<\/a> earlier this month.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>That company is <a href=\"http:\/\/stripe.com\">Stripe<\/a>, which has an other-worldly valuation of $36 billion. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/stripe\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"stripe\">Stripe <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> began its ascent to the top of the charts in 2016 and 2017 when it sat behind Dropbox with a $6 billion valuation in 2016 and around $8 billion in 2017. By the time <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/dropbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"dropbox\">Dropbox <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> left the chart in 2018, Stripe would have likely blown past it when its valuation soared to $20 billion. It zipped up to around $23 billion last year before taking another enormous leap to $36 billion this year.<\/p>\n<p>Stripe remains an outlier not only for its enormous valuation, but also the fact that it hasn&#8217;t gone public yet. As TechCrunch&#8217;s Ingrid Lunden <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/23\/stripe-adds-card-issuing-localized-card-networks-and-expanded-approvals-tool\/\">pointed out in an article earlier this year<\/a>, the company has remained quiet about its intentions, although there has been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/davidjeans\/2020\/09\/23\/stripe-partners-with-salesforce-in-enterprise-push-as-potential-ipo-looms\/#24bf85a26488\">some speculation lately<\/a> that an IPO could be coming.<\/p>\n<p>What Stripe has done to earn that crazy valuation is to be the cloud payment API of choice for some of the largest companies on the internet. Consider that Stripe&#8217;s customers include Amazon, Salesforce, Google and Shopify and it&#8217;s not hard to see why this company is valued as highly as it is.<\/p>\n<p>Stripe came up with the idea of making it simple to incorporate a payments mechanism into your app or website, something that&#8217;s extremely time-consuming to do. Instead of building their own, developers tapped into Stripe&#8217;s ready-made variety and Stripe gets a little money every time someone bangs on the payment gateway.<\/p>\n<p>When you&#8217;re talking about some of the biggest companies in the world being involved, and many others large and small, all of those payments running through Stripe&#8217;s systems add up to a hefty amount of revenue, and that revenue has led to this amazing valuation.<\/p>\n<p>One other company you might want to pay attention to here is <a href=\"http:\/\/uipath.com\">UIPath<\/a>, the robotic process automation company, which was sitting just behind Snowflake <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/13\/uipath-reels-in-another-225m-as-valuation-soars-to-10-2b\/\">with a valuation of over $10 billion<\/a>. While it&#8217;s unclear if RPA, the technology that helps automate legacy workflows, will have the lasting power of a payments API, it certainly has come on strong the last couple of years.<\/p>\n<p>Most of the companies in this report appear for a couple of years as they become unicorns, watch their values soar and eventually go public.
