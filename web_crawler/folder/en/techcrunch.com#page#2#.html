Watch Series 6 review"},"content":{"rendered":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">When it comes<\/span> to smartwatches, it\u2019s Apple against the world. It\u2019s not that there aren\u2019t plenty of other products to choose from \u2014 it\u2019s more that the company has just utterly dominated the space to such a point that any other device is relegated to the realm of \u201c<a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Watch alternatives.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The company has been successful in the space for the usual Apple reasons: premium hardware with deeply integrated software, third-party support, a large cross-device ecosystem play and, of, course, simplicity. Taken as a whole, the Watch just works, right out of the box.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Five years after launch, the line is fairly mature. As such, it\u2019s no surprise, really, that recent updates have largely amounted to refinements. As with most updates, the watch has gotten a processor boost up to the A14 processor, which the company claims is 20% faster than the last version.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>Perhaps the biggest hardware upgrade, however, is the addition of a blood oxygen sensor, an important piece in the company\u2019s quest to offer as complete an image of wearer health as is possible from the wrist.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Dkvjc9vzsO\"><p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/a-closer-look-at-the-new-apple-watches\/\">A closer look at the new Apple Watches<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;A closer look at the new Apple Watches&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/a-closer-look-at-the-new-apple-watches\/embed\/#?secret=Dkvjc9vzsO\" data-secret=\"Dkvjc9vzsO\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">I wrote<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/a-closer-look-at-the-new-apple-watches\/\"> a pretty lengthy piece<\/a> about the watch last week after wearing it for a few days. As I mentioned at the time, it was an odd kind of writeup, somewhere between hands-on and review. A week or so later, however, I\u2019m more comfortable calling this a review \u2014 even if not too many of my initial impressions have changed much in the past several days. After all, a mature product largely means most of the foundations remain unchanged.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Series 6 certainly looks the part. The Watch is tough to distinguish from other recent models \u2014 and for that matter, the new and significantly cheaper SE. The biggest visual change is the addition of new colors. In addition to the standard Gray and Gold, Apple\u2019s added new Blue and (Product)Red cases. The latter seems to be the more ostentatious of the pair. The company sent me a blue model, and honestly, it\u2019s a lot more subtle than I expected. It\u2019s more of a deep blue hue, really, that reads more as black a lot of the time.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s tough to imagine the product undergoing any sort of radical rethink of the device\u2019s design language at this point. We may see slight tweaks, including larger screen area going forward, but on the whole, Apple is very much committed to a form factor that has worked very well for it. I will probably always prefer Samsung\u2019s spinning bezel as a quick way to interface with the operating system, but the crown does the job well and scrolling through menus even feels a bit zippier this time, perhaps owing to that faster silicon.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"LWNvL7GOH3\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/you-can-now-return-apples-solo-loop-for-a-new-size-without-sending-back-the-watch\/\">You can now return Apple\u2019s Solo Loop for a new size, without sending back the Watch<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;You can now return Apple\u2019s Solo Loop for a new size, without sending back the Watch&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/you-can-now-return-apples-solo-loop-for-a-new-size-without-sending-back-the-watch\/embed\/#?secret=LWNvL7GOH3\" data-secret=\"LWNvL7GOH3\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">The new Solo Loop bands hit a bit of a hiccup out of the gate. I\u2019ve <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/you-can-now-return-apples-solo-loop-for-a-new-size-without-sending-back-the-watch\/\">detailed that a bit more here<\/a>, but I suspect that much of the problem came down to the difficulty of selling a specifically sized product during a strange period in history where in-person try-ons aren\u2019t really an option. In other words, just really bad timing on that front.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Personally, I quite like the braided model. I\u2019ve been using it as my day to day band. It\u2019s nice and blends in a lot better than the silicone model (I\u2019ve frankly never been much of a fan of Apple\u2019s silicone bands). But I do need to mention that Apple sent me a couple different sizes, which made it much easier to find the right fit. I recognize that. Especially when the braided Solo Loop costs a fairly exorbitant $99. The silicone version is significantly cheaper at $49, but either way, you\u2019re not getting off cheap there. So you definitely want to make sure you get the right fit.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052164\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052164\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2052164\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg 4000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052164\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This is doubly important given the fact that the Series 6\u2019s biggest new feature \u2014 blood oxygen monitoring \u2014 is highly dependent on you getting a good fit. The sensor utilizes a series of LEDs on the bottom of the watch to shine infrared and red light through the wearer\u2019s skin and into their blood vessels. The color of light that reflects back gives the watch a picture of the oxygen levels in the blood. The whole thing takes about 15 seconds, but only works if your fit is right. Even with the right Solo Loop on, I found myself having to retake it a few times when I first started wearing the watch.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Beyond the on-demand measurements, the watch will also take readings throughout the day and night, mapping these trends over time and incorporating them into sleep readings. The overall readings will give you a good picture of your numbers over time. Honestly though, I get the sense that this is really just the tip of the iceberg of future functionality.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For now, there\u2019s really no specific guidance \u2014 or context \u2014 given as far as what the numbers mean. Mine are generally between 90-100%. The Mayo Clinic tells me that\u2019s good, but obviously there are a lot of different factors and variations that can\u2019t properly be contextualized in a single paragraph &#8212; or on a watch. And Apple certainly doesn\u2019t want to be accused of attempting to diagnose a condition or offer specific medical guidance. That\u2019s going to be an increasingly difficult line for the company to walk as it gets more serious about these sorts of health tools.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If I had to venture a guess, I would say that the combination of sleep tracking in watchOS 7 and the on-board oximeter opens the door pretty nicely for something like sleep apnea tracking (again, more focused on alerts of irregularity versus diagnosis). We\u2019ve seen a small handful of companies like Withings tackle this, so it seems like a no-brainer for Apple, pending all of the regulatory requirements, et al. There are all sorts of other conditions that blood oxygen levels could potentially alert the wearer to, if not actually diagnose.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sleep was probably the biggest addition with the latest version of watchOS. This was probably the biggest blind spot for the line, compared to the competition. At the moment, the sleep tracking is, admittedly, still pretty basic. Like much of the rest of the on-board tracking, it\u2019s mostly compared with changes over time. The metrics include time in bed versus time asleep, as well as incorporating heart rate figures from the sensor\u2019s regular check-ins. More specific breakdowns, including deep versus light versus REM sleep haven\u2019t arrived yet, but will no doubt be coming sooner than later.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052166\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052166\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2052166 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg 4000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052166\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The door is also wide open for Apple to really get mindfulness right. The company has incorporated a mindfulness reminder for a while now, but it\u2019s easy to imagine how the addition of various sensors like heart rate could really improve the picture and find the company going all-in on meditation, et al. The company could partner with a big meditation name \u2014 or, more likely, disrupt things with its own offering. The forthcoming Fitness+ offering could play an important role in the growth of that category, as well.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The other issue that sleep brings to the front is battery life. I was banking on the company making big strides in the battery department \u2014 after all, a big part of sleep tracking is ensuring that you\u2019ve got enough charge to get through the night. Apple really only briefly touched on battery \u2014 though <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ifixit.com\/Teardown\/Apple+Watch+Series+6+Teardown\/136694?utm_content=buffer408ad&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\">a recent teardown<\/a> has revealed some smallish improvements on battery capacity (perhaps owing, in part, to space freed up by the dropping of Force Touch).<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The company has also made some improvements to energy efficiency, courtesy of the new silicon. Official literature puts it at a \u201cfull-day\u201d of<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>battery life, up to 18 hours. I found I was able to get through a full day with juice to spare. That\u2019s good, but the company\u2019s still got some ground to make up on that front, compared to, say, the Fitbit Sense, which is capable of getting nearly a week on a charge. I think at this point, it\u2019s fair to hold wearables to higher standards of battery life than, say, handsets. More than once, I\u2019ve found myself intermittently charging the device \u2014 20 minutes here and 20 minutes there \u2014 in order to have enough juice left by bedtime.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"GxSVdjFou2\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/29\/apple-began-work-on-the-watchs-hand-washing-feature-years-before-covid-19\/\">Apple began work on the Watch\u2019s handwashing feature years before COVID-19<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Apple began work on the Watch\u2019s handwashing feature years before COVID-19&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/29\/apple-began-work-on-the-watchs-hand-washing-feature-years-before-covid-19\/embed\/#?secret=GxSVdjFou2\" data-secret=\"GxSVdjFou2\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you can spare more time than that, you should be able to get up to 80% in an hour or 100% in an hour and a half, courtesy of faster wireless charging. All told, the company has been able to shave significant time off of charging \u2014 a definite plus now that you\u2019re not just leaving it overnight to charge. The latest version of watchOS will also handily let you know before if you don\u2019t have enough charge to make it through a full night.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Other updates include the addition of the always-on Altimeter, which, along with the brighter screen doesn\u2019t appear to have had a major impact on the battery. I\u2019ll be honest, being stuck in the city for these last several months hasn\u2019t given me much reason to need real-time elevation stats. Though the feature is a nice step toward taking the Watch a bit more seriously as an outdoor accessory in a realm that has largely been dominated by the likes of Garmin.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052167\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052167\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2052167\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg 4000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052167\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Of course, the company now has three watches on the market \u2014 including the Series 3, which just keeps on ticking, and the lower-cost SE. The latter retains the design of the Series 6, but drops a number of the key sensors, which honestly should be perfectly sufficient for many users \u2014 and $170 cheaper than the 6\u2019s $399 starting price ($499 with cellular).<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Taken as a whole, the Series 6 isn\u2019t a huge leap forward over the Series 5 \u2014 and not really worth the upgrade for those who already own that recent vintage. But there are nice improvements throughout, augmented by good upgrades to watchOS that make the best-selling smartwatch that much better, while clearly laying the groundwork for Apple Watches of the future.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/Apple-Hardware-Event-2020\/\"><img src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/apple-hardware-event-2020.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When it comes to smartwatches, it\u2019s Apple against the world.

company he runs with managing partner Mary Chan, and would be part of a consortium of investors, according to one unnamed source who requested anonymity because the deal had yet to be finalized. The deal could close as early as mid-October.<\/p>\n<p>TuSimple as well as Girsky declined to comment.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>It&#8217;s no secret that TuSimple has been seeking new capital.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/26\/tusimple-seeking-250-million-in-new-funding-to-scale-self-driving-trucks\/\">TechCrunch reported in June that TuSimple was in search of $250 million<\/a> in fresh capital from investors. The company hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to help it raise funds, according to multiple sources familiar with the effort. Since then, TuSimple, which already has backing from Sina, UPS and Tier 1 supplier Mando Corp., has announced a partnership with Navistar and most recently, the Traton Group.<\/p>\n<p>Girsky has most recently captured headlines because of Nikola, where he is now the executive chairman. Girsky took over as chairman in September after Nikola&#8217;s founder, Trevor Milton, stepped down following fallout from <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/nikola-disputes-fraud-claims-in-carefully-worded-rebuttal\/\">a scathing report<\/a> by short-seller firm Hindenburg Research that accused the company of fraud. VectoIQ Acquisition Corp., the SPAC that Girsky formed in 2018, announced a merger with Nikola in March, and Girsky oversaw its public listing this past June. He shepherded an introduction between Nikola and his former boss, GM CEO and chairwoman Mary Barra, according to one source familiar with the deal. By mid-September the automaker had announced a partnership valued at $2 billion with Nikola.<\/p>\n<p>Girsky may be Nikola&#8217;s new chairman and certainly has executive experience, but his focus in recent years has been as an advisor, investor and matchmaker. Girsky has long had an interest in mobility-related companies. His firm VectoIQ LLC specializes in advising companies and connecting large companies with startups working on autonomous vehicle technology, electrification, connected, cybersecurity and mobility-as-a-service.<\/p>\n<p>VectoIQ invested in lidar startup Luminar, which recently announced it was going public through a SPAC merger with Gores Metropoulos Inc., at a post-deal market valuation of $3.4 billion. Girsky also sat on the board of autonomous vehicle startup Drive.ai, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/06\/25\/self-driving-startup-drive-ai-is-closing-down\/\">which was acquired by Apple<\/a> as the company prepared to shut down.<\/p>\n<p>Girsky&#8217;s investment in TuSimple is separate from his interests in Nikola, which has yet to begin production of its Class 8 trucks, according to sources.<\/p>\n<p>TuSimple, which launched in 2015 and has operations in China, San Diego and Tucson, Arizona, is focused on the autonomous vehicle technology stack that will allow Class 8 trucks to operate without a human driver. TuSimple operates a fleet of 40 self-driving trucks in the U.S. that are used for testing and to carry freight between Arizona and Texas.<\/p>\n<p>TuSimple announced in July plans to develop and begin producing autonomous semi trucks by 2024 in partnership with Navistar. In September, Volkswagen AG&#8217;s heavy-truck business Traton Group said it took a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/23\/vws-traton-group-strikes-a-deal-with-tusimple-to-develop-autonomous-trucks\/\">minority stake in TuSimple<\/a> as part of an agreement between the two companies to develop self-driving trucks. Neither company disclosed the financial terms of the partnership or the percentage of the minority stake. Traton did make a direct capital investment into TuSimple, according to one unnamed source familiar with the deal. It&#8217;s unclear if it also included in-kind contributions.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Steve Girsky, the former GM vice chairman, consultant and investor whose special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merged with hydrogen electric startup Nikola this summer, is in talks to back self-driving trucks startup TuSimple, according to four people familiar with the deal.

href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1825205\/000182520520000001\/xslFormDX01\/primary_doc.xml\">According to an SEC filing<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/alexisohanian\">Alexis Ohanian<\/a>, the co-founder of Reddit and early-stage VC firm Initialized Capital, is raising a new fund, named 776, with a target of $150 million. The filing comes <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/26\/alexis-ohanian-reddit-co-founder-is-leaving-initialized-capital\/\">three months<\/a> after the entrepreneur left Initialized Capital and a month after The Information <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theinformation.com\/articles\/reddit-co-founder-alexis-ohanian-plots-new-early-stage-vc-fund\">first reported<\/a> on his plans. Ohanian declined to comment on details regarding the fund due to general solicitation restraints.<\/p>\n<p>Along the filing, the fund launched an intentionally cryptic new website:<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sevensevensix.com\/\"> sevensevensix.com<\/a>. It appears that the name of the fund is a reference to when the first Olympics were held, in 776 B.C.E.<\/p>\n<p>The website reads: &#8220;The first Olympics brought the best athletes from all over the known world to determine who was the greatest. The first competition was a 192m footrace; it was won by a cook from a nearby village. We\u2019re going back to that very first starting line.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>If I had to guess, I&#8217;d say Ohanian&#8217;s investing in pre-seed and seed startups.

But as founders flurry to a sector recently rejuvenated with capital, the influx of interest has not fostered any breakout solutions. As a result, edtech investors must hone their skills at sorting the innovators from the opportunists amid the rush.<\/p>\n<p>Lucky for us, investors shared notes during TechCrunch Disrupt and offline regarding how they are separating the gold from the sand, giving us a peek into their due diligence process (and inboxes).<\/p>\n<h2>Putting profitability over growth<\/h2>\n<p>The pandemic has broadly forced founders to get more conservative and prioritize profitability over the usual &#8220;growth at all costs&#8221; startup mentality. Growth still matters, but within edtech, the boom comes with a big focus on profitability, efficacy, outcomes and societal impact.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The goal of all of education is personalized learning, when every student receives exactly the instruction in the way that they need it at the time that they need it. And that&#8217;s really, really difficult to do if you&#8217;re trying to have one person teach 180 students,&#8221; said <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/mercedes-bent\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"mercedes-bent\">Mercedes Bent <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> of Lightspeed Venture Partners. &#8220;And so I&#8217;ve been excited to see more solutions that are focused on creating smaller class sizes that are also focused on allowing students to connect with people outside of their homes as well.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>During Disrupt, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/reach-capital\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"reach-capital\">Reach Capital&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/jennifer-carolan\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"jennifer-carolan\">Jennifer Carolan <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> brought up a recent Netflix documentary, &#8220;The Social Dilemma,&#8221; which illustrates the impact screen time can have on society.

class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/bessemer-venture-partners\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"bessemer-venture-partners\">Bessemer Venture Partners&#8217; <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> annual<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bvp.com\/atlas\/the-cloud-100-benchmarks-report\/\"> Cloud 100 Benchmark report<\/a> was published recently and my colleague Alex Wilhelm <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/which-5-cloud-startup-categories-are-the-hottest\/\">looked at some broad trends in the report<\/a>, but digging into the data, I decided to concentrate on the Top 10 companies by valuation. I found that the top company has defied convention for a couple of reasons.<\/p>\n<p>Bessemer looks at private companies. Once they go public, they lose interest, and that&#8217;s why certain startups go in and out of this list each year. As an example, <a href=\"http:\/\/dropbox.com\">Dropbox<\/a> was the most highly valued company by far with a valuation in the $10 billion range\u00a0for 2016 and 2017, the earliest data in the report. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/03\/23\/dropbox-pops-more-than-40-in-its-public-debut-as-a-publicly-traded-company\/\">It went public in 2018<\/a> and therefore disappeared.<\/p>\n<p>While that $10 billion benchmark remains a fairly good measure of a solidly valued cloud company, one company in particular blew away the field in terms of valuation, an outlier so huge, its value dwarfs even the mighty <a href=\"http:\/\/snowflake.com\">Snowflake<\/a>, which was valued<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/09\/after-479m-round-on-12-4b-valuation-snowflake-ceo-says-ipo-is-next-step\/\"> at over $12 billion<\/a> before<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/24\/a-quick-peek-at-snowflakes-ipo-filing\/?tpcc=ECTW2020\"> it went public<\/a> earlier this month.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>That company is <a href=\"http:\/\/stripe.com\">Stripe<\/a>, which has an other-worldly valuation of $36 billion. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/stripe\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"stripe\">Stripe <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> began its ascent to the top of the charts in 2016 and 2017 when it sat behind Dropbox with a $6 billion valuation in 2016 and around $8 billion in 2017. By the time <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/dropbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"dropbox\">Dropbox <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> left the chart in 2018, Stripe would have likely blown past it when its valuation soared to $20 billion. It zipped up to around $23 billion last year before taking another enormous leap to $36 billion this year.<\/p>\n<p>Stripe remains an outlier not only for its enormous valuation, but also the fact that it hasn&#8217;t gone public yet. As TechCrunch&#8217;s Ingrid Lunden <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/23\/stripe-adds-card-issuing-localized-card-networks-and-expanded-approvals-tool\/\">pointed out in an article earlier this year<\/a>, the company has remained quiet about its intentions, although there has been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/davidjeans\/2020\/09\/23\/stripe-partners-with-salesforce-in-enterprise-push-as-potential-ipo-looms\/#24bf85a26488\">some speculation lately<\/a> that an IPO could be coming.<\/p>\n<p>What Stripe has done to earn that crazy valuation is to be the cloud payment API of choice for some of the largest companies on the internet. Consider that Stripe&#8217;s customers include Amazon, Salesforce, Google and Shopify and it&#8217;s not hard to see why this company is valued as highly as it is.<\/p>\n<p>Stripe came up with the idea of making it simple to incorporate a payments mechanism into your app or website, something that&#8217;s extremely time-consuming to do. Instead of building their own, developers tapped into Stripe&#8217;s ready-made variety and Stripe gets a little money every time someone bangs on the payment gateway.<\/p>\n<p>When you&#8217;re talking about some of the biggest companies in the world being involved, and many others large and small, all of those payments running through Stripe&#8217;s systems add up to a hefty amount of revenue, and that revenue has led to this amazing valuation.<\/p>\n<p>One other company you might want to pay attention to here is <a href=\"http:\/\/uipath.com\">UIPath<\/a>, the robotic process automation company, which was sitting just behind Snowflake <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/13\/uipath-reels-in-another-225m-as-valuation-soars-to-10-2b\/\">with a valuation of over $10 billion<\/a>. While it&#8217;s unclear if RPA, the technology that helps automate legacy workflows, will have the lasting power of a payments API, it certainly has come on strong the last couple of years.<\/p>\n<p>Most of the companies in this report appear for a couple of years as they become unicorns, watch their values soar and eventually go public. Stripe up to this point has chosen not to do that, making it a highly unusual company.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"aCN7CHZw52\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/which-5-cloud-startup-categories-are-the-hottest\/\">Which 5 cloud startup categories are the hottest?<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Which 5 cloud startup categories are the hottest?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/which-5-cloud-startup-categories-are-the-hottest\/embed\/#?secret=aCN7CHZw52\" data-secret=\"aCN7CHZw52\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This year&#8217;s Bessemer Venture Partners&#8217; annual Cloud 100 Benchmark report was published recently and my colleague Alex Wilhelm looked at some broad trends in the report, but digging into the data, I decided to concentrate on the Top 10 companies by valuation.

That has hit European countries especially hard, with countries in the region scrambling to provide public assistance to individuals and businesses who have been put out of work through furlough schemes and other efforts. In that context, collecting tax revenues and ensuring fair competition take on particularly acute profiles.<\/p>\n<p>The original ruling that struck down the State Aid case was seen as a major blow to Europe&#8217;s efforts to recoup taxes from large multinationals that have built highly profitable operations in the region under big tax breaks.<\/p>\n<p>In that ruling, the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/eucourtpress\/status\/1283326636348379137\">court determined<\/a>\u00a0that \u201cthe Commission did not succeed in showing to the requisite legal standard that there was an advantage for the purposes of Article 107(1) TFEU [Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union].\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Apple&#8217;s basic contention has always been that the offices in Europe are not where the profits are really made and this is why it shouldn&#8217;t have to pay taxes on those earnings there.<\/p>\n<p>Apple had started to amass the funding needed to pay the fine in an escrow account after the original ruling in 2016 but hadn&#8217;t commenced in doing so.<\/p>\n<p>We have contacted Apple for its response and will update this post as we learn more.<\/p>\n<p><em>More to come. Refresh for updates. Memo below.<\/em><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe Commission has decided to appeal before the European Court of Justice the General Court&#8217;s judgment of July 2020 on the Apple State aid case in Ireland, which annulled the Commission&#8217;s decision of August 2016 finding that Ireland granted illegal State aid to Apple through selective tax breaks.<\/p>\n<p>The General Court judgment raises important legal issues that are of relevance to the Commission in its application of State aid rules to tax planning cases. The Commission also respectfully considers that in its judgment the General Court has made a number of errors of law. For this reason, the Commission is bringing this matter before the <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/european-court-of-justice\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"european-court-of-justice\">European Court of Justice <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Making sure that all companies, big and small, pay their fair share of tax remains a top priority for the Commission. The General Court has repeatedly confirmed the principle that, while Member States have competence in determining their taxation laws taxation, they must do so in respect of EU law, including State aid rules. If Member States give certain multinational companies tax advantages not available to their rivals, this harms fair competition in the European Union in breach of State aid rules.<\/p>\n<p>We have to continue to use all tools at our disposal to ensure companies pay their fair share of tax. Otherwise, the public purse and citizens are deprived of funds for much needed investments \u2013 the need for which is even more acute now to support Europe&#8217;s economic recovery. We need to continue our efforts to put in place the right legislation to address loopholes and ensure transparency. So, there&#8217;s more work ahead \u2013 including to make sure that all businesses, including digital ones, pay their fair share of tax where it is rightfully due.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s not over until it&#8217;s over for Apple and its ongoing tax headache in Europe.

The ban commences on October 5.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Within the undertaking, Alexander Nix did not dispute that he caused or permitted SCL Elections Ltd or associated companies to market themselves as offering potentially unethical services to prospective clients; demonstrating a lack of commercial probity,&#8221; the U.K. insolvency service wrote in a press release.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Nix was <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/03\/20\/cambridge-analytica-ceo-alexander-nix-has-reportedly-been-suspended\/\">suspended as CEO of Cambridge Analytica<\/a> at the peak of the Facebook data scandal after footage emerged of him, filmed by undercover reporters, boasting of spreading disinformation and entrapping politicians to meet clients\u2019 needs.<\/p>\n<p>Cambridge Analytica was a subsidiary of the SCL Group, which included the division SCL Elections, while Nix was one of the key people in the group &#8212; being a director for SCL Group Ltd, SCL Social Ltd, SCL Analytics Ltd, SCL Commercial Ltd, SCL Elections and Cambridge Analytica (UK) Ltd. All six companies entered into administration in May 2018, going into compulsory liquidation in April 2019.<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;potentially unethical&#8221; activities that Nix does not dispute the companies offered, per the undertaking, are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>bribery stings and honey trap stings designed to uncover corruption<\/li>\n<li>voter disengagement campaigns<\/li>\n<li>the obtaining of information to discredit political opponents<\/li>\n<li>the anonymous spreading of information<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/24\/ftc-also-sues-cambridge-analytica-settles-with-former-ceo-and-app-developer\/\">Last year<\/a> the FTC also settled with Nix over the data misuse scandal &#8212; with the former Cambridge Analytica boss agreeing to an administrative order restricting how he conducts business in the future. The order also required the deletion\/destruction of any personal information collected via the business.<\/p>\n<p>Back in 2018 Nix was also <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/06\/06\/cambridge-analyticas-nix-said-it-licensed-millions-of-data-points-from-axciom-experian-infogroup-to-target-us-voters\/\">grilled by the U.K. parliament&#8217;s DCMS committee<\/a> &#8212; and in a second hearing he claimed Cambridge Analytica had licensed &#8220;millions of data points on American individuals from very large reputable data aggregators and data vendors such as Acxiom, Experian, Infogroup&#8221;, arguing the Facebook data had not been its &#8220;foundational data-set&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s fair to say there are still many unanswered questions attached to the data misuse scandal. Last month, for example, the U.K.&#8217;s data watchdog &#8212; which <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/03\/24\/cambridge-analytica-raided-by-uk-data-watchdog\/\">raided Cambridge Analytica&#8217;s U.K. offices in 2018<\/a>, seizing evidence, before going on to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/10\/25\/uk-watchdog-hands-facebook-500k-fine\/\">fine<\/a> and then <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/30\/facebook-agrees-to-pay-uk-data-watchdogs-cambridge-analytica-fine-but-settles-without-admitting-liability\/\">settle with Facebook<\/a> (which did not admit any liability) over the scandal &#8212; said it would no longer be publishing a final report on its data analytics investigation.<\/p>\n<p>Asked about the fate of the final report on Cambridge Analytica, an ICO spokesperson told us: \u201cAs part of the conclusion to our data analytics investigation we will be writing to the DCMS select committee to answer the outstanding questions from April 2019. We have committed to updating the select committee on our final findings but this will not be in the form of a further report.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not clear whether the DCMS committee &#8212; which has reformed with a different chair versus the one who in 2018 led the charge to dig into the Cambridge Analytica scandal as part of an enquiry into the impact of online disinformation &#8212; will publish the ICO&#8217;s written answers. Last year its <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/17\/uk-parliament-calls-for-antitrust-data-abuse-probe-of-facebook\/\">final report<\/a> called for Facebook&#8217;s business to be investigated over data protection and competition concerns.<\/p>\n<p>You can read a<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/11\/06\/cambridge-analytica-ceo-talks-to-techcrunch-about-trump-hilary-and-the-future\/\"> TechCrunch interview with Nix here<\/a>, from 2017 before the Facebook data scandal broke, in which he discusses how his company helped the Trump campaign.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The former CEO of Cambridge Analytica, the disgraced data company that worked for the 2016 Trump campaign and shut down in 2018 over a voter manipulation scandal involving masses of Facebook data &#8212; has been banned from running limited companies for seven years.

Asia. Co-founder and chief executive officer Mario Suntanu told TechCrunch that the capital will be used to expand into more major cities and on developing its tech platform, including data analytics.<\/p>\n<p>Other participants in the round included returning investors <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/intudo-ventures\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"intudo-ventures\">Intudo Ventures <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and Sovereign\u2019s Capital, and new backers Vectr Ventures, AppWorks, Quest Ventures, Coca-Cola Amatil X and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/palm-drivecapital\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"palm-drivecapital\">Palm Drive Capital <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>. The Series B brings Yummy Corporation&#8217;s total raised so far to $19.5 million.<\/p>\n<p>Launched in June 2019, Yummy Corporation\u2019s network of cloud kitchens, called Yummykitchen, now includes more than 70 HACCP-certified facilities in Jakarta, Bandung and Medan. It partners with more than 50 food and beverage (F&amp;B) companies, including major brands like Ismaya Group and Sour Sally Group.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>During COVID-19 movement restrictions, Suntanu said Yummykitchen&#8217;s business showed &#8220;healthy growth&#8221; as people, confined mostly to their homes, ordered food for delivery. Funding will be used to get more partners, especially brands that want to digitize their operations and expand deliveries to cope with the continuing impact of COVID-19.<\/p>\n<p>The number of cloud kitchens in Southeast Asia<a href=\"https:\/\/www.jumpstartmag.com\/indonesian-cloud-kitchen-market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> has grown quickly over the past year<\/a>, driven by demand for food deliveries that began increasing even before the pandemic. But for F&amp;B brands that rely on deliveries for a good part of their revenue, running their own kitchens and staff can be cost-prohibitive. Sharing cloud kitchens with other businesses can help increase their margins.<\/p>\n<p>Other cloud kitchen startups serving Indonesia include Hangry and Everplate, but these companies and Yummy Corporation are all up against two major players: &#8220;super apps&#8221; <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/grabtaxi\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"grabtaxi\">Grab <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and Gojek, which both <a href=\"https:\/\/asia.nikkei.com\/Business\/Food-Beverage\/Southeast-Asia-s-cloud-kitchens-swell-powered-by-Grab-and-Gojek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">operate large networks of cloud kitchens <\/a>that have the advantage of being integrated with their on-demand delivery services.<\/p>\n<p>Suntanu said Yummy&#8217;s main edge compared to other cloud kitchens is that it also offers fully managed location and kitchen operation services, in addition to kitchen facilities. This means Yummy&#8217;s partners, including restaurants and F&amp;B brands, don\u2019t need to hire their own teams. Instead, food preparation and delivery is handled by Yummy&#8217;s workers. The company also provides its clients with a data analytics platform to help them with targeted ad campaigns and making their listings more visible on food delivery apps.<\/p>\n<p>In a statement, Harris Yang, Southeast Asia associate at SoftBank Ventures Asia, said the firm invested in Yummy because &#8220;given the company\u2019s strong expertise in the F&amp;B industry and unique value proposition to brands, we believe that Yummy will continue to be the leader in this space.

Anand Giridharadas on tech&#8217;s billionaires: &#8220;Are they even on the same team as us?&#8221;"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, America&#8217;s roughly 640 billionaires have seen their fortunes soar by $845 billion in combined assets or 29% collectively, widening the already yawning gap between the very richest and the rest of the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>Many of those billions were made by tech founders, including <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/mark-zuckerberg\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"mark-zuckerberg\">Mark Zuckerberg, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/jeff-bezos\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"jeff-bezos\">Jeff Bezos, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and Elon Musk, whose companies have soared in value and, in tandem, their net worth. In fact, so much has been made so fast and by so few relatively, that it&#8217;s easy to wonder if greater equality is now forever out of reach.<\/p>\n<p>To talk about that question, we reached out earlier this week to Ananad Giridharadas, a former New York Times correspondent whose 2018 book, \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.penguinrandomhouse.com\/books\/539747\/winners-take-all-by-anand-giridharadas\/\">Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World<\/a>,&#8221; became a best-seller.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Giridharadas&#8217;s message at the time was largely that the generosity of the global elite is somewhat laughable &#8212; that many of the same players who say they want to help society are creating its most intractable problems. Think, for example, of Bezos, whose company paid<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/02\/04\/amazon-had-to-pay-federal-income-taxes-for-the-first-time-since-2016.html\"> zero in federal tax in 2017 and 2018<\/a> and who is now on the cusp of opening a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/jeff-bezos-opens-free-preschools-bezos-academy-2020-9\">tuition-free<\/a> preschool for underserved children called the Bezos Academy.<\/p>\n<p>Given the aggressive escalation over the last six months of the same trends Giridharadas has tracked for years, we wondered how he views the current situation. Our chat has been edited for length and clarity.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: You have a <a href=\"https:\/\/the.ink\/\">weekly newsletter<\/a> where you make the point that Jeff Bezos could give every one of Amazon&#8217;s 876,000 employees a &#8216;pandemic&#8217; bonus of $105,000, and he would still have as much money as he did in March.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>AG: There&#8217;s this way in which these crises are not merely things that the rich and powerful survive. They&#8217;re things that they leverage and exploit, and it starts to raise the question of: are they even on the same team as us? Because when you have discussions about stimulus relief, around what kind of policy responses you could have to something like the 2008 financial crisis or the pandemic, there&#8217;s initially some discussion and clamor for universal basic income, or substantial monthly checks for people, or even the French approach of nationalizing people salaries. . .and those things usually die. And they die thanks to corporate lobbyists and advocates of the rich and powerful, and are replaced by forms of relief that are upwardly redistributive that essentially exploit a crisis to transfer wealth and power to the top.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: Earlier in the 20th century, there was this perception that industry would contribute to solving a crisis with government. In this economy, we didn&#8217;t see a lot of the major tech companies, or a lot of the companies that were benefiting from this crisis, really sacrificing something to help the U.S. Do you see things that way?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>AG: I think that&#8217;s right. I&#8217;m always wary of idealizing certain periods in the past, and I think there were a lot of problems in that time. But I think there&#8217;s no question that it was not as difficult back then, as it is today, to summon some kind of sense of common purpose and even the need to sacrifice values like profit-seeking for other values.<\/p>\n<p>I mean, after 9\/11, President George W. Bush told us all to go shopping as the way to advance the common good. Donald Trump is now 18 levels of hell further down that path, not even telling us that we need to do anything for each other and [instead describing earlier this week] a pandemic that has killed 200,000 people as being something that doesn&#8217;t really affect most people.<\/p>\n<p>So there&#8217;s just been a coarsening. And that kind of selfish trajectory of our culture, after 40 years of being told that what we do alone is better than what we do together, that what we do to create wealth is more important than what we do to advance shared goals &#8212; that quite dismal, dull message has had its consequences. And when you get a pandemic like this, and you suddenly need to be able to summon people to all socially distance at a minimum or, more ambitiously, pull for the common good or pay higher taxes or things that might even cost them a little bit, it&#8217;s very hard to do because the groundwork isn&#8217;t there.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;ve talked quite a bit over the years about &#8220;fake change.&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>AG: Silicon Valley is the new Rome of our time, meaning a place in the world that ends up deciding how a lot of the rest of the world lives. No matter where you lived on the planet Earth, when the Roman Empire started to rise, it had plans for you one way or another, through your legal system, or your language, or culture, or something else. The Roman Empire was coming for you.<\/p>\n<p>Silicon Valley is that for our time. It&#8217;s the new Rome [in] that you can&#8217;t live on planet Earth and be unaffected, directly or indirectly, by the decisions made in this relatively small patch of [the world]. So the question then becomes, what does that new Rome want? And my impression of having reported on that world is that it&#8217;s an incredibly homogeneous world of people at the top of this new Rome. It&#8217;s white-male-dominated in a way that even other white-male-dominated sectors of the American economy are not . . . and it&#8217;s a lot of a certain kind of man who often is actually more obtuse about understanding human society and sociological dynamics and human beings than the average person.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe they didn&#8217;t spend a lot of time negotiating human dynamics at sleepovers, which is fine. But when you end up with a new Rome and it&#8217;s hyper dominated by people of one race and one gender, many of whom are disproportionately socially unintelligent, running the platforms through which most human sociality now occurs &#8212; democratic discourse, family community, so on and so forth &#8212; we all start to live in a world created by people who are just quite limited. They are smart at the thing they&#8217;re smart at, and they&#8217;ve become in charge of a lot of how the world works. And they are simply not up to the task. And we see evidence of that every day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: Are you speaking about empathy?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>AG: Empathy is absolutely one of [the factors]. The ability to understand the more amorphous, non technological, non quantifiable things . . . it&#8217;s so interesting, because it&#8217;s people who are clearly very smart in a certain area but&nbsp;just honestly do not understand democratic theory. There&#8217;s just so much work that&#8217;s been done &#8212; deep, complicated thinking going back to Plato and Aristotle, but also modern sociological work, including why a safety net and welfare is complicated. And there&#8217;s a certain kind of personality type that I have found very dominant in Silicon Valley, where it&#8217;s these men who just don&#8217;t really have a lens for that.<\/p>\n<p>They&#8217;re often geniuses. It&#8217;s a certain kind of particular personality type where you care a lot about one thing and you go deep on that one thing, and it&#8217;s probably the same personality type that Beethoven had. It&#8217;s a great thing, actually. It&#8217;s just not great for governing us, and what these people are doing is privately governing us, and they have no humility about the limitations of their worldview.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: We&#8217;re talking largely about social media here. Is it reasonable to expect some kind of government action. Do you think that&#8217;s naive?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>AG: It&#8217;s absolutely essential that the tech industry be brought into the same kind of sensible regulatory regime. I mean, you have kids, I have kids. If you&#8217;ve ever read the side of their car seats or any of the other products in their lives, you understand how much regulation there is for our benefit. . . I often say that the government at its best is like a lawyer for all of us. The government is like &#8216;Why don&#8217;t we check out these car seats for you and create some rules around them, and then you can just buy a car seat and not have to wonder whether it&#8217;s the kind that protects your child or crumbles?&#8217; That&#8217;s what the government does for all kinds of things.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;ve talked about billionaires who don&#8217;t want to pay taxes yet don&#8217;t hesitate to make a donation because they have control over where their money is spent and they get their name on a building, and it&#8217;s true. <a href=\"https:\/\/itep.org\/notadime\/#table\">Many<\/a> companies whose founders also consider themselves philanthropists, like Salesforce and Netflix, paid no federal tax in 2018, which amounts to billions of dollars lost. If you had to prioritize between taking antitrust action or closing the tax loopholes, which would you choose?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>AG: They&#8217;re both important. But I think I would prioritize taxation.<\/p>\n<p>One way to think about it is this pre distribution and redistribution. The monopoly issue in a way is pre distribution, which is how much money you get to make in the first place. If you get to be a monopoly because we don&#8217;t enforce antitrust laws, you&#8217;re going to end up making, pre tax, a lot more money than you would otherwise have made if you had to compete in an actual free market.<\/p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve made that money, the tax question comes up. So both are important, but I think you can&#8217;t overestimate the extent to which the tax thing is just totally foundational. If you look at the report that the 400 richest families in America pay a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/americas-richest-400-families-pay-a-lower-tax-rate-than-the-middle-class\/\">lower effective tax rate<\/a> than the bottom half of families, it&#8217;s appalling.<\/p>\n<p>We live in a complicated world. A lot of different things have been going on, including just in the last few months. But if you have to really summarize the drift and the shift of the last 40 years, it&#8217;s been a war on taxation. And it&#8217;s been a massive redistribution of wealth from the bottom to the top of American life through taxation. Since the &#8217;80s, the top 1% has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/releases\/z1\/dataviz\/dfa\/distribute\/chart\/#range:1989.3,2020.1\">gained $21 trillion of wealth<\/a>, and the bottom half of Americans have lost $900 billion of wealth on average &#8212;&nbsp; and much of that was prosecuted through the tax code.<\/p>\n<p><em>Awkward!

Now Showmac has convinced more investors to be onboard as it banked close to 100 million yuan ($15 million) in a Series A+ round led by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.addorcapital.com\/\">Addor Capital<\/a>, with participation from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/ggv-capital\">GGV Capital<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/aplus-capital\">Hongtai Aplus<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We believe cellular communication will become a mainstream trend in the era of IoT. Wi-Fi works only when it&#8217;s connected to a small number of devices, but when the number increases dramatically it becomes unreliable,&#8221; said Lily Liu, founder and chief executive of Showmac, during an interview with TechCrunch.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Unlike a traditional SIM, short for &#8220;subscriber identity module,&#8221; an eSIM doesn&#8217;t need to be on a removable card, doing away the need for the SIM card slot on a device. Rather, it will be welded onto the device&#8217;s integrated chip during assembly and is valid for different network operators. To chipmakers, Showmac&#8217;s eSIM functions like an application or software development kit (SDK), Liu observed.<\/p>\n<p>The company began as a pilot project supplying eSIMs to Xiaomi&#8217;s ecosystem of connected devices and subsequently set up an entity when the solution proved its viability. Its core products today include eSIM cards for IoT devices, an eSIM communication module and gateway, and connection management software as a service.<\/p>\n<p>To date, Showmac has powered more than 10 million devices, around 30% of which are affiliated with Xiaomi, which through in-house development and external investments has constructed an empire of IoT partners reliant on its operating system and consumer reach.<\/p>\n<p>The majority of Showmac&#8217;s clients are providers of shared goods, those of which &#8220;ownership and right to use are separate,&#8221; explained Liu, who earned a PhD in economics from China&#8217;s prestigious Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Shared bikes and Luckin&#8217;s shared coffee mugs are just a few examples.<\/p>\n<p>Showmac is hardly a forerunner in the global eSIM space, but the founder believed few competitors could match it on the level of supply chain resources, thanks to its ties with Xiaomi.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;As an R&amp;D-oriented and relatively young team, we are very fortunate to have experienced large-scale industrial activity that churns out products in the hundreds of thousands and even millions every day. [Xiaomi] has provided us with this precious opportunity,&#8221; the founder said.<\/p>\n<p>With a staff of 40-50 employees across Beijing and Shenzhen, the startup is currently focusing on the Chinese market, but has plans for overseas expansion in the long run.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are not the first to make eSIM in the world, but being in China, the center of the world&#8217;s electronics manufacturing, we are in a superior position to get things done,&#8221; suggested Liu.<\/p>\n<p>The arrival of 5G is a boon to the startup, the founder believed. &#8220;5G will spurn more IoT devices and applications, giving rise to the need for IoT [devices] with cross-carrier and cross-region capabilities,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>Showmac says it will spend its newly raised capital on mass-producing its integrated eSIM modules, research and development, and business development.<\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Connectivity is vital to a future managed and shaped by smart hardware, and Chinese startup Showmac Tech is proposing eSIMs as the infrastructure solution for seamless and stable communication between devices and the service providers behind.

Luckey announced on <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PalmerLuckey\/status\/1309231065274302465\">his Twitter account<\/a> Thursday that Anduril was one of the selected vendors for the project, known as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.af.mil\/News\/Article-Display\/Article\/2359938\/abms-signs-more-companies-post-onramp\/\">Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS)<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Over the last four months, the Air Force named more than 50 different vendors that would work on developing the system, giving each the chance to receive from $1,000 to $950 million over the next five years. Amazon Web Services was also selected in the fresh round of vendors, along with 16 other lesser-known companies.<\/p>\n<p>The vendor list includes a number of companies that aren&#8217;t the usual suspects in Department of Defense work, reflecting the &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.af.mil\/News\/Article-Display\/Article\/2244981\/abms-moves-ahead-with-second-round-of-contract-awards\/\">innovative acquisition strategy<\/a>&#8221; intended to accelerate the timeline for the ambitious system.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>As a three-year-old startup founded by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/anduril-palmer-luckeys-secretive-defense-company-is-booming-under-trump\">controversial Trump-booster<\/a> who <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2014\/03\/26\/a-brief-history-of-oculus\/\">created Oculus<\/a>, ushered in the dawn of consumer VR and was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2019\/05\/22\/oculus-co-founder-i-got-fired-from-facebook-for-no-reason-at-all.html\">eventually fired from Facebook<\/a>, Anduril fits the bill.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The goal of ABMS is to enable the Air Force and Space Force to operate together and as part of a joint team \u2013 connecting sensors, decision makers and weapons through a secure data network enabling rapid decision making and all-domain command and control,&#8221; according to an Air Force press release.<\/p>\n<p>Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Will Roper previously said that the ABMS competition would <a href=\"https:\/\/www.c4isrnet.com\/battlefield-tech\/it-networks\/2020\/06\/02\/air-force-to-dole-out-nearly-1-billion-for-abms-development\/\">bring in &#8220;fresh blood,&#8221;<\/a> particularly commercially focused companies &#8220;that know a lot about data, that know a lot about machine learning and [artificial intelligence] and know a lot about analytics.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Anduril has already picked up a surprising amount of federal work in its short lifespan. In June the Trump administration awarded Anduril a contract to build a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbp.gov\/newsroom\/national-media-release\/cbp-s-autonomous-surveillance-towers-declared-program-record-along\">so-called virtual border wall<\/a> comprised of its drones, sensor towers and AI software system \u2014 an opportunity that the company seemed custom-built for from its launch.<\/p>\n<p>The ABMS project will ultimately fit into the Defense Department&#8217;s work on a system known as Joint All-Domain Command &amp; Control, or JADC2, a kind of meta software platform for warfare that connects all humans, devices and equipment across the domains of air, land, sea, space and cyber &#8212; and even the electromagnetic spectrum.<\/p>\n<p>Per Luckey&#8217;s tweet, Anduril&#8217;s new contract is &#8220;for the maturation, demonstration and proliferation of capability across platforms and domains, leveraging open systems design, modern software and algorithm development in order to enable Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2).&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;[JADC2] aims to link every ship, soldier, and jet, so that ground, air, sea, space, and cyber assets can share the exact same data and can be used almost interchangeably to take out targets, even in environments where communication is being heavily jammed or where adversaries have advanced air defenses,&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.defenseone.com\/technology\/2020\/02\/war-autopilot-it-will-be-harder-pentagon-thinks\/163064\/\">Defense One explained<\/a> in a piece on the project.<\/p>\n<p>Working with the Department of Defense has been Anduril&#8217;s endgame from day one.

you must. It\u2019s the latest online dustup, following Apple\u2019s recent Watch Series 6 release. The announcement of the Solo Loop was more or less glossed over during last week\u2019s big event, because, well, watch bands don\u2019t often take center stage at hardware events.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As is often the case, retail availability was quickly followed by purchaser returns. That happens just about any time a new product is released, of course, but things were complicated here for a couple of reasons. For starters, the clasp-free bands come in a variety of different sizes to fit different-sized wrists. That\u2019s further complicated by the fact that trying bands on in-store really isn\u2019t a great option these days.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The initial returns were met with buyer frustration. For starters, many were reporting difficulty getting the correctly sized band, based on online measurements. Also many expressed frustration with a policy that required the entire watch to be sent back to Apple as part of the return process.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><div id=\"attachment_2051779\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2051779\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2051779\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-24-at-5.06.44-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"446\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-24-at-5.06.44-PM.png 1638w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-24-at-5.06.44-PM.png?resize=150,65 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-24-at-5.06.44-PM.png?resize=300,131 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-24-at-5.06.44-PM.png?resize=768,335 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-24-at-5.06.44-PM.png?resize=680,296 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-24-at-5.06.44-PM.png?resize=1536,670 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-24-at-5.06.44-PM.png?resize=50,22 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2051779\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Apple<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Apple has since clarified and addressed some of the issues. For starters, users can now just replace the band (rather than the entire Watch) either in-store or by mail. That is assuming they have the replacement size. Apparently the company\u2019s been having some trouble keeping some of the styles\/sizes in stock. The company has also updated the pricing chart for the bands with additional detail to get a better fit. The process involves printing out the tool, cutting it out and then wrapping it around your wrist. Not exactly the<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>most high-tech or most ideal method, but it should hopefully work in a pinch.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I will say for my part that I quite like the band. It\u2019s comfortable and it\u2019s got a nice elastic spring that adheres nicely to movement. I\u2019m a fan of the braided version in particular. That said, the company seemed to have triangulated my potential size and gave me a couple of options to try. One of them fits nicely. Not everyone has the ability to do that from home, so you\u2019ll want to get it as close as you can using that tool.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And keep in mind, it\u2019s not simply a comfort thing, either.

But iPhone home screen customization never really took off until this month, thanks to the launch of iOS 14. With the OS update, developers have finally been able to ship widgets of different sizes alongside their apps to offer a more engaging experience directly on users&#8217; home screens.<\/p>\n<p>While the original intention was focused on bringing informational updates from existing apps to the home screen, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/23\/top-20-ios-homescreen-customization-apps-reach-5-7m-installs-after-ios-14-release\/\">a handful of developers leveraged<\/a> the new capabilities to build specialized widget design tools. These widget-making apps have allowed users to create widgets of many sorts and sizes, using a variety of colors and styles. Widgetsmith, for example, has been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/23\/top-20-ios-homescreen-customization-apps-reach-5-7m-installs-after-ios-14-release\/\">topping<\/a> the App Store charts as users began to customize their home screens.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, a number of users figured out <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/21\/how-to-make-the-most-of-ios-14-widgets-and-iphone-home-screen-customization\/\">how to use Apple&#8217;s Shortcuts<\/a> to replace the icons associated with their favorite apps in order to create entirely unique, themed home screen experiences. Tutorials popped up on TikTok and the hashtag <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/ios14homescreen?src=hashtag_click\">#iOS14homescreen<\/a> began trending on Twitter as people shared the end results of their iPhone makeovers.<\/p>\n<p>But one obstacle to redesigning the home screen was that you either needed to find a set of custom icons to use or design your own using an app like PicsArt or Photoshop, for example. And this could be challenging for those who don&#8217;t regularly work with creative tools.

Americans scramble to keep access to TikTok and WeChat amid a looming government ban. There are dozens of free VPNs out there that promise to protect your privacy by keeping you anonymous on the internet and hiding your browsing history.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t believe it. Free VPNs are bad for you.<\/p>\n<p>The internet is a hostile place for the privacy-minded. Internet providers can <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/03\/28\/house-vote-sj-34-isp-regulations-fcc\/\">sell your browsing history<\/a>, governments can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2013\/jul\/31\/nsa-top-secret-program-online-data\">spy on you<\/a> and tech titans <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/19\/oracle-bluekai-web-tracking\/\">collect huge amounts of data<\/a> to track you across the web. Many have turned to VPNs, or virtual private networks, thinking that they can protect you from snoopers and spies.<\/p>\n<p>But where VPNs try to solve a problem, they can also expose you to far greater privacy risks.<\/p>\n<p>TechCrunch&#8217;s Romain Dillet has an explainer on <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/01\/01\/wtf-is-a-vpn\/\">what a VPN is<\/a>. In short, VPNs were first designed for employees to virtually connect to their office network from home or while on a business trip. These days, VPNs are more widely used for hiding your online internet traffic, and tricking streaming services into thinking you&#8217;re another country when you&#8217;re not. That same technique also helps activists and dissidents bypass censorship systems in their own countries.<\/p>\n<p>VPNs work by funneling all of your internet traffic through an encrypted pipe to the VPN server, making it more difficult for anyone on the internet to see which sites you are visiting or which apps you are using.<\/p>\n<p>But VPNs don&#8217;t inherently protect your privacy or give you anonymity. VPNs simply divert all of your internet traffic from going to your internet provider&#8217;s systems into the VPN provider&#8217;s systems instead.<\/p>\n<p>That begs the question: Why should you trust a VPN that promises to protect your privacy more than your internet provider? The answer is that you can&#8217;t, and you shouldn&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"xCy8Gt6G33\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/01\/01\/wtf-is-a-vpn\/\">WTF is a VPN?<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;WTF is a VPN?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/01\/01\/wtf-is-a-vpn\/embed\/#?secret=xCy8Gt6G33\" data-secret=\"xCy8Gt6G33\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>By far, some of the worst offenders are the free VPNs.<\/p>\n<p>As the old adage goes, if it&#8217;s free then you are the product. What that means is that they make money off you \u2014 specifically, your data. Like any service that costs nothing, VPNs are often supported by ads. That means taking your internet traffic and selling it to the highest bidder to serve you targeted ads while you&#8217;re connected to the VPN. Other free VPNs <a href=\"https:\/\/arstechnica.com\/tech-policy\/2017\/08\/ftc-must-scrutinize-hotspot-shield-over-alleged-traffic-interception-group-says\/\">have been accused<\/a> of injecting ads into the websites that you visit.<\/p>\n<p>While there are paid and premium VPNs that are generally more mindful about your privacy, they aren&#8217;t anonymous, as they can be linked to your billing address. Paid VPNs also don&#8217;t solve the problem of funneling all of your internet traffic to a potentially untrustworthy company.<\/p>\n<p>Some VPN providers also claim to protect your privacy by not storing any logs or track which websites you visit or when. While that may be true in some cases, there&#8217;s no way you can be completely sure.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, some VPN providers have claimed they don&#8217;t store any logs \u2014 but were proven completely false.<\/p>\n<p>Take UFO VPN, which at the time had about 20 million users. It claimed to have a zero-logging policy. But security researchers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theregister.com\/2020\/07\/17\/ufo_vpn_database\/\">found the company&#8217;s logging database<\/a> exposed to the internet, no password needed. The database was packed with logs of user activity, including which websites users were visiting.<\/p>\n<p>Former NYPD director of cyber intelligence and investigations Nick Selby, now the chief security officer at fintech company Paxos, said he only uses VPN providers that he knows do not store any logs. During his time as a police officer he would serve search warrants and know which providers were &#8220;the best at giving me nothing,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not to say that all VPNs are unscrupulous or invading your privacy. Much of the problem with VPNs is that you can&#8217;t look under the hood and see what&#8217;s going on with your data. Standalone VPNs, like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/04\/09\/how-i-made-my-own-vpn-server-in-15-minutes\/\">Algo<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/18\/vpn-protocol-wireguard-now-has-an-official-macos-app\/\">WireGuard<\/a>, let you create and control your own VPN server through a cloud service, like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud or Digital Ocean. But remember: your encrypted data is stored on another company&#8217;s cloud, making it potentially susceptible to being grabbed by the authorities.<\/p>\n<p>VPNs can be useful, but it&#8217;s important to know their limitations. Just don&#8217;t rely on them to protect your privacy or your anonymity.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Okk4OweUBx\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/09\/02\/13-ways-to-screw-over-your-internet-provider\/\">13 ways to screw over your internet provider<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;13 ways to screw over your internet provider&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/09\/02\/13-ways-to-screw-over-your-internet-provider\/embed\/#?secret=Okk4OweUBx\" data-secret=\"Okk4OweUBx\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>VPNs are in high demand as Americans scramble to keep access to TikTok and WeChat amid a looming government ban.

Sense review"},"content":{"rendered":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">The Versa helped<\/span> Fitbit reverse its fortunes after a long, gradual slide. The company was slow to embrace the smartwatch, and stumbled somewhat out of the gate with the Ionic. But the Versa found a perfect sweet spot that build atop generations of wearable health knowhow, key acquisitions like Pebble and a pricing sweet spot at $200.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In fact, other big-name smartwatch makers like Apple and Samsung have since followed suit, offering up more budget-friendly approaches to the category. The moves came as <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/fitbit\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"fitbit\">Fitbit <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and a slew of Chinese device makers were nabbing market share through budget plays. But while the competition zigs, Fitbit zags, I suppose. That\u2019s where the Sense comes in. It\u2019s a return to the premium pricing the company put on hold when it let the Ionic fade away.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"YrEDy3DgyL\"><p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/25\/fitbit-launches-a-330-apple-watch-competitor\/\">Fitbit launches a $330 Apple Watch competitor<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Fitbit launches a $330 Apple Watch competitor&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/25\/fitbit-launches-a-330-apple-watch-competitor\/embed\/#?secret=YrEDy3DgyL\" data-secret=\"YrEDy3DgyL\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">At $330, the Sense falls under the lower end of premium \u2014 at least compared to say, the Apple Watch Series 6 and Galaxy Watch 3, which both start at $399. The premium market isn\u2019t the most logical play for a company that has been successful at a lower price point, but it\u2019s perhaps understandable that the company is interested in expanding on its fortunes, legacy software and health metrics and finally, properly trying to beat Apple at its own game.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2051725\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2051725\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2051725\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-21-052627611-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-21-052627611-1.jpg 4000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-21-052627611-1.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-21-052627611-1.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-21-052627611-1.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-21-052627611-1.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-21-052627611-1.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-21-052627611-1.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-21-052627611-1.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2051725\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">While Fitbit has a bit of a history flooding the market with different devices, I do think the decision to introduce an entirely new product makes sense here. Really, the worst Fitbit could have done was add a bunch of features to the Versa and raise the price by $100, thus removing one of the product\u2019s primary selling points in the process (though the Versa\u2019s price has also increased to $220).<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The truth is, the Sense and Versa 3 are actually more alike than they are different. The similarities start with the casing. The two products look virtually identical, aside from some different color options. The Sense comes in, arguably, classier colors with either gray or gold. The display is the company\u2019s familiar squircle, which is only available in the one size.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I suspect Fitbit learned its lesson about unwieldy watch designs with the Ionic. The device sports a 1.58-inch display, which feels about right. And the square design makes it feel more compact than Apple\u2019s comparably sized watch. That said, more watch sizes is always a good thing, particularly for a product like the Sense that\u2019s attempting to appeal to a wide range of wearers.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Unlike Samsung and Apple\u2019s smartwatches, there\u2019s no standalone dial-button for navigating through screens. There is a pressure-sensitive button on the side of the device, though that ultimately was a bit of a nuisance. I found myself repeatedly accidentally triggering it while moving my wrist. And honestly, for most actions, simply swiping across screens is perfectly fine.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2051726\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2051726\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2051726\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-21-052610012-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-21-052610012-1.jpg 3643w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-21-052610012-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-21-052610012-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-21-052610012-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-21-052610012-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-21-052610012-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-21-052610012-1.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-21-052610012-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2051726\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As the name implies, the biggest difference between Fitbit\u2019s latest smartwatches comes down to sensors. The Sense has a lot packed in here. Both feature optical heart-rate monitoring, a temperature monitor and an SpO2 sensor \u2014 which was possibly the biggest upgrade announced for the Apple Watch Series 6. The Sense, however, is alone as the first Fitbit to adopt an ECG sensor, bringing it up to speed with the new Apple Watch on that front.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As is often the case with these sorts of sensors, I\u2019m unable to really highlight it in the review. FDA clearance seems to be a bit more straightforward as the feature has become more and more common on consumer devices, but while Fitbit has cleared it, the functionality won\u2019t be rolled out on the devices until next month. When it does arrive, you\u2019ll get the kind of health readouts we\u2019ve come to expect from these sensors, including heart rhythms and notifications for any usual activity.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"1n7YzcIK6v\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/25\/fitbit-intros-the-versa-3-and-inspire-2\/\">Fitbit intros the Versa 3 and Inspire 2<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Fitbit intros the Versa 3 and Inspire 2&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/25\/fitbit-intros-the-versa-3-and-inspire-2\/embed\/#?secret=1n7YzcIK6v\" data-secret=\"1n7YzcIK6v\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sleep tracking is one place Fitbit has had Apple beat for some time. The latter is attempting to change that with the latest version of watchOS, but still has a lot of work to do in order to catch up. The array of sensors go a long ways toward providing a more complete picture of your sleep over the course of the night. While Apple\u2019s offering largely revolves around things like time in bed and time asleep, Fitbit provides a fuller picture, including, importantly, sleep quality, broken up by REM, light and deep sleep. SpO2 and heart rate are also factored into the picture. SpO2, in particular, will become an increasingly important factor in sleep going forward, as these devices look to track things like sleep apnea.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Another big piece of sleep is battery life. That\u2019s something Fitbit\u2019s been good at for a while. The Sense is rated at six days. Your mileage is going to vary considerably, however, depending on whether you opt for the always on display and other features. As it stands, I was able to get several days on a single charge with the feature switched off. Frankly, that\u2019s a pretty big advantage over Apple\u2019s stated 18 hours. Charging each night before bed or first time in the morning isn\u2019t ideal.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2051727\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2051727\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2051727\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-21-052701987-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-21-052701987-1.jpg 4000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-21-052701987-1.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-21-052701987-1.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-21-052701987-1.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-21-052701987-1.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-21-052701987-1.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-21-052701987-1.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-21-052701987-1.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2051727\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong>\u00a0Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I appreciate Fitbit\u2019s focus on mindfulness. I think it\u2019s something we can all use a bit more of these days. I definitely include myself in that boat. Fitbit is one of a handful of smartwatch makers currently looking to push the concept beyond simple breathing exercises. That\u2019s included in the Mindfulness tile. The company will quantify relaxation using the the on-board sensors. I honestly haven\u2019t used it a ton, but anything that can help jumpstart a mindfulness practice is a net positive.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Sense\u2019s software continues to still be fairly basic. And while there are plenty of watch faces, the app selection lags behind some of the bigger names. It will be interesting to watch how Fitbit\u2019s approach to software changes if\/when the Google acquisition goes through. After all, wearOS has been around for a while and received plenty of updates, but still has its share of shortcomings.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Qf0rA6S2vu\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/09\/09\/fitbit-versa-2-review\/\">Fitbit Versa 2 review<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Fitbit Versa 2 review&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/09\/09\/fitbit-versa-2-review\/embed\/#?secret=Qf0rA6S2vu\" data-secret=\"Qf0rA6S2vu\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Sense\u2019s strong suit is also Fitbit\u2019s: a strong underpinning of health and fitness focus. The company certainly has a good, solid history of upgrades. But while it packs more sensors than the Versa 3, for many the difference will be relatively minor \u2014 and perhaps difficult to justify that $100 price gap. I\u2019ve yet to spend a lot of time with the latest version of that device, but if past is any prologue, it\u2019s a solid choice for those looking for an Android-compatible Apple alternative at a good price.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Versa helped Fitbit reverse its fortunes after a long, gradual slide.

more than most to push cryptocurrencies closer to the mainstream, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/10\/30\/coinbase-is-now-valued-at-8b-after-closing-new-300m-round\/\">earning an $8 billion valuation<\/a> by private investors along the way. The company is <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/09\/coinbase-reported-to-consider-late-2020-early-2021-public-debut\/\">reportedly eyeing a public listing<\/a> next year, and is inarguably doing a lot of things right. However, that doesn&#8217;t mean its product experience is perfect. In fact, far from it.<\/p>\n<p>In our latest UX teardown, with the help of <a href=\"https:\/\/builtformars.co.uk\/\">Built for Mars<\/a> founder and UX expert Peter Ramsey, we highlight some of Coinbase&#8217;s biggest user experience failings and offer ways to fix them. Many of these lessons can be applied to other existing digital products or ones you are currently building, including the need to avoid the &#8220;Get Started&#8221; trap, the importance of providing feedback, why familiarity often wins and other principles.<\/p>\n<h2>The \u2018Get Started\u2019 trap<\/h2>\n<p>Only use CTAs like \u201cget started\u201d or \u201clearn more\u201d if you\u2019re actually teaching users something.<\/p>\n<p>The fail: <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/coinbase\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"coinbase\">Coinbase <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> doesn\u2019t actually have any onboarding \u2014 but it looks like it does. It has a very prominent \u201cget started\u201d CTA, which actually just puts bitcoins in your basket. This isn\u2019t helping you get started, it\u2019s nothing more than an onboarding Trojan horse.<\/p>\n<p>The fix: It\u2019s simple: Don\u2019t lie in your CTAs. You wouldn\u2019t have \u201cEmail Support\u201d as a CTA, and then just show the user a bunch of FAQs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Steve O\u2019Hear: This feels like another classic &#8220;bait and switch&#8221; and reeks of dark pattern design. However, what if it actually works to get users over the line and purchase their first bitcoin? Growth hackers, rejoice, no?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/peter-ramsey\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"peter-ramsey\">Peter Ramsey:<\/strong> <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> You\u2019re absolutely right, this may convert better. From a business point of view, this could be a brilliant little growth hack. However, something converting well doesn\u2019t mean it was a good experience for the user. Look at clickbait-y journalism \u2014 it gets more eyeballs, but people aren\u2019t generally happy with what they read.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m convinced that in the long term having a great product will perform better than frustrating short-term growth hacks.<\/p>\n<h2>Feedback architecture<\/h2>\n<p>As a general rule of thumb, all &#8220;states&#8221; &#8212; e.g., success\/failure of an action &#8212; need to provide feedback to the user.<\/p>\n<p>The fail: After adding a card, you click &#8220;Add Card,&#8221; and \u2026 it takes you back to the homepage. There\u2019s no notice if it was successful or not. The user has no awareness if the action they were trying to do failed and they need to do it again. This is a real problem with digital products: All feedback needs to be thought of and built.<\/p>\n<p>The fix: During the design phase, consider statuses and what the user will want feedback on. For example, if they\u2019ve just added an item to their &#8220;wishlist,&#8221; how will you show them that the action was successful?<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Digital currency exchange Coinbase has probably done more than most to push cryptocurrencies closer to the mainstream, earning an $8 billion valuation by private investors along the way.

As a programming note, I am off next week effectively, so look for Natasha to lead on Equity Monday and then both her and Danny to rock the Thursday show. I will miss everyone.<\/p>\n<p>But onto the show itself, here&#8217;s what we got into:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/23\/class-for-zoom-earliest-investors-are-betting-millions\/\">Zoom&#8217;s earliest investors are betting millions on a better Zoom for schools<\/a>:<\/strong> Built on Natasha&#8217;s reporting, we took a look at a neat company that wants to make Zoom better for the educational environments where it had suddenly taken the center stage.

As a result, we have decided to not proceed with the deal with ICE. &#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Hootsuite, which makes social media management and marketing software, is headquartered in Canada and appears to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usaspending.gov\/search\/ba15245aaf8e89f70e535ce4f9796c57\">provide software to U.S. federal agencies<\/a> sporadically.<\/p>\n<p>The company didn&#8217;t directly enter into the relationship with ICE, a common strategy for obtaining and sometimes obscuring federal contract work. A third-party company called FCN was awarded a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.usaspending.gov\/award\/CONT_AWD_70CTD020FR0000270_7012_HSHQDC13D00017_7001\">\u00a0<\/a>one year <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usaspending.gov\/award\/CONT_AWD_70CTD020FR0000270_7012_HSHQDC13D00017_7001\">base contract worth $508,832<\/a> to provide ICE with licenses to Hootsuite&#8217;s software.<\/p>\n<p>Because the contract is through an intermediary and went into effect on September 18, it&#8217;s not clear how Hootsuite will back out of the work. TechCrunch has contacted FCN and ICE for additional details about the contract and its termination and will update this story if we receive new information.<\/p>\n<p>Keiser&#8217;s full statement is provided below.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Although I typically would not make a public statement about our customers and our contracts, in this instance I feel it\u2019s important. Recently our company has had to go through the process of determining whether we would engage in a contract with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). That sparked a great deal of internal conversation\u2014and the formation of a committee to further that discussion and consider all points of view. Considering the various factors, including our belief in the power of communications and social engagement to break down barriers, and supported by the set of objective guidelines that emerged from that committee, we made the decision to proceed with signing a contract with ICE. Over the last 24 hours there has been a broad emotional and passionate reaction from our people and this has spurred additional dialog. We have heard the lived experiences from our people and the hurt they are feeling. The decision has created a divided company, and this is not the kind of company I came to lead. I\u2014and the rest of the management team\u2014share the concerns our people have expressed.
