Watch Series 6 review"},"content":{"rendered":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">When it comes<\/span> to smartwatches, it\u2019s Apple against the world. It\u2019s not that there aren\u2019t plenty of other products to choose from \u2014 it\u2019s more that the company has just utterly dominated the space to such a point that any other device is relegated to the realm of \u201c<a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Watch alternatives.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The company has been successful in the space for the usual Apple reasons: premium hardware with deeply integrated software, third-party support, a large cross-device ecosystem play and, of, course, simplicity. Taken as a whole, the Watch just works, right out of the box.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Five years after launch, the line is fairly mature. As such, it\u2019s no surprise, really, that recent updates have largely amounted to refinements. As with most updates, the watch has gotten a processor boost up to the A14 processor, which the company claims is 20% faster than the last version.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>Perhaps the biggest hardware upgrade, however, is the addition of a blood oxygen sensor, an important piece in the company\u2019s quest to offer as complete an image of wearer health as is possible from the wrist.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Dkvjc9vzsO\"><p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/a-closer-look-at-the-new-apple-watches\/\">A closer look at the new Apple Watches<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;A closer look at the new Apple Watches&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/a-closer-look-at-the-new-apple-watches\/embed\/#?secret=Dkvjc9vzsO\" data-secret=\"Dkvjc9vzsO\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">I wrote<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/a-closer-look-at-the-new-apple-watches\/\"> a pretty lengthy piece<\/a> about the watch last week after wearing it for a few days. As I mentioned at the time, it was an odd kind of writeup, somewhere between hands-on and review. A week or so later, however, I\u2019m more comfortable calling this a review \u2014 even if not too many of my initial impressions have changed much in the past several days. After all, a mature product largely means most of the foundations remain unchanged.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Series 6 certainly looks the part. The Watch is tough to distinguish from other recent models \u2014 and for that matter, the new and significantly cheaper SE. The biggest visual change is the addition of new colors. In addition to the standard Gray and Gold, Apple\u2019s added new Blue and (Product)Red cases. The latter seems to be the more ostentatious of the pair. The company sent me a blue model, and honestly, it\u2019s a lot more subtle than I expected. It\u2019s more of a deep blue hue, really, that reads more as black a lot of the time.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s tough to imagine the product undergoing any sort of radical rethink of the device\u2019s design language at this point. We may see slight tweaks, including larger screen area going forward, but on the whole, Apple is very much committed to a form factor that has worked very well for it. I will probably always prefer Samsung\u2019s spinning bezel as a quick way to interface with the operating system, but the crown does the job well and scrolling through menus even feels a bit zippier this time, perhaps owing to that faster silicon.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"LWNvL7GOH3\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/you-can-now-return-apples-solo-loop-for-a-new-size-without-sending-back-the-watch\/\">You can now return Apple\u2019s Solo Loop for a new size, without sending back the Watch<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;You can now return Apple\u2019s Solo Loop for a new size, without sending back the Watch&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/you-can-now-return-apples-solo-loop-for-a-new-size-without-sending-back-the-watch\/embed\/#?secret=LWNvL7GOH3\" data-secret=\"LWNvL7GOH3\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">The new Solo Loop bands hit a bit of a hiccup out of the gate. I\u2019ve <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/you-can-now-return-apples-solo-loop-for-a-new-size-without-sending-back-the-watch\/\">detailed that a bit more here<\/a>, but I suspect that much of the problem came down to the difficulty of selling a specifically sized product during a strange period in history where in-person try-ons aren\u2019t really an option. In other words, just really bad timing on that front.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Personally, I quite like the braided model. I\u2019ve been using it as my day to day band. It\u2019s nice and blends in a lot better than the silicone model (I\u2019ve frankly never been much of a fan of Apple\u2019s silicone bands). But I do need to mention that Apple sent me a couple different sizes, which made it much easier to find the right fit. I recognize that. Especially when the braided Solo Loop costs a fairly exorbitant $99. The silicone version is significantly cheaper at $49, but either way, you\u2019re not getting off cheap there. So you definitely want to make sure you get the right fit.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052164\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052164\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2052164\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg 4000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013856490.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052164\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This is doubly important given the fact that the Series 6\u2019s biggest new feature \u2014 blood oxygen monitoring \u2014 is highly dependent on you getting a good fit. The sensor utilizes a series of LEDs on the bottom of the watch to shine infrared and red light through the wearer\u2019s skin and into their blood vessels. The color of light that reflects back gives the watch a picture of the oxygen levels in the blood. The whole thing takes about 15 seconds, but only works if your fit is right. Even with the right Solo Loop on, I found myself having to retake it a few times when I first started wearing the watch.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Beyond the on-demand measurements, the watch will also take readings throughout the day and night, mapping these trends over time and incorporating them into sleep readings. The overall readings will give you a good picture of your numbers over time. Honestly though, I get the sense that this is really just the tip of the iceberg of future functionality.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For now, there\u2019s really no specific guidance \u2014 or context \u2014 given as far as what the numbers mean. Mine are generally between 90-100%. The Mayo Clinic tells me that\u2019s good, but obviously there are a lot of different factors and variations that can\u2019t properly be contextualized in a single paragraph &#8212; or on a watch. And Apple certainly doesn\u2019t want to be accused of attempting to diagnose a condition or offer specific medical guidance. That\u2019s going to be an increasingly difficult line for the company to walk as it gets more serious about these sorts of health tools.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If I had to venture a guess, I would say that the combination of sleep tracking in watchOS 7 and the on-board oximeter opens the door pretty nicely for something like sleep apnea tracking (again, more focused on alerts of irregularity versus diagnosis). We\u2019ve seen a small handful of companies like Withings tackle this, so it seems like a no-brainer for Apple, pending all of the regulatory requirements, et al. There are all sorts of other conditions that blood oxygen levels could potentially alert the wearer to, if not actually diagnose.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sleep was probably the biggest addition with the latest version of watchOS. This was probably the biggest blind spot for the line, compared to the competition. At the moment, the sleep tracking is, admittedly, still pretty basic. Like much of the rest of the on-board tracking, it\u2019s mostly compared with changes over time. The metrics include time in bed versus time asleep, as well as incorporating heart rate figures from the sensor\u2019s regular check-ins. More specific breakdowns, including deep versus light versus REM sleep haven\u2019t arrived yet, but will no doubt be coming sooner than later.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052166\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052166\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2052166 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg 4000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013830120.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052166\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The door is also wide open for Apple to really get mindfulness right. The company has incorporated a mindfulness reminder for a while now, but it\u2019s easy to imagine how the addition of various sensors like heart rate could really improve the picture and find the company going all-in on meditation, et al. The company could partner with a big meditation name \u2014 or, more likely, disrupt things with its own offering. The forthcoming Fitness+ offering could play an important role in the growth of that category, as well.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The other issue that sleep brings to the front is battery life. I was banking on the company making big strides in the battery department \u2014 after all, a big part of sleep tracking is ensuring that you\u2019ve got enough charge to get through the night. Apple really only briefly touched on battery \u2014 though <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ifixit.com\/Teardown\/Apple+Watch+Series+6+Teardown\/136694?utm_content=buffer408ad&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\">a recent teardown<\/a> has revealed some smallish improvements on battery capacity (perhaps owing, in part, to space freed up by the dropping of Force Touch).<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The company has also made some improvements to energy efficiency, courtesy of the new silicon. Official literature puts it at a \u201cfull-day\u201d of<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>battery life, up to 18 hours. I found I was able to get through a full day with juice to spare. That\u2019s good, but the company\u2019s still got some ground to make up on that front, compared to, say, the Fitbit Sense, which is capable of getting nearly a week on a charge. I think at this point, it\u2019s fair to hold wearables to higher standards of battery life than, say, handsets. More than once, I\u2019ve found myself intermittently charging the device \u2014 20 minutes here and 20 minutes there \u2014 in order to have enough juice left by bedtime.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"GxSVdjFou2\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/29\/apple-began-work-on-the-watchs-hand-washing-feature-years-before-covid-19\/\">Apple began work on the Watch\u2019s handwashing feature years before COVID-19<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Apple began work on the Watch\u2019s handwashing feature years before COVID-19&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/29\/apple-began-work-on-the-watchs-hand-washing-feature-years-before-covid-19\/embed\/#?secret=GxSVdjFou2\" data-secret=\"GxSVdjFou2\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you can spare more time than that, you should be able to get up to 80% in an hour or 100% in an hour and a half, courtesy of faster wireless charging. All told, the company has been able to shave significant time off of charging \u2014 a definite plus now that you\u2019re not just leaving it overnight to charge. The latest version of watchOS will also handily let you know before if you don\u2019t have enough charge to make it through a full night.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Other updates include the addition of the always-on Altimeter, which, along with the brighter screen doesn\u2019t appear to have had a major impact on the battery. I\u2019ll be honest, being stuck in the city for these last several months hasn\u2019t given me much reason to need real-time elevation stats. Though the feature is a nice step toward taking the Watch a bit more seriously as an outdoor accessory in a realm that has largely been dominated by the likes of Garmin.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052167\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052167\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2052167\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg 4000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2020-09-25-013942780.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052167\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Of course, the company now has three watches on the market \u2014 including the Series 3, which just keeps on ticking, and the lower-cost SE. The latter retains the design of the Series 6, but drops a number of the key sensors, which honestly should be perfectly sufficient for many users \u2014 and $170 cheaper than the 6\u2019s $399 starting price ($499 with cellular).<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Taken as a whole, the Series 6 isn\u2019t a huge leap forward over the Series 5 \u2014 and not really worth the upgrade for those who already own that recent vintage.

company he runs with managing partner Mary Chan, and would be part of a consortium of investors, according to one unnamed source who requested anonymity because the deal had yet to be finalized. The deal could close as early as mid-October.<\/p>\n<p>TuSimple as well as Girsky declined to comment.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>It&#8217;s no secret that TuSimple has been seeking new capital.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/26\/tusimple-seeking-250-million-in-new-funding-to-scale-self-driving-trucks\/\">TechCrunch reported in June that TuSimple was in search of $250 million<\/a> in fresh capital from investors. The company hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to help it raise funds, according to multiple sources familiar with the effort. Since then, TuSimple, which already has backing from Sina, UPS and Tier 1 supplier Mando Corp., has announced a partnership with Navistar and most recently, the Traton Group.<\/p>\n<p>Girsky has most recently captured headlines because of Nikola, where he is now the executive chairman. Girsky took over as chairman in September after Nikola&#8217;s founder, Trevor Milton, stepped down following fallout from <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/nikola-disputes-fraud-claims-in-carefully-worded-rebuttal\/\">a scathing report<\/a> by short-seller firm Hindenburg Research that accused the company of fraud. VectoIQ Acquisition Corp., the SPAC that Girsky formed in 2018, announced a merger with Nikola in March, and Girsky oversaw its public listing this past June. He shepherded an introduction between Nikola and his former boss, GM CEO and chairwoman Mary Barra, according to one source familiar with the deal. By mid-September the automaker had announced a partnership valued at $2 billion with Nikola.<\/p>\n<p>Girsky may be Nikola&#8217;s new chairman and certainly has executive experience, but his focus in recent years has been as an advisor, investor and matchmaker. Girsky has long had an interest in mobility-related companies. His firm VectoIQ LLC specializes in advising companies and connecting large companies with startups working on autonomous vehicle technology, electrification, connected, cybersecurity and mobility-as-a-service.<\/p>\n<p>VectoIQ invested in lidar startup Luminar, which recently announced it was going public through a SPAC merger with Gores Metropoulos Inc., at a post-deal market valuation of $3.4 billion. Girsky also sat on the board of autonomous vehicle startup Drive.ai, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/06\/25\/self-driving-startup-drive-ai-is-closing-down\/\">which was acquired by Apple<\/a> as the company prepared to shut down.<\/p>\n<p>Girsky&#8217;s investment in TuSimple is separate from his interests in Nikola, which has yet to begin production of its Class 8 trucks, according to sources.<\/p>\n<p>TuSimple, which launched in 2015 and has operations in China, San Diego and Tucson, Arizona, is focused on the autonomous vehicle technology stack that will allow Class 8 trucks to operate without a human driver. TuSimple operates a fleet of 40 self-driving trucks in the U.S. that are used for testing and to carry freight between Arizona and Texas.<\/p>\n<p>TuSimple announced in July plans to develop and begin producing autonomous semi trucks by 2024 in partnership with Navistar. In September, Volkswagen AG&#8217;s heavy-truck business Traton Group said it took a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/23\/vws-traton-group-strikes-a-deal-with-tusimple-to-develop-autonomous-trucks\/\">minority stake in TuSimple<\/a> as part of an agreement between the two companies to develop self-driving trucks. Neither company disclosed the financial terms of the partnership or the percentage of the minority stake. Traton did make a direct capital investment into TuSimple, according to one unnamed source familiar with the deal. It&#8217;s unclear if it also included in-kind contributions.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Steve Girsky, the former GM vice chairman, consultant and investor whose special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merged with hydrogen electric startup Nikola this summer, is in talks to back self-driving trucks startup TuSimple, according to four people familiar with the deal.

href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/alexisohanian\">Alexis Ohanian<\/a>, the co-founder of Reddit and early-stage VC firm Initialized Capital, is raising a new fund, named 776, with a target of $150

The filing comes <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/26\/alexis-ohanian-reddit-co-founder-is-leaving-initialized-capital\/\">three months<\/a> after the entrepreneur left Initialized Capital and a month after The Information <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theinformation.com\/articles\/reddit-co-founder-alexis-ohanian-plots-new-early-stage-vc-fund\">first reported<\/a> on his plans. Ohanian declined to comment on details regarding the fund due to general solicitation restraints.<\/p>\n<p>Along the filing, the fund launched an intentionally cryptic new website:<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sevensevensix.com\/\"> sevensevensix.com<\/a>. It appears that the name of the fund is a reference to when the first Olympics were held, in 776 B.C.E.<\/p>\n<p>The website reads: &#8220;The first Olympics brought the best athletes from all over the known world to determine who was the greatest. The first competition was a 192m footrace; it was won by a cook from a nearby village. We\u2019re going back to that very first starting line.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>If I had to guess, I&#8217;d say Ohanian&#8217;s investing in pre-seed and seed startups.

And <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> finally allows for home screen widgets &#8212; a development that left Android users snickering about how &#8220;behind&#8221; their iPhone-using counterparts have been all this time.<\/p>\n<p>But as with iOS apps, Apple&#8217;s design constraints and rules around widgets mean there&#8217;s a standard that all widgets have to meet to be approved. As a result, widgets have a consistent look-and-feel, thanks to things like size limitations and other design guidelines. They can&#8217;t be stretched out indefinitely or moved all over the screen, either.<\/p>\n<p>Apple may have originally envisioned widgets as a way for existing iOS apps to gain a larger presence on users&#8217; home screens, while delivering key information like news, weather or stock updates, for example. But<a href=\"https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/creating-your-own-widgets-a-new-category-of-apps-emerges\/\"> a handful of iOS developers<\/a> instead built apps that allowed users to design widgets themselves &#8212; by selecting colors, fonts, sizes, backgrounds and what information the widget would display.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, TikTok users and other Gen Z&#8217;ers began teaching each other how to create custom icons for their apps using Apple&#8217;s Shortcuts app. These tutorials were starting to trend even before iOS 14&#8217;s release, but the addition of the App Library and widgets meant users could now <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/21\/how-to-make-the-most-of-ios-14-widgets-and-iphone-home-screen-customization\/\">finally customize their entire home screen<\/a>. That prompted a more enthusiastic adoption of the icon customization technique.<\/p>\n<p>On the Twitter hashtag #iOS14homescreen, users shared their creations &#8212; a showcase of creativity where home screens looked fully themed at last, with custom icons, widgets, decorative photos, matching wallpapers and more. <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/i\/events\/1308127358038179843?s=20\">The results have been fantastic.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>And at the top of the App Store, there now sit a trio of must-have tools for this new era: Widgetsmith, Color Widgets and Photo Widget today continue to claim the top three spots on the free apps chart.<\/p>\n<p>Users are also now demanding Apple to change how app shortcuts open. Currently, an app shortcut first launches Apple&#8217;s Shortcuts app, which then opens the target app. With the popularity of custom icons, users want that intermediate step cut out.<\/p>\n<p>Apple is aware of the customization craze as it has in the days since iOS 14&#8217;s release run App Store editorial features about iOS 14&#8217;s design changes, suggested widgets to try, creative tools and more. It also featured apps at the top of the App Store, which are benefiting from the trend, like apps offering great widgets, like Fantastical, or those that are booming, like Pinterest &#8212; which <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/22\/pinterest-breaks-daily-download-record-thanks-to-user-interest-in-ios-14-design-ideas\/\">recently broke<\/a> its daily download record.<\/p>\n<h2>App makers team up to take on Apple and Google<\/h2>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\">A number of top app makers have banded together to fight against\u00a0<a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/apple\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple\u2019s <\/a>control of its App Store and, to a lesser extent, Google\u2019s control of the Play Store \u2014 a topic of increased regulatory scrutiny in recent months. Today, 13 app publishers, including Epic Games, Deezer, Basecamp, Tile, Spotify and others, have launched the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/appfairness.org\/\">Coalition for App Fairness<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The new organization formalizes efforts the companies already have underway that focus on either forcing app store providers to change their policies, or ultimately pushing the app stores into regulation.<\/p>\n<p>On the coalition\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/appfairness.org\/\">website<\/a>, the group details its key issues, which include anti-competitive practices, like the app stores\u2019 30% commission structure, and the inability to distribute software to billions of Apple devices through any other means but the App Store, which the group sees as an affront to personal freedom.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/google\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> allows apps to be side-loaded, so it\u2019s not as much of a target on this front. In fact, much of the focus of the coalition\u2019s efforts have to do with Apple\u2019s business, given its stricter guidelines.<\/p>\n<p>The group has also published a list of 10 \u201cApp Store Principles\u201d it would like to see enacted industry-wide. These include the ability to distribute apps outside of app stores, protections from having their own data used against them to compete, timely access to developer documentation, the right to communicate with users through its app for legitimate business purposes, no requirements to use the app store\u2019s payment systems, no requirements to pay unfair fees and more.<\/p>\n<p>The website is also aiming to recruit new members to join the coalition. App makers who feel similarly oppressed by Apple\u2019s practices are able to fill out a form to request to join.<\/p>\n<p>Apple responded to the hardball tactics with a barrage of new material and data meant to highlight the benefits of its App Store platform. The company on Thursday <a href=\"https:\/\/appleinsider.com\/articles\/20\/09\/24\/app-store-rejected-150000-apps-in-2020-is-seeing-100000-submissions-per-week\">revealed the number<\/a> of rejections it enforces is quite low compared to the number of submissions. It said it rejected 150,000 apps in 2020 but sees 100,000 submissions per week. It also has removed more than 60 million user reviews it believed to be spam.<\/p>\n<p>The company noted its Developer program has over 28 million developers worldwide, whose apps have seen over 50 billion promotions &#8212; meaning when a user sees an app Apple has promoted on the App Store, in emails, on social media or in other general advertising.<\/p>\n<p>However, the backlash has also <a href=\"https:\/\/appleinsider.com\/articles\/20\/09\/24\/apple-clarifies-details-on-video-partner-program-for-developers\">forced Apple to be more transparent<\/a> about some of its until-now fairly secretive programs. For example, Apple has <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/programs\/video-partner\/\">now published a page<\/a> that clarifies how its Video Partner program works &#8212; a program that had before only been detailed via background conversations with reporters who then relayed the information to readers. The page reveals the program&#8217;s requirements and that over 130 premium subscription video entertainment providers have since joined. If the guidelines are followed, these providers can pay only a 15% commission to Apple instead of 20%.<\/p>\n<p>Current members include Amazon Prime Video, Binge, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), Claro, C More, DAZN, Disney+, Globo, HBO Max, Joyn, Molotov, MUBI, myCanal, STARZ and Viaplay, the website said.<\/p>\n<h2>TikTok deal chaos continues<\/h2>\n<p>No, seriously, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/21\/tiktok-wtf\/\">what is going on<\/a> with the TikTok deal?

In China Daily, an official English-language newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, an editorial slammed the deal that would see Oracle and Walmart effectively taking over TikTok in the U.S. as one based on &#8220;bullying and extortion.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"CAjTsJg2yG\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/20\/tiktok-fact-checks-us-ipo-chinese-ownership-5b-in-taxes\/\">TikTok fact checks: US IPO, Chinese ownership, $5B in taxes<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;TikTok fact checks: US IPO, Chinese ownership, $5B in taxes&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/20\/tiktok-fact-checks-us-ipo-chinese-ownership-5b-in-taxes\/embed\/#?secret=CAjTsJg2yG\" data-secret=\"CAjTsJg2yG\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>At the same time, TikTok is chasing a legal means of preventing its ban in the U.S.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/23\/tiktok-files-for-injunction-against-pending-trump-app-ban\/\">TikTok filed a motion<\/a> to stop the Commerce Department from enforcing the Trump administration&#8217;s ban that would otherwise be set to start this weekend. The move came shortly after WeChat users <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/20\/trump-administrations-wechat-ban-is-blocked-by-u-s-district-court\/\">were granted<\/a> an injunction in a federal court last week that blocked the app from being banned.

But unlike the WeChat case, TikTok is the one asking the court to stop the ban, not its users.<\/p>\n<p>A federal judge <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-usa-tiktok-idUSKCN26F35F\">said Thursday<\/a> that the Trump administration must either delay the ban on U.S. app stores or file its legal response to defend the decision by 2:30 PM Friday.

But iPhone home screen customization never really took off until this month, thanks to the launch of iOS 14. With the OS update, developers have finally been able to ship widgets of different sizes alongside their apps to offer a more engaging experience directly on users&#8217; home screens.<\/p>\n<p>While the original intention was focused on bringing informational updates from existing apps to the home screen, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/23\/top-20-ios-homescreen-customization-apps-reach-5-7m-installs-after-ios-14-release\/\">a handful of developers leveraged<\/a> the new capabilities to build specialized widget design tools. These widget-making apps have allowed users to create widgets of many sorts and sizes, using a variety of colors and styles. Widgetsmith, for example, has been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/23\/top-20-ios-homescreen-customization-apps-reach-5-7m-installs-after-ios-14-release\/\">topping<\/a> the App Store charts as users began to customize their home screens.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, a number of users figured out <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/21\/how-to-make-the-most-of-ios-14-widgets-and-iphone-home-screen-customization\/\">how to use Apple&#8217;s Shortcuts<\/a> to replace the icons associated with their favorite apps in order to create entirely unique, themed home screen experiences. Tutorials popped up on TikTok and the hashtag <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/ios14homescreen?src=hashtag_click\">#iOS14homescreen<\/a> began trending on Twitter as people shared the end results of their iPhone makeovers.<\/p>\n<p>But one obstacle to redesigning the home screen was that you either needed to find a set of custom icons to use or design your own using an app like PicsArt or Photoshop, for example. And this could be challenging for those who don&#8217;t regularly work with creative tools. That&#8217;s where Launch Center Pro comes in:<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" style=\"max-width: 605px; min-width: 325px;\" cite=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@launchcenterpro\/video\/6875830950123670790\" data-video-id=\"6875830950123670790\">\n<section><a title=\"@launchcenterpro\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@launchcenterpro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@launchcenterpro<\/a>Build your own custom icons for iOs 14!

redesigns Fire TV, introduces new Fire TV Stick and low-cost Fire TV Stick Lite"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/amazon\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"amazon\">Amazon <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> today announced a redesign Fire TV experience along with an updated Fire TV Stick and a new, lower-cost Fire TV Stick Lite. The updated interface for the Alexa-enabled smart TV platform will introduce a handful of new features, including support video calling and other options for using Fire TV as a way to video chat, including later, support for Zoom, Amazon says.<\/p>\n<p>It also improves the overall design of the Fire TV software experience.<\/p>\n<p>The updated Fire TV design includes a personalized home page where you can more quickly get to your favorite content and apps. It will also support the recently introduced user profiles for up to six people in a household. The profiles allow users to keep track of the shows they&#8217;re watching and see recommendations tailored to their own interests.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Fire TV&#8217;s navigation has also been simplified. Gone is the lengthy row of tabs at the top of the screen to click through. Instead, navigation has moved down the page next to your profile icon, and now includes tabs for Home, Find, Live, and Library, alongside a row of your favorite apps.<\/p>\n<p>The top of the screen, meanwhile, has been freed up to better display a large advertisement for Amazon&#8217;s own content or those from other properties. This is an understandable design choice as it gives Amazon the ability to promote its own shows, but it also takes up a large part of the screen for what may feel like an ad to some customers.<\/p>\n<p>An Alexa hub on Fire TV will help to show off what sort of things you can do with Alexa, including how you can use picture-in-picture mode to watch your smart cameras alongside your TV show. And now, when you ask Alexa a question, she won&#8217;t take over the full screen &#8212; a tweak that recalls Apple&#8217;s recent update to the Siri experience in iOS 14, perhaps.<\/p>\n<p>But the bigger is news is around how Amazon envisions the Fire TV as a communications device.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;People have been watching more and more TV at home through devices like Fire TV and we&#8217;ve sold over 100 million of them live today,&#8221; said Amazon VP, Entertainment Devices and Services, Marc Whitten. &#8220;They&#8217;re watching billions of hours of entertainment a month. And they&#8217;ve also been using them for new things &#8212; different things that they hadn&#8217;t before,&#8221; he added.<\/p>\n<p>On this front, Amazon is introducing Video Calling with Fire TV.\u00a0 The new feature will allow the home&#8217;s biggest screen to display video calls. Initially, this will work by allowing customers to connect a Logitech USB webcam with their Fire TV Cube to enable two-way video calling on Alexa. Later, Amazon will add support for Zoom, but didn&#8217;t offer a launch date.<\/p>\n<p>Though not mentioned today, it seems obvious that Amazon is likely planning to introduce new Fire TV television sets that include built-in webcams at some point further down the road. It&#8217;s unclear why it wasn&#8217;t ready to launch those today at its big event, however.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2051641\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2051641\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2051641\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/download-2-1.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"528\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/download-2-1.jpeg 1624w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/download-2-1.jpeg?resize=150,116 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/download-2-1.jpeg?resize=300,233 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/download-2-1.jpeg?resize=768,596 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/download-2-1.jpeg?resize=680,528 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/download-2-1.jpeg?resize=1536,1192 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/download-2-1.jpeg?resize=50,39 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2051641\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Amazon<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>As for Fire TV hardware, today&#8217;s announcements were limited to Fire TV Stick.<\/p>\n<p>The Fire TV Stick is one of Amazon&#8217;s best-sellers and the first product on all of Amazon.com to surpass a quarter of million in customer ratings, the company noted. It now has the most 5-star ratings of any product.<\/p>\n<p>The updated Fire TV Stick has been updated with a 50% more powerful processor, and supports HDR compatibility and Dolby Atmos support for full-HD streaming. But it will use 50% less power than its predecessor, Amazon says. It will continue to ship with the Alexa remote, which includes dedicated volume, power and mute buttons that can control your TV, soundbar and AV equipment. The device will roll out later in the year for $39.99.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon also announced a new, more affordable Fire TV Stick, called the Fire TV Stick Lite. This version, which isn&#8217;t quite as powerful as the new Fire TV Stick, supports streaming in full-HD with HDR, and comes with Alexa Voice Remote Lite.<\/p>\n<p>The Fire TV Stick Lite will start shipping later this month for $29.99.<\/p>\n<p><em>Clarification: The large promotional image at top of screen will also feature non-Amazon content.

The company is bringing a new spherical design to the Echo Dot, Echo Dot with Clock and a new Echo Dot Kids Edition &#8212; the latter which now features colorful animal character designs. Instead of a flatter, hockey puck-shaped device that can better be hidden on shelves, the updated Dot designs mean consumers will have to think more about where they&#8217;re placed in the room.<\/p>\n<p>The Dot and Dot with Clock will come in Charcoal, Glacier White, and Twilight Blue colors. The Kids Edition will now be available with either a tiger or panda design to also make them feel more like room d\u00e9cor.<\/p>\n<p>The devices will also include a 1.6-inch, front-firing speaker, producing crisp vocals and balanced bass for full sound, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/amazon\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"amazon\">Amazon <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> claims.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The actual functionality provided by the new Dot hasn&#8217;t changed as much. It still offers access to the Alexa smart assistant, music, skills, news, reminders, lists, alarms and more.<\/p>\n<p>Kids Edition devices also come with kid-friendly responses, and allow kids to listen thousands of Audible books from brands like Disney, Nickelodeon, and National Geographic, among others.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2051560\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/download-1.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"528\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/download-1.jpeg 812w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/download-1.jpeg?resize=150,116 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/download-1.jpeg?resize=300,233 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/download-1.jpeg?resize=768,596 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/download-1.jpeg?resize=680,528 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/download-1.jpeg?resize=50,39 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Another new Alexa feature, Reading Sidekick, has been designed to complement kids\u2019 reading routines, and helps them build fluency.<\/p>\n<p>When this launches, Alexa will take turns reading from a supported book with the child then listen for quality of reading. It will offer encouragement when the child is reading well and support when the child struggles, Amazon says. Reading Sidekick at launch will work with hundreds of children\u2019s books and will be available in preview for Amazon Kids+ families in the months ahead.<\/p>\n<p>In another move to cater to parents, Amazon says the Amazon Kids parental controls will be expanded to work all over the house, not just on their Echo Dot Kids Edition. Plus, parents will be able to create an Alexa voice profile for their kids.<\/p>\n<p>Once enabled, Alexa will shift to the Kids Alexa experience whenever it recognizes the child\u2019s voice\u2014on any device in the household\u2014and then provide kid-friendly responses, games, skills, music, and more. Those families who subscribe to Amazon Kids+ will have access to all the kids\u2019 favorite premium skills and Audible books, as part of that catalog.<\/p>\n<p>A preview of Alexa voice profiles for kids will begin rolling out for Amazon Kids and Amazon Kids+ families in the coming months.<\/p>\n<p>Echo Dot Kids Edition will be available for pre-order today for only $59.99 and will ship later this year.<\/p>\n<p>The Echo Dot will be available for pre-order today for $49.99 and will ship later this year.

makers band together to fight for App Store changes with new &#8216;Coalition for App Fairness&#8217;"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">A number of top app makers have banded together to fight against <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> control of its App Store and, to a lesser extent, Google&#8217;s control of the Play Store &#8212; a topic of increased regulatory scrutiny in recent months. Today, 13 app publishers, including Epic Games, Deezer, Basecamp, Tile, Spotify and others, have launched the <a href=\"https:\/\/appfairness.org\/\">Coalition for App Fairness<\/a>. The new organization formalizes efforts the companies already have underway that focus on either forcing app store providers to change their policies, or ultimately forcing the app stores into regulation.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/epic-games-2\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"epic-games-2\">Epic Games, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> for example, is currently involved in a lawsuit against Apple over the App Store&#8217;s commission guidelines. Basecamp&#8217;s launch of its Hey email app led to a public battle between the two after Apple blocked the app&#8217;s updates for its decision to not use Apple&#8217;s own in-app purchase platform. Other app makers in the group have through public statements previously spoken out against Apple&#8217;s practices, and some have also communicated their complaints to Congress.<\/p>\n<p>Included in the new group of app makers are Basecamp, Blix, Blockchain.com, Deezer, Epic Games, the European Publishers Council, Match Group, News Media Europe, Prepear, Protonmail, SkyDemon, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/spotify\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"spotify\">Spotify <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and Tile.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>On the coalition&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/appfairness.org\/\">website<\/a>, the group details its key issues, which include anti-competitive practices, like the app stores&#8217; 30% commission structure, and the inability to distribute software to billions of Apple devices through any other means but the App Store, which the group sees as an affront to personal freedom.<\/p>\n<p>Google allows apps to be side-loaded, so it&#8217;s not as much of a target on this front. In fact, much of the focus of the coalition&#8217;s efforts have to do with Apple&#8217;s business, given its stricter guidelines.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, much of Apple&#8217;s success in the app economy can be attributed to its tight controls over how apps are created, designed, reviewed and distributed. Its App Store is purged of junk and spam more often and app reviews are handled largely by humans, not automated tech. Apple app developers also have to abide by guidelines that control how their app should look and feel, what sort of content is allowed and how those apps should behave. Its rules around in-app purchases have also led to a customer experience where making purchases inside an app are as simple as pressing down your thumb or clicking a button, then looking at your phone to complete a transaction.<\/p>\n<p>On the flip side, however, Apple&#8217;s guidelines don&#8217;t offer much freedom to businesses that have no need to rely on the App Store for things like customer acquisition, search ads or the handling of payments. They may also be capable of hosting their own app and services and their own infrastructure, but have no choice but to use Apple&#8217;s platform to reach iOS customers.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;As enforcers, regulators, and legislators around the world investigate Apple for its anti-competitive behavior, The Coalition for App Fairness will be the voice of app and game developers in the effort to protect consumer choice and create a level playing field for all,&#8221; said Horacio Gutierrez, head of Global Affairs and chief legal officer at Spotify, in a statement issued by the group on Thursday.<\/p>\n<p>The group has also published a list of 10 &#8220;App Store Principles&#8221; it would like to see enacted industry-wide. These include the ability to distribute apps outside of app stores, protections from having their own data used against them to compete, timely access to developer documentation, the right to communicate with users through its app for legitimate business purposes, no requirements to use the app store&#8217;s payment systems, no requirements to pay unfair fees and more.<\/p>\n<p>The members have also <a href=\"https:\/\/appfairness.org\/app-developers-coalition-for-app-fairness-competition-innovation\/\">issued<\/a> individual statements, which are available on the group&#8217;s website and, perhaps mostly importantly, they&#8217;ve launched a mechanism to recruit new members. App makers who feel similarly oppressed by Apple&#8217;s practices are able to fill out a form to request to join.<\/p>\n<p>The organization says this represents &#8220;an open call to all developers, big and small, to join us.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Apple didn&#8217;t directly comment on the group&#8217;s launch, but it did today release new resources, including a redesign of its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/app-store\/\">About the App Store<\/a> page that details its benefits, the addition of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/app-store\/developing-for-the-app-store\/\">page<\/a> that focused specifically on developer benefits, an <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/app-store\/features\/\">overview<\/a> of the advantages provided by its app developer program and <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/programs\/video-partner\/\">a new site<\/a> that explains its Apple Video Partner program and how to apply.<\/p>\n<p>Apple tends to not be transparent about some of its programs. Instead, it tends to brief press on background when its rules change (or it say, launches new websites&#8230;), instead of issuing public statements, writing blog posts, or issuing press releases. When reached for comment over App Store issues, Apple rarely goes on record.<\/p>\n<p>But the company&#8217;s inner operations were revealed during the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/tech-antitrust-hearing\/\">recent antitrust hearings<\/a>, which brought to light how it cut a special deal with Amazon, how it determined <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/29\/apples-app-store-commission-structure-called-into-question-in-antitrust-hearing\/\">which apps to commission<\/a>\u00a0and how it handled complex decisions &#8212; like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/29\/apple-ceo-tim-cook-questioned-over-app-stores-removal-of-rival-screen-time-apps-in-antitrust-hearing\/\">banning an entire category of apps<\/a> by claiming they were now a privacy threat, instead of offering an alternative path to remain in business.<\/p>\n<p>The backlash over this behavior has been bubbling up for years and is now coming to a head thanks to the regulator investigations. Not all the companies fighting Apple are necessarily in it to save the little guy, however. Had Apple quietly cut special deals with Epic or Spotify too, you may have never heard from them about App Store abuses.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A number of top app makers have banded together to fight against Apple&#8217;s control of its App Store and, to a lesser extent, Google&#8217;s control of the Play Store &#8212; a topic of increased regulatory scrutiny in recent months.

This podcasting market is also one Spotify has heavily invested in, with its acquisitions of podcast companies, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/14\/spotify-gimlet-anchor-340-million\/\">like Gimlet<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/05\/spotify-is-buying-the-ringer-to-boost-its-sports-podcast-content\/\">The Ringer,<\/a> as well as podcasting tools that allow more people to become creators, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/06\/spotify-doubles-down-on-podcasts\/\">like Anchor.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Audio is by far the fastest-growing medium in the entertainment business, and with over 250 originals and thousands of hours of content, Spotify has one of the largest libraries of unattached IP that exists in the world today and that library is being added to daily,&#8221; said Chernin Entertainment Chairman and CEO <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/peter-chernin\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"peter-chernin\">Peter Chernin, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> in a statement. &#8220;This treasure trove of content plus the acceleration of new voices and stories provides an enormous opportunity to transform these addictive stories and IP into content for the screen,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify tells TechCrunch the deal doesn&#8217;t include any commitment to adapt a certain number of podcasts into video projects, but it believes the volume will be high. Specific deal terms were also not being disclosed, including any possible revenue-sharing details. However, the deal doesn&#8217;t prevent Spotify from working with other production companies on programs Chernin decides to pass on. It also doesn&#8217;t specify any marketing or promotional commitments. Those will be handled on a project-by-project basis, Spotify says.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify&#8217;s library of 250 original shows, as well as those it continues to release in the weeks and months ahead, will remain at the center of this agreement, but there may be scenarios where the companies also collaborate on adaptations beyond that group, Spotify tells us.<\/p>\n<p>The aim is to discover what sorts of programs translate well into movies and TV. On this front, Spotify says it believes its diversity of content, ability to analyze data and creator access will be to its advantage.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify original podcast library today includes popular shows across a variety of genres, which is a key asset in this deal. In addition, Spotify will be able to tap into data on how well shows are performing thanks to its prior development of specialized tools for analytics.<\/p>\n<p>For example, Spotify currently allows podcasters to track their own show&#8217;s performance and other anonymized audience data through the Spotify for Podcasters service. Now, the company will be able to use this same data set to help identify possible adaptations that would do well. Because Spotify also owns several of the podcast production companies, it can also help work to identify creators with vision who may be better-suited to help with larger adaptations of this nature.<\/p>\n<p>This is not the first time Spotify&#8217;s podcast content has been turned into movies or TV.

However, this free access will only be available through month-end (Sept. 30).<\/p>\n<p>To get started with a Watch Party, users should look for the new Watch Party icon on supported content.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Currently, Watch Party requires the Google Chrome web browser on a desktop or laptop computer in order to work. After clicking to start the Watch Party, users will sign into their Sling TV account if they hadn&#8217;t already, then send out an invite link that allows friends and family to join the Watch Party session. Sling TV will provide a built-in tool to quickly email the link or you can copy the link and distribute in other ways &#8212; like a preferred messaging app, for example.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2051061\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2051061\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2051061\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/UT-Football_laptop-full-UI-with-chat-beta-badge.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"421\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/UT-Football_laptop-full-UI-with-chat-beta-badge.png 3528w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/UT-Football_laptop-full-UI-with-chat-beta-badge.png?resize=150,93 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/UT-Football_laptop-full-UI-with-chat-beta-badge.png?resize=300,186 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/UT-Football_laptop-full-UI-with-chat-beta-badge.png?resize=768,475 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/UT-Football_laptop-full-UI-with-chat-beta-badge.png?resize=680,421 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/UT-Football_laptop-full-UI-with-chat-beta-badge.png?resize=1536,951 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/UT-Football_laptop-full-UI-with-chat-beta-badge.png?resize=2048,1268 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/UT-Football_laptop-full-UI-with-chat-beta-badge.png?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2051061\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Sling TV<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>At launch, Watch Party-enabled content can be viewed by 4 total participants at the same time. It&#8217;s also not available across all of Sling TV&#8217;s online library or live programming. Instead, the company says that it works on &#8220;most&#8221; live, On Demand and Lookback content, but not local channels like NBC and FOX, rentals, Pay-per-view events, Premium or standalone channels, or programming saved on the Cloud DVR. Standard regional blackouts will also apply.<\/p>\n<p>The feature is supported across Sling TV plans, including its domestic base service (Sling Orange and\/or Sling Blue), Sling Latino, Sling International or any Sling TV Extra, depending on subscription.<\/p>\n<p>That means users can co-watch content from channels like TNT, TBS, AMC, CNN, A&amp;E, History, IFC, BBC America, TruTV, and others. Sling TV suggests the feature would be great for co-watching the NBA Western Conference Finals Game 4 or <em>Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back<\/em> on TNT, <em>The Walking Dead<\/em> on AMC, <em>American Pickers<\/em> on History, or the first presidential debate on CNN, for example.<\/p>\n<p>During the Watch Party session, the content will live stream in the middle of the screen while text chat sits off to one side of the screen (where it can be optionally hidden) and video chat is on the other. Sling TV recommends all users wear headphones for the best experience. Individuals will also be able to control what volume at which they hear each guest separately from the show itself by hovering over a friend&#8217;s video and adjusting their audio bar.<\/p>\n<p>Customers can only host one Watch Party at a time, but there&#8217;s no limitation on how often the feature can be used otherwise.<\/p>\n<p>Several streaming services and video chat applications have rolled out co-viewing experiences in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, which has limited real-world gatherings. In addition to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/28\/hulu-launches-a-new-watch-party-feature-for-virtual-viewing-parties-and-chat\/\">Hulu<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/29\/amazon-prime-video-introduces-watch-party-a-social-coviewing-experience-included-with-prime\/\">Amazon Video<\/a>, users are co-watching Netflix with an unofficial extension, Netflix Party, and co-watching on <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/28\/plex-launches-a-co-watching-experience-for-its-on-demand-library-and-users-personal-media\/\">Plex<\/a>. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/14\/scener-now-lets-you-co-watch-hbo-or-netflix-in-a-virtual-theater-with-up-to-20-people\/\">HBO is working with Scener<\/a> to support virtual theater experiences and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/facebook-introduces-a-co-viewing-experience-in-messenger-watch-together\/\">Facebook just launched co-watching within Messenger,<\/a> too.<\/p>\n<p>For Sling TV, the feature&#8217;s launch may also be tied to hopes of stemming subscriber losses. The company in February posted its <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/19\/sling-tv-reports-first-ever-subscriber-decline\/\">first-ever subscriber decline<\/a> as streaming competition heated up. It then <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lightreading.com\/services\/dish-sheds-40000-satellite-tv-subs-56000-sling-tv-subs-in-q2\/d\/d-id\/763043\">shed<\/a> 56,000 more subscribers in Q2 as the pandemic took its toll. With the support for temporary guest access, Sling TV may be hoping to convert some new subscribers, as well. But the feature is being offered for such a brief period that users may not have time to make co-viewing the sort habit they later decide to pay for, and instead use it for a one-off co-viewing session of sorts.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Live TV streaming service Sling TV is joining in on the co-watching trend.

According to new data from app store market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, installs of the top 20 home screen customization apps reached 5.7 million total downloads worldwide in the first four days following <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/ios-14-is-now-available-to-download\/\">the release of iOS 14<\/a> on September 16.<\/p>\n<p>[<strong>Update<\/strong>: While the original estimates focused on Sept. 17-20, the figures were calculated again in the days that followed. Sensor Tower then updated its report with the latest figures from September 17 to September 23. In the seven days following iOS 14&#8217;s launch, the top 20 home screen customization apps reached at least 13.7 million installs and more than $1 million in consumer spending from the App Store globally, it estimates. Widgetsmith, Color Widgets, and Photo Widget remained the top three apps, collectively generating more than 12.6 million installs in that period.]<\/p>\n<p><em>Original article follows:\u00a0<\/em><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Remarkably, the three most-downloaded apps &#8212; Widgetsmith, Color Widgets and Photo Widget &#8212; account for 95% of these 5.7 million downloads. That indicates that the rest of the app customization market today is much smaller. But this could still change over time if more apps embrace the trend and expand to include innovative and unique features.<\/p>\n<p>Sensor Tower&#8217;s study on the home screen customization market only focused on those apps that were used to create home screen widgets or existed primarily to service them, like calendars, clocks, memos and others.<\/p>\n<p>To determine if the app offered home screen customization tools, Sensor Tower analyzed the app metadata of all the apps that ranked at any point on the App Store after September 16, then manually reviewed those apps to confirm their functionality was home-screen-customization related.<\/p>\n<p>The report&#8217;s focus was also more on widget apps, rather than apps that helped users make custom icons or existing apps that added widget functionality, as Sensor Tower decided it wouldn&#8217;t be able to determine how many had done so based on their metadata. It&#8217;s also difficult to determine, in some cases, if an app with a larger purpose beyond widgets is moving up the charts simply because it has now added widgets.<\/p>\n<p>The top 20 list, in order, includes the following:<\/p>\n<p>Widgetsmith, Color Widgets, Photo Widget, Photobox Widget, MemoWidget, Home Photo Widget, Motivation Widget, Ermine, Date Today, Hey Weather, TimeDeck, Widgeridoo, Glimpse 2, Widget Wizard, Widget Web, Locket, ItemMemo, OMDZ, Clock Widget for Home Screen and Photo Widgets.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2050947\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2050947\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2050947\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/home-screen-customization-apps-downloads.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"412\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/home-screen-customization-apps-downloads.png 1560w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/home-screen-customization-apps-downloads.png?resize=150,91 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/home-screen-customization-apps-downloads.png?resize=300,182 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/home-screen-customization-apps-downloads.png?resize=768,465 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/home-screen-customization-apps-downloads.png?resize=680,412 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/home-screen-customization-apps-downloads.png?resize=1536,930 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/home-screen-customization-apps-downloads.png?resize=50,30 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2050947\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Sensor Tower<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Combined, the group has generated a collective $400,000 in consumer spending in four days &#8212; from September 17 through September 20. Widgetsmith dominated the group, accounting for $370,000 of that total, followed by an app called Date Today with close to $20,000, per Sensor Tower estimates. (We should note Widgetsmith&#8217;s figure comes in a bit lower than some of the other estimates that were <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/rjonesy\/status\/1308223993443504129\">floating around<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>Though Sensor Tower&#8217;s study had a narrower focus, there are signals that plenty of apps have benefitted from the customization craze beyond the widget makers themselves.<\/p>\n<p>Design inspiration resource Pinterest, as noted above, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/22\/pinterest-breaks-daily-download-record-thanks-to-user-interest-in-ios-14-design-ideas\/\">saw<\/a> record daily downloads. TuneTrack, now the No. 18 free (nongame) app on the U.S. App Store appears to be gathering steam in the absence of an official Spotify widget. Its app offers both Apple Music and Spotify widgets for showing off favorite music on your home screen.<\/p>\n<p>Sensor Tower says TuneTrack saw 552,000 installs between Sept. 17 and 20, for example &#8212; a figure up 1,840% from the prior week (9\/10-9\/13). The Motivation widget saw 431,000 installs, up 798%.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, design tool Procreate Pocket is now the No. 2 paid (nongame) app in the U.S., and PicsArt is the No. 31 free app. An app that simplifies icon changing, Icon Changer+, is No. 40 on the Top Free Apps charts in the U.S., followed by an app called Shortcuts, which is <em>not<\/em> the same Shortcuts app from <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>.

This makes it more difficult for a consumer who wants to compare the rankings of all top apps offering home screen customization functionality in one place.<\/p>\n<p>Given that iOS 14 has effectively created an entire new category of apps, it&#8217;s possible that Apple would consider adding a customization category to the App Store in the future, if the trend continues long term.<\/p>\n<p>For now, however, Apple is addressing the discoverability issues with new App Store editorial content. A featured story on the App Store&#8217;s &#8220;Today&#8221; page, for example, is titled &#8220;How to Set Up Widgets,&#8221; and recommends a number of apps that have added widgets &#8212; like Todoist, Carrot Weather, Timepage, Apollo, Spark Mail and others, in addition to Widgetsmith.<\/p>\n<p>There are new widgets still arriving, as well, as developers roll out their iOS 14 updates. Fantastical, for example, <a href=\"https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2020\/09\/23\/fantastical-ios-14-home-screen-widgets\/\">just launched 12 home screen widgets<\/a> today.<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s unfortunate is that Apple didn&#8217;t give its developer community enough time to prepare for launch day. The company announced iOS 14&#8217;s release <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/apple-burns-developer-goodwill-with-surprise-release-of-ios-14\/\">with less than 24 hours&#8217; notice<\/a> and without the final version of Xcode available to developers. As a result, when users began to customize their home screens, they may not have found all the widgets they would have wanted.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The iOS 14 home screen customization trend is driving a new set of apps to the top of the App Store charts, and delivering record downloads for sources of inspiration, like Pinterest.

But its app also allows videos up to a minute in length, which is a popular option. Reels, however, launched with support for only the 15-second video. Not surprisingly, the Reels community of early adopters has been asking for the ability to create longer videos, similar to TikTok.<\/p>\n<p>But Instagram isn&#8217;t giving them the full one minute. Instead, it&#8217;s adding the ability to create a Reel up to 30 seconds long. This could force users to create original content for Reels, instead of repurposing their longer TikTok videos on Instagram.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2050769\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2050769\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2050769\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Reels-Trim.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"431\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Reels-Trim.png 1616w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Reels-Trim.png?resize=150,95 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Reels-Trim.png?resize=300,190 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Reels-Trim.png?resize=768,487 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Reels-Trim.png?resize=680,431 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Reels-Trim.png?resize=1536,973 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Reels-Trim.png?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2050769\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Instagram<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The company says it will also now allow users to extend the timer up to 10 seconds and will allow users to trim and delete clips to make editing simpler.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We continue to improve Reels based on people\u2019s feedback, and these updates make it easier to create and edit. While it\u2019s still early, we\u2019re seeing a lot of entertaining, creative content,&#8221; said Instagram Reels Director, Tessa Lyons-Laing.<\/p>\n<p>The tweaks to the video creation and editing process could help to simplify some of the more troublesome pain points, but don&#8217;t fully address the problems facing Reels.<\/p>\n<p>What makes TikTok so easy to use is that you don&#8217;t have to be a great video editor to make what appear to be fairly polished, short-form videos synced to music. With TikTok&#8217;s Sound Sync feature, for example, the app can automatically find music that synchronizes with your video clips, if you don&#8217;t want to take full control of the editing experience.<\/p>\n<p>On Reels, there&#8217;s more manual editing involved in terms of locating the right music and matching it up with your edits &#8212; which you have to do yourself, instead of leaving it up to the tech to do for you.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2050768\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2050768\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2050768\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Reels-Timer.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"431\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Reels-Timer.png 1616w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Reels-Timer.png?resize=150,95 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Reels-Timer.png?resize=300,190 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Reels-Timer.png?resize=768,487 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Reels-Timer.png?resize=680,431 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Reels-Timer.png?resize=1536,973 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Reels-Timer.png?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2050768\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Instagram<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Despite being a shameless attempt at being a TikTok clone, Reels lacks other TikTok features, like duets or <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/16\/tiktok-to-launch-parental-controls-globally-disable-direct-messaging-for-users-under-16\/\">its &#8220;Family Pairing&#8221; parental controls<\/a>. It also makes it difficult to figure out how to share videos more privately. Reels can be posted to Stories, where they disappear, or they can appear on your profile in their own tab &#8212; which is a confusing design choice. Plus, the integration of Reels in the Instagram app<a href=\"https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/instagram-reels-tiktok-rival-164624402.html\">\u00a0contributes to app bloat<\/a>. TikTok is an entire social network, but Reels is trying to squeeze that broader creative experience into a much smaller box alongside so many other features, like Stories, Shopping, Live Video, IGTV and more standard photo and video publishing. It feels like too much.<\/p>\n<p>That said, Reels has managed to onboard a number of high-profile users.

is introducing a new feature designed to make podcasts more interactive. The company says it&#8217;s beginning to test &#8220;Polls,&#8221; a tool that will allow listeners to engage with podcasts by answering questions posed by the podcast hosts during the show. The polls will appear in the Spotify app, and can be found either on the Now Playing screen or on the podcast episode&#8217;s page.<\/p>\n<p>The user can then answer the question and view how their answer stacks up with the rest of the listener base in real time.

For example, a host could ask the audience to vote on who the next guest should be, or they could ask them to settle a debate that cropped up on the show. Polls will also be able to support either a &#8220;choose one&#8221; or &#8220;choose multiple&#8221; option for the answers, to give them some flexibility.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2050725\" style=\"width: 230px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2050725\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical size-large wp-image-2050725\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Poll_NPV.png?w=220\" alt=\"\" width=\"220\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Poll_NPV.png 750w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Poll_NPV.png?resize=49,150 49w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Poll_NPV.png?resize=97,300 97w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Poll_NPV.png?resize=220,680 220w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Poll_NPV.png?resize=497,1536 497w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Poll_NPV.png?resize=663,2048 663w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Poll_NPV.png?resize=16,50 16w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2050725\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Spotify<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Podcasts that support polls will only be able to feature one per episode, and each poll can only pose one question.

(Or, at least, this was the most since January 2014, which is when Sensor Tower began tracking app download data.)<\/p>\n<p>On September 20, the firm estimates that Pinterest&#8217;s app generated around 800,000 installs across iOS and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/android\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"android\">Android <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> on a global basis.\u00a0That represents 32% week-over-week growth from the 607,000 installs it saw on September 13 &#8212; a few days before the worldwide <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/ios-14-is-now-available-to-download\/\">release of Apple&#8217;s new mobile operating system, iOS 14<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Pinterest swiftly climbed up from No. 47 on the top free iPhone charts in the U.S. on Friday, September 18 to No. 7 on Sunday, September 20. It then climbed up even further to No. 6 on Monday, September 21 &#8212; a figure that agrees with <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/apptopia\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apptopia\">Apptopia&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> data. The app may have briefly hit the No. 1 position, as well, but not long enough to be recorded as the No. 1 app for the day.<\/p>\n<p>Pinterest is also now No. 1 in the Lifestyle category on the iPhone, though it has regularly taken either a No. 1 or No. 2 position in this category as of February 4, 2020, Sensor Tower also noted.<\/p>\n<p>The Pinterest home page today showcases iPhone design trends as one of its &#8220;Daily Inspirations,&#8221; where the collection &#8220;Trending wallpapers and aesthetic homescreen ideas&#8221; is currently sitting at the top of the page. Here, users are finding iPhone backgrounds and sharing other custom designs and icon sets for people to use in their own creations.<\/p>\n<p>The iOS 14 update has had a large impact on the app ecosystem, as it finally delivered a feature Android users have had for years: home screen widgets.<\/p>\n<p>In combination with the new iOS App Library that lets you hide away less frequently used apps, the iOS update has managed to tap into what was clearly pent-up consumer demand for being able to personalize the iPhone interface to their own tastes and interests. Also, iPhone users are now taking advantage of <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Shortcuts app to create custom icons &#8212; although this is more of a hack, as the process isn&#8217;t really replacing the icon itself, but rather creating a shortcut to launch the app instead.<\/p>\n<p>This redesign trend hasn&#8217;t only impacted Pinterest.\u00a0User demand for new widgets and creative tools is now playing out across the iPhone App Store and its Top Charts.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Okay but with the new ios release I can finally utilize my dnd pinterest boards.

Meanwhile, an app called Tune Track, an early adopter of widgets, has now found itself in the No. 8 position, as well.\u00a0Even the Top Paid Charts are feeling the influence, as a Photo Widget is No. 1 and the creative design tool Procreate Pocket is No. 2.<\/p>\n<p>Whether design tools will continue to reign remains to be seen. Some people are frustrated by the way Shortcuts are launched &#8212; it first redirects to the Shortcuts app, then launches the app in question.

discovery network IRL raises $16M Series B after refocusing on virtual events"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the way a number of companies have had to do business. For the event discovery startup, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irl.com\/\">IRL<\/a>, it meant pivoting into the virtual events space. This April, the startup quickly reacted to government lockdowns and restrictions on in-person gatherings <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/02\/streaming-events-calendar\/\">to focus on helping people find their online counterparts<\/a> and other virtual events, like live-streamed concerts, Zoom parties, esports tournaments and more. Today, those efforts are paying off as IRL announces $16 million in Series B funding and the expansion of its social calendaring app to colleges.<\/p>\n<p>The new round was led by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/goodwater-capital\">Goodwater Capital<\/a> with participation from Founders Fund, Floodgate and Raine, and comes on top of the $11 million IRL had previously raised, including <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/06\/13\/irl-calendar\/\">its $8 million Series A<\/a> last year.<\/p>\n<p>The coronavirus pandemic, surprisingly, may have made <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/irl-app\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"irl-app\">IRL <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> relevant to a wider audience. Before, IRL was mostly useful to those who lived in areas where there were a lot of events to attend, or who could afford to travel. But with the refocusing on &#8220;remote life&#8221; instead of &#8220;real life,&#8221; more people could launch the app to find something interesting to do &#8212; even if it was only online.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;During the pandemic, IRL actually saw an increase in users after embracing virtual events,&#8221; explains IRL founder and CEO Abraham Shafi. &#8220;IRL is an events social network and we understand that an event doesn\u2019t need to be physical. An event is anything with a date, time and location. So this also includes things like YouTube events, Twitch streams, new music drops, astrological events in the sky and much more,&#8221; he continues.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Once COVID-19 hit and people\u2019s schedules essentially went out the window, we saw an increase in users spending time together through these kinds of events. Now more than ever, people are searching for things to do and people to do them with as they try to orient themselves in this new world,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p>In fitting with its new focus, IRL redesigned its app earlier this year to create a new home screen experience where users could discover events they could attend remotely. This design continues to be tweaked, and now features a colorful &#8220;discover&#8221; tab in the app where you can tap into various event categories, like gaming, music, tv, wellness, sports, podcasts, lifestyle and more, including those sourced from partners like <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tiktok\">TikTok, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Meetup, Twitch, Spotify, SoundCloud, HBO, Ticketmaster, Eventbrite and others.<\/p>\n<p>There are also dedicated sections for events you&#8217;re following and a curated Top Picks. The IRL in-app calendar, meanwhile, lets you easily see what&#8217;s happening today and in the weeks and months ahead.<\/p>\n<p>Since its refocusing on virtual events, IRL has brought people together for online happenings like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irl.com\/burningman\">Burning Man&#8217;s Multiverse<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irl.com\/the-weeknd-experience-tik-tok-live\/4SDjD84F\">TikTok Live&#8217;s The Weekend Experience<\/a>, for example.<\/p>\n<p>According to TikTok, IRL had helped it gauge early interest in its The Weekend Experience event, with some 52,000 IRL RSVPs and 1.1 million followers on its IRL profile.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2050099\" style=\"width: 324px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2050099\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical size-large wp-image-2050099\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/IMG_5309.png?w=314\" alt=\"\" width=\"314\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/IMG_5309.png 1125w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/IMG_5309.png?resize=69,150 69w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/IMG_5309.png?resize=139,300 139w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/IMG_5309.png?resize=768,1663 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/IMG_5309.png?resize=314,680 314w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/IMG_5309.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/IMG_5309.png?resize=946,2048 946w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/IMG_5309.png?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2050099\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> IRL screenshot via TechCrunch<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;IRL has been an amazing platform for us to engage with more of our audience and meet new potential users,&#8221; said Jenny Zhu, head of Integrated Marketing U.S. at TikTok. She also added that TikTok sees &#8220;major traffic coming from IRL&#8221; and is &#8220;excited to continue our partnership.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In terms of growth, IRL claims its users are now tracking over 1 million hours per day spent in &#8220;Time Together&#8221; &#8212; a metric that tabulates the number of hours users are spending together at the events they RSVP&#8217;d to, virtual or otherwise. In addition, IRL says it has seen 10x growth in daily active users and a total of 300 million &#8220;Time Together&#8221; hours since last June. It also claims 5.5 million MAUs.<\/p>\n<p>While IRL doesn&#8217;t share its download figures, app store intelligence firm Sensor Tower estimates the app has seen a total of 7.7 million installs across iOS and Android.<\/p>\n<p>With the additional capital, IRL is expanding with the launch of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irl.com\/edu\">college network<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Its goal is to improve upon the <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/facebook\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"facebook\">Facebook <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> experience for the younger, student demographic by helping college users find, share and attend academic and social events, both physical and virtual. However, just this month <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/10\/facebook-returns-to-its-roots-with-campus-a-college-student-only-social-network\/\">Facebook launched its own college network, Facebook Campus<\/a>, which allows students to privately network and track student events on the Facebook platform, outside of their main Facebook profile.<\/p>\n<p>IRL says it&#8217;s starting its college network with 100 colleges and universities across North America, including Harvard, Columbia and NYU. Facebook Campus, meanwhile, launched with 30 schools. In addition, Shafi says Facebook Campus doesn&#8217;t really focus on being a vertical network oriented around the event calendar &#8212; it&#8217;s a myriad of tools.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;IRL is the only social platform that helps users find the best ways to spend their time and actually encourages them to get off the platform,&#8221; says Shafi about the launch of the new network. &#8220;Colleges and universities, in particular, need a way to build and foster a sense of community, whether their students are away from campus remote learning or on campus practicing hybrid learning,&#8221; he explains.<\/p>\n<p>For IRL&#8217;s investor, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/chi-hua-chien\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"chi-hua-chien\">Chi-Hua Chien, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> a managing partner at Goodwater Capital, the potential in IRL is its focus on real connections and community building.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We believe IRL will grow to become one of the major social networks powering communities on the internet and in the real world,&#8221; Chien said. &#8220;IRL delivers on the promise to make social media less isolating, by helping drive authentic connection between friends and family around events they care about,&#8221; he added.<\/p>\n<p>Longer-term, the company sees the potential in continuing to connect users to the wider online community of events even after the pandemic has passed. And as users continue to connect to events through IRL, the company aims to make money by getting people off its app instead of keeping them in the app to show them ads, Shafi says.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;IRL cares about time together. When users spend more time together they create more driving actions, like going to the movies or to dinner, which have a high monetizable intent &#8211; especially for groups. With &#8216;Time Together,&#8217; we make money as users are successful at attending events or get value out of using IRL.

href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/technology\/area-120\/tables\/\">introducing<\/a> a new work-tracking tool, <a href=\"https:\/\/tables.area120.google.com\/about\">Tables<\/a>, which aims to make tracking projects more efficient by investing in automation. Instead of simply tracking notes and tasks associated with a project in various documents that have to be manually updated by team members, Tables&#8217; bots help do things like scheduling recurring email reminders when tasks are overdue, messaging a chat room when new form submissions are received, moving tasks to other people&#8217;s work queues or updating tasks when statuses are changed.<\/p>\n<p>The solution is designed to be useful across a number of use cases, including project management, IT operations, customer tracking and CRM, recruiting, product development and more.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been in the technology industry for a long time, including 10 years at Google,&#8221; explains Tables&#8217; GM Tim Gleason, in an announcement about the new service. &#8220;And during my years in the workforce, I\u2019ve always had a difficult time tracking projects. Our teams stored notes and related tasks in different documents. Those documents always got out of date. We\u2019d have to manually sync data between them.

The tool, however, is made to work with existing Google technology. That makes it a better choice for those who are already invested in using Google&#8217;s ecosystem, like Google&#8217;s online documents, contacts and more.<\/p>\n<p>To get started with Tables, you can import data from Google Sheets (or a .CSV), share data with your Google Groups, and assign tasks to people found in your Google Contacts. You can also get started with one of the included templates, if you prefer.<\/p>\n<p>The bots handle automated actions, while the data itself can be presented in different ways, like grid views, record lists, kanban boards and maps. Forms allow you to collect data on the fly, without having to give people access to your tables directly.<\/p>\n<p>Ahead of its public debut, Tables has been in testing with thousands of active users who are tracking work and collaborating with team members, Google says.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2049988\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2049988\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2049988\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/project-task-mgmt.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"505\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/project-task-mgmt.png 3232w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/project-task-mgmt.png?resize=150,111 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/project-task-mgmt.png?resize=300,223 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/project-task-mgmt.png?resize=768,570 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/project-task-mgmt.png?resize=680,505 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/project-task-mgmt.png?resize=1536,1141 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/project-task-mgmt.png?resize=2048,1521 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/project-task-mgmt.png?resize=50,37 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2049988\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Google<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Tables is also one of a handful of Area 120 projects to launch with <a href=\"https:\/\/tables.area120.google.com\/u\/0\/about#\/#pricing\">a paid business model.<\/a> Today, other Area 120 projects like ticket seller Fundo, conversational ads platform AdLingo and Google&#8217;s recently launched Orion WiFi also have paid models.

The paid plan, meanwhile, costs $10 per user per month, and supports up to 1,000 tables and 10,000 rows. This plan also includes support for larger attachments, more actions and advanced history, sharing, forms, automation and views.<\/p>\n<p>The project is clearly meant to tap into the growing interest in no-code, spreadsheet-powered database platforms.

In the years since, the app served as the launchpad for common tasks &#8212; like messaging a favorite contact, calling home, getting directions, playing your favorite music and much more right from the Today View.<\/p>\n<p>Now you can do the same from your home screen, but with a more customizable experience that matches your current iOS 14 theme.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2049637\" style=\"width: 324px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2049637\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical size-large wp-image-2049637\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/launcher5_6.jpg?w=314\" alt=\"\" width=\"314\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/launcher5_6.jpg 1125w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/launcher5_6.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/launcher5_6.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/launcher5_6.jpg?resize=768,1663 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/launcher5_6.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/launcher5_6.jpg?resize=709,1536 709w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/launcher5_6.jpg?resize=946,2048 946w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/launcher5_6.jpg?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2049637\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Cromulent Labs<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Apple wasn&#8217;t quite sure what to think of <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/launcher\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"launcher\">Launcher <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> back in 2014.<\/p>\n<p>The app had\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2014\/09\/22\/launcher-adds-shortcuts-to-favorite-apps-and-common-actions-to-ios-8s-notification-center\/?_ga=2.98943006.1260621666.1600694536-508606782.1595599686\">once been banned<\/a> from the App Store for several months because its sole reason for existence was to be a Today View widget provider, without offering other functionality beyond widget configuration.

Meanwhile, users are leveraging Shortcuts to create custom icons, then <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/21\/how-to-make-the-most-of-ios-14-widgets-and-iphone-home-screen-customization\/\">building creative home screen themes<\/a> using a custom combination of widgets, icons and wallpapers.<\/p>\n<p>Launcher, however, offers a simpler alternative for those who don&#8217;t want to spend hours creating a customized experience.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, you can create a widget with favorite apps and tasks, change the widget&#8217;s background color and adjust the icons&#8217; size in one go.<\/p>\n<p>For example, you can now create Launcher widgets that let you tap an icon to immediately call, message, FaceTime or email a favorite contact; get directions to a location; start playing an artist, album or playlist in Apple Music; access a favorite website; launch actions within apps (like Compose Tweet or Run Shortcut); turn common phone settings on or off (like WiFi, Bluetooth, Low Power Mode, DND, Airplane mode, etc.); or launch any other app on your device.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2049640\" style=\"width: 324px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2049640\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical size-large wp-image-2049640\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/launcher5_4.jpg?w=314\" alt=\"\" width=\"314\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/launcher5_4.jpg 1125w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/launcher5_4.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/launcher5_4.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/launcher5_4.jpg?resize=768,1663 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/launcher5_4.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/launcher5_4.jpg?resize=709,1536 709w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/launcher5_4.jpg?resize=946,2048 946w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/launcher5_4.jpg?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2049640\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits: <\/strong>Cromulent Labs<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Launcher aims to tap into the growing iOS 14 home screen customization trend as its app lets you customize the icons and widget background, even allowing for tiny icons within the widget or removing icon labels. (See above). The widget&#8217;s background can be styled to match the existing wallpaper or can be configured using images.<\/p>\n<p>Widgets can also be stacked for better space utilization and the icons they contain can change based on the day of the week, time of day or your location. That way, you could have a widget that shows up only when you hit the gym, for example, or one that appears when you&#8217;re in the office. Your home screen widget could also be different during the work week than on the weekend.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2049641\" style=\"width: 324px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2049641\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical size-large wp-image-2049641\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/launcher5_2.jpg?w=314\" alt=\"\" width=\"314\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/launcher5_2.jpg 828w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/launcher5_2.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/launcher5_2.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/launcher5_2.jpg?resize=768,1662 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/launcher5_2.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/launcher5_2.jpg?resize=710,1536 710w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/launcher5_2.jpg?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2049641\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Cromulent Labs<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Many of the app&#8217;s features were previously offered in the classic Today View widgets, but the home screen widgets work differently. Where before, you were limited to a fixed number of widgets that could be shown or hidden based on time or location, the new widgets support different icon sets that appear at different times. However, you can&#8217;t configure a home screen widget to automatically disappear as that would cause the home screen itself to rearrange.<\/p>\n<p>Launcher&#8217;s creator, Greg Gardner, says he&#8217;s seen a surge of interest in his app due to the iOS 14 release, even before its update, out today, which delivers the iOS 14 widget support.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2049642\" style=\"width: 324px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2049642\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical size-large wp-image-2049642\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/launcher5_1.jpg?w=314\" alt=\"\" width=\"314\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/launcher5_1.jpg 828w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/launcher5_1.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/launcher5_1.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/launcher5_1.jpg?resize=768,1662 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/launcher5_1.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/launcher5_1.jpg?resize=710,1536 710w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/launcher5_1.jpg?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2049642\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Cromulent Labs<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;People on iOS 14 seem to be pretty excited about home screen widgets, so they are searching the App Store for widgets and are finding my app. Unfortunately some of them have been disappointed that the app didn&#8217;t have home screen widgets,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I hope that now that it has home screen widgets the downloads will continue to increase and the new users won&#8217;t be disappointed any longer,&#8221; Gardner adds.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/apple-burns-developer-goodwill-with-surprise-release-of-ios-14\/\">surprise release of iOS 14<\/a> probably didn&#8217;t help things on this front. Apple gave its developers less than 24 hours notice of iOS 14&#8217;s arrival this year, even making its announcement before the necessary developer tools (e.g., Xcode) were available for download. That means some developers&#8217; iOS 14-compatible apps weren&#8217;t ready and available on the iOS launch day, as in years past.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the expanded functionality, there&#8217;s another reason to appreciate Launcher&#8217;s new app: Its business model.<\/p>\n<p>The app doesn&#8217;t monetize by way of subscriptions but instead only charges its users a one-time fee for an expanded feature set. While the earlier version of the app had offered two different pricing tiers, Launcher 5 has simplified pricing to just the one.<\/p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 886px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');<\/script><![endif]-->\n<video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-2049600-1\" width=\"886\" height=\"1920\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video\/mp4\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Launcher5-AppPreview1.mp4?_=1\" \/><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Launcher5-AppPreview1.mp4\">https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Launcher5-AppPreview1.mp4<\/a><\/video><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Its new &#8220;Premium&#8221; in-app purchase will unlock all the new home screen widgets and customization options. However, existing users only have to pay $2.99 for the upgrade while new users will pay the full price of $7.99.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The amount of work required to implement the new widgets was enough that I thought it justified a new in-app purchase,&#8221; says Gardner. Plus, he notes, the App Store also doesn&#8217;t offer any official means of charging upgrade pricing for scenarios like this.<\/p>\n<p>Launcher 5 is rolling out <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/app\/apple-store\/id905099592\">now on the App Store<\/a>.

grocery to multiplatform gaming to streaming services and more. But one industry that has not benefited is traditional pay TV. According to new research from eMarketer, the cable, satellite and telecom TV industry is on track to lose the most subscribers ever. This year, over 6 million U.S. households will cut the cord with pay TV, bringing the total number of cord-cutter households to 31.2 million.<\/p>\n<p>The firm says that by 2024, the number will grow even further, reaching 46.6 million total cord-cutter households, or more than a third of all U.S. households that no longer have pay TV.<\/p>\n<p>Despite these significant declines, there are still more households that have a pay TV subscription than those that do not. Today, there are 77.6 million U.S. households that have cable, satellite or telecom TV packages. But that number has declined 7.5% year-over-year &#8212; its biggest-ever drop. The figure is also down from pay TV&#8217;s peak in 2014, the analysts said.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2049586\" style=\"width: 686px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2049586\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2049586\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1-1.jpg?w=676\" alt=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1-1.jpg 922w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=298,300 298w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=768,773 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=676,680 676w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=128,128 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2049586\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> eMarketer<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The pay TV losses, as you may expect, are due to the growing adoption of streaming services. But if anything, the pandemic has pushed forward the cord-cutting movement&#8217;s momentum as the health crisis contributed to a down economy and the loss of live sports during the first part of the year. These trends may have also encouraged more consumers to cut the cord than would have otherwise.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Consumers are choosing to cut the cord because of high prices, especially compared with streaming alternatives,&#8221; said eMarketer forecasting analyst at Insider Intelligence Eric Haggstrom. &#8220;The loss of live sports in H1 2020 contributed to further declines. While sports have returned, people will not return to their old cable or satellite plans,&#8221; he added.<\/p>\n<p>Pay TV providers have been attempting to mitigate their losses by shifting their focus to more profitable internet packages, which help power the services that consumers are turning to, like <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/netflix\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"netflix\">Netflix <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and Hulu.<\/p>\n<p>Related to the pay TV decline, the loss in TV viewership is also impacting the advertising industry.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2049584\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2049584\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2049584 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"605\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1.png 1280w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1.png?resize=150,133 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1.png?resize=300,267 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1.png?resize=768,683 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1.png?resize=680,605 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1.png?resize=50,44 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2049584\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> eMarketer<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Total TV ad spend will drop 15% in 2020 to $60 billion &#8212; the lowest-ever figure the industry has since since 2011.<\/p>\n<p>Some of this is pandemic-related, however, so TV ad dollars are expected to rebound some in 2021.

today is <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2020\/09\/helping-creators-and-publishers-manage-their-intellectual-property\/\">introducing<\/a> a new tool that will allow rights holders to protect and manage their photos across both Facebook and Instagram. With the newly launched &#8220;Rights Manager for Images,&#8221; Facebook is offering creators and publishers access to content-matching technology similar to what it introduced in 2016 to combat stolen videos. The new feature, which is available in Facebook&#8217;s Creator Studio, will allow rights owners to assert control over their intellectual property across Facebook and Instagram, including when the image is embedded on an external website.<\/p>\n<p>As with Facebook&#8217;s existing Rights Manager for video content, creators who want to assert their control over their images will have to provide Facebook with a copy of the images they want to protect, as well as a CSV file with image metadata, as a first step. These are uploaded to a reference library that Rights Manager uses to locate matches across both Facebook and Instagram.<\/p>\n<p>The creator doesn&#8217;t have to publicly post their images on Facebook or Instagram for this process to work.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>When matching content is found on a Page or a profile, the rights holder can choose whether to simply monitor the content, block its use through a takedown request or attribute credit to themselves via an ownership link. Creators can also choose whether or not they want their ownership to apply worldwide or only in certain geographic locations.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2049479\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2049479\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2049479\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/NRP-Rights_Manager_inline.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/NRP-Rights_Manager_inline.jpg 890w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/NRP-Rights_Manager_inline.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/NRP-Rights_Manager_inline.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/NRP-Rights_Manager_inline.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/NRP-Rights_Manager_inline.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/NRP-Rights_Manager_inline.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2049479\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits: <\/strong>Facebook<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The new feature is designed more for those who maintain a large catalog of images or who post new content on a regular basis. For individuals who only occasionally encounter issues around misuse of their images, Facebook offers an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/help\/contact\/634636770043106\">IP reporting form<\/a> instead, which even allows users to report more than one piece of matching content at a time.<\/p>\n<p>The topic of who has the rights to use a photo that&#8217;s been posted on Facebook, and in particular, the image-heavy site Instagram, has become more controversial in recent months.<\/p>\n<p>Many had long believed that embedding an Instagram post on their own website was a perfectly legal use case. But when Newsweek asked to feature a photographer&#8217;s image and they declined, the publication ran it as an embed, <a href=\"https:\/\/arstechnica.com\/tech-policy\/2020\/06\/instagram-just-threw-users-of-its-embedding-api-under-the-bus\/\">which then opened them up<\/a> to a copyright <a href=\"https:\/\/www.courtlistener.com\/recap\/gov.uscourts.nysd.524753\/gov.uscourts.nysd.524753.35.0.pdf\">lawsuit<\/a>, filed this summer.<\/p>\n<p>Newsweek had assumed the embed was legally permissible, given that <a href=\"https:\/\/petapixel.com\/2020\/06\/24\/court-reopens-photographers-lawsuit-against-mashable-over-instagram-embedding\/\">Mashable recently won<\/a> a similar copyright case in the recent past. But following the Newsweek case, Instagram clarified that its embedding feature didn&#8217;t include a license &#8212; if someone wanted to use the photo, they would need to ensure they had the proper license to do so. That bit of information came as something of a surprise and the case with Mashable <a href=\"https:\/\/petapixel.com\/2020\/06\/24\/court-reopens-photographers-lawsuit-against-mashable-over-instagram-embedding\/\">was reopened<\/a> as a result.<\/p>\n<p>Until now, photographers had limited means of protecting their content across Facebook&#8217;s platforms. They could only take actions like enabling or disabling embedding entirely or making their account private, for example, to ensure their content wasn&#8217;t used and distributed without their permission. Of course, neither solution was ideal for a photographer trying to gain exposure and grow their career.<\/p>\n<p>The Rights Manager for Images will now allow them a third option, as it&#8217;s capable of finding and matching images that have been used as embeds. At that point, the creator could choose to monitor, block or allow the image as they choose, a Facebook spokesperson told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook says access to the new Rights Manager for Images will be opened up initially to those who apply <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/rights_manager\/apply\">here.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Facebook today is introducing a new tool that will allow rights holders to protect and manage their photos across both Facebook and Instagram.

This year, however, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/apple-burns-developer-goodwill-with-surprise-release-of-ios-14\/\">Apple shocked app developers<\/a> with an announcement during its live event that its new software platforms, iOS 14, iPadOS 14, watchOS 7 and tvOS 14, would arrive in less than 24 hours.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"IS97zDerx8\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/apple-burns-developer-goodwill-with-surprise-release-of-ios-14\/\">Apple burns developer goodwill with surprise release of iOS 14<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Apple burns developer goodwill with surprise release of iOS 14&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/apple-burns-developer-goodwill-with-surprise-release-of-ios-14\/embed\/#?secret=IS97zDerx8\" data-secret=\"IS97zDerx8\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The move was a low blow from Apple at a time when its developer community was already feeling disrespected by Apple\u2019s tougher stance on the use of in-app purchases and increase in capricious app rejections, not to mention the language Apple used to describe their contributions to iPhone\u2019s success in Apple\u2019s lawsuit with <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/epic-games-2\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"epic-games-2\">Epic Games <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>But now <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/ios-14-is-now-available-to-download\/\">iOS 14 is here<\/a>, and with it comes a radical change to how apps are presented and used on iPhone.<\/p>\n<p>App Clips will allow users to launch \u201cmini app\u201d experiences when a full app download isn\u2019t needed, like in the case of needing to pay at a parking meter using a native app. Widgets will allow developers to increase their presence on the home screen, potentially increasing their importance to their most loyal users. But on the flip side, infrequently used apps may now be abandoned in the new App Library.<\/p>\n<p>Any app that doesn\u2019t get a home screen spot in the new version of iOS either as an app icon or widget may soon find that its MAUs and DAUs decline after users upgrade to iOS 14.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"kzCxrMdmFY\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/ios-14-widgets-you-can-try-today\/\">New iOS 14 widgets you can try today<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;New iOS 14 widgets you can try today&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/ios-14-widgets-you-can-try-today\/embed\/#?secret=kzCxrMdmFY\" data-secret=\"kzCxrMdmFY\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Being relegated to the App Library is the equivalent of being stuck inside a folder on the back screen \u2014 out of sight and forgotten. App developers who suspect they haven\u2019t made the cut in the big iOS redesign will need to make clever use of push notifications to rekindle their relationship with users. But this, too, is a fine line. Too many notifications or pushing low-value notifications will see users turning to other iOS tools &#8212; like the option to easily silence or switch off notifications entirely for the app in question. And then, without any visibility or a way to connect, the app will be truly forgotten.<\/p>\n<p>Apple also challenged the entire fitness app industry with <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/15\/apple-launches-fitness-subscription-service-for-just-under-80-a-year\/\">its launch of a Fitness+ subscription service<\/a>. Wall Street investors <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/15\/the-fitness-market-doesnt-seem-too-scared-by-apple-fitness\/\">weren\u2019t too worried<\/a> about the long-term potential impact to top brands, like Peloton and Fitbit. But these companies are not necessarily representative of the smaller fitness app maker. For $10 per month or just $80 per year, Apple is offering a home gym membership of sorts, with deep integrations with Apple Watch. Fitness+ offers workouts and instructions set to music that can be used across Apple devices. Because it&#8217;s from Apple, the workouts will also correctly sync to the Apple Watch for accurate recording of various workout metrics, like calories burned, pace or distance, for example.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"CLNWSBMxiC\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/15\/the-fitness-market-doesnt-seem-too-scared-by-apple-fitness\/\">The fitness market doesn&#8217;t seem too scared by Apple Fitness+<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;The fitness market doesn&#8217;t seem too scared by Apple Fitness+&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/15\/the-fitness-market-doesnt-seem-too-scared-by-apple-fitness\/embed\/#?secret=CLNWSBMxiC\" data-secret=\"CLNWSBMxiC\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The service is also being bundled in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/newsroom\/2020\/09\/apple-one-makes-enjoying-apple-subscription-services-easier-than-ever\/\">Apple&#8217;s new Apple One subscription<\/a> in the upper tier, which may appeal to Apple&#8217;s current subscribers looking to save money by paying for an all-in-one service instead of individual apps. And what could a fitness app maker do to compete with this? Or a music app, for that matter? Third-parties don&#8217;t typically have the option to get bundled into a high-value package alongside other top apps from unrelated industries, unless the company goes out and forges those deals itself &#8212; like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/12\/hulu-and-spotify-launch-an-even-more-steeply-discounted-bundle-of-9-99-per-month\/\">Spotify once did with Hulu<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Given that Apple is still being investigated over antitrust issues, it&#8217;s rather bold to launch a bundle deal like this while continuing to commission its competitors &#8212; rivals who have no other means of reaching iPhone&#8217;s audience outside the App Store.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"dQxLbwpZig\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/15\/apple-one-bundles-icloud-music-tv-arcade-news-and-fitness-for-30-a-month\/\">Apple One bundles iCloud, Music, TV+, Arcade, News+ and Fitness+ for $30 a month<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Apple One bundles iCloud, Music, TV+, Arcade, News+ and Fitness+ for $30 a month&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/15\/apple-one-bundles-icloud-music-tv-arcade-news-and-fitness-for-30-a-month\/embed\/#?secret=dQxLbwpZig\" data-secret=\"dQxLbwpZig\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Another new Apple service puts family tracking apps on notice.

Instead, Apple will lure new customers by making its Apple Watch &#8212; and specifically, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/newsroom\/2020\/09\/apple-watch-se-the-ultimate-combination-of-design-function-and-value\/\">more affordable Apple Watch SE<\/a> &#8212; kids&#8217; first Apple device.<\/p>\n<p>Kids get to use Apple Watch&#8217;s key features, like Emergency SOS, Maps, Siri, Alarms, Memoji, Apple Pay, and more, while parents get to restrict who the child can call or text. By the time the child upgrades to iPhone and the wider world of apps that comes with it, families may see no need for a third-party alternative for family safety. That means kid trackers will need to upgrade their offerings to include features that Apple doesn&#8217;t, like Life360 does with its driving features, like crash detection or weekly driver reports, for instance.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Continuing chaos around the TikTok ban<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>There is nothing straightforward about the <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tiktok\">TikTok <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> ban. Like much of the Executive Order activity coming from the current administration, a broad order is issued but the details are left to be worked out on the fly, leading to chaos.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of the TikTok deal and the app&#8217;s potential ban in the U.S., at the beginning of this week we learned <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-china-bytedance-tiktok-exclusive-idUSKBN2622L6\">China would rather see TikTok banned<\/a> than forced into a sale, and that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/bytedance-wont-sell-tiktok-to-microsoft-or-oracle\/\">neither Oracle nor Microsoft<\/a> would get to acquire TikTok&#8217;s U.S. business. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/microsoft\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"microsoft\">Microsoft <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> was said to have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/microsoft-lost-tiktok-bidding-war-called-tiktok-security-risk-2020-9\">apparently<\/a> pissed off TikTok owner ByteDance by calling the app a security risk and was cut out of the deal. Later in the week, Oracle put out a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/oracle-confirms-statement-301130173.html\">press release<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/13\/oracle-wins-bid-to-buy-tiktok\/\">saying it would be the technology partner<\/a> for TikTok, and Walmart separately <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/walmart-in-talks-with-tiktok-as-oracle-deal-moves-forward-2020-9\">claimed<\/a> to still be involved.<\/p>\n<p>Oh, and it seems <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/instagram\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"instagram\">Instagram <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> founder and former CEO <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/kevin-systrom\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"kevin-systrom\">Kevin Systrom <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/09\/17\/technology\/tiktok-deal-revisions-trump-review.html?smid=tw-share\">approached<\/a> for the TikTok CEO job at one point. Lord.<\/p>\n<p>So what&#8217;s happening now? The U.S. government and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/bytedance\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"bytedance\">ByteDance <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/tiktok-rumors-beg-the-question-did-trump-solve-anything\/\">continue to negotiate on specific terms<\/a>. As of late, the U.S. wants Oracle to agree to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/report-oracle-proposed-tiktok-deal-includes-source-code-audit-2020-9\">review TikTok source code<\/a> for backdoors, ByteDance to create a new organization for its U.S. operations with a board approved by the U.S. government and for there to be a license agreement for TikTok&#8217;s algorithms. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/tiktok-rumors-beg-the-question-did-trump-solve-anything\/\">As TechCrunch reported<\/a>, these terms beg the question as to how TikTok could possibly continue to refine its algorithms in real time without access to U.S. TikTok user data, or when it has to rebuild its infrastructure on Oracle, separated from a core product being developed elsewhere. But nevertheless, reports claim ByteDance has agreed to the government&#8217;s terms and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/09\/17\/trump-to-rule-on-tiktok-deal-in-24-36-hours-oracle-to-take-20percent-stake.html\">also plans to IPO<\/a> TikTok&#8217;s global business.<\/p>\n<p>On Friday, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/18\/tiktok-and-wechat-will-be-banned-in-the-u-s-from-sunday\/\">the Commerce Dept. announced the details<\/a> of how it plans to enforce a shutdown, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.commerce.gov\/news\/press-releases\/2020\/09\/commerce-department-prohibits-wechat-and-tiktok-transactions-protect\">saying<\/a> that both TikTok and WeChat, the other Chinese app impacted by the ban, would no longer be distributed on U.S. app stores as of September 20. But TikTok gets an extension that allows it to still operate until November 12 as the parties attempt to hammer out the complicated deal. That deadline means the app will continue to work through the U.S. elections, based on how the terms are spelled out now. But those could change at any time, given the chaotic nature of how this potential ban has progressed so far.<\/p>\n<p>Despite being one of TikTok&#8217;s chief rivals, Instagram &#8212; which recently copied TikTok with its own feature, Reels &#8212; has come out against the ban.

data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"amazon\">Amazon <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> is making it easier for Alexa device owners to use Routines. The feature, which has been around for <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/09\/28\/alexas-routines-will-combine-smart-home-control-with-other-actions-like-delivering-your-news-and-weather\/\">years<\/a>, allows Alexa users to combine multiple tasks into a single voice command of their choosing. For example, you could make a routine that turns off your lights, plays relaxing music and locks your doors when you say, &#8220;Alexa, goodnight.&#8221; A morning routine could read you the headlines and weather forecast, as well as turn on your connected coffee maker. Now, Amazon will allow users to <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.aboutamazon.com\/devices\/share-and-discover-new-alexa-routines\">share their favorite routines<\/a> with others.<\/p>\n<p>Routines may still be considered something of a power-user feature. Because they take time to set up, it&#8217;s possible some Alexa device owners have never used them.<\/p>\n<p>In the U.S., Alexa users will be able to visit the Routines section in the Alexa app, then click on the routine they want to share to grab a shareable URL. This URL can then be posted on social media, or sent in a text message, email or anywhere else.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>When a user receives a shared routine, they simply click the URL while on the mobile device where they have the Alexa app installed. They&#8217;ll then follow the on-screen instructions in the app to complete the setup. Options that are shown in yellow text will indicate which fields can be customized &#8212; like specifying which smart light you want to turn off or on, for instance.<\/p>\n<p>It would be useful if there was a larger online repository for Alexa routines where you could discover and activate those that have been shared by the wider community, similar to those <a href=\"https:\/\/shortcuts.directory\/communities\">directories<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/shortcutsgallery.com\/\">created<\/a> for sharing<a href=\"https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/shortcuts\/\"> iOS Shortcuts.<\/a> Also useful would be some sort of way to discover popular routines directly within the Alexa app. But these sorts of ideas are not included with the feature&#8217;s launch.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, Amazon today introduced several new shareable routines created by Alexa Skill maker partners, like <a href=\"https:\/\/alexa.amazon.com\/spa\/routines.html#v2\/behaviors\/sharedRoutine?behaviorId=cVFrc-9_QwSdcj7Aqnd7EA&amp;routineType=shared\">NPR<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/alexa.amazon.com\/spa\/routines.html#v2\/behaviors\/sharedRoutine?behaviorId=sa-7WT3sQ9i3IrxbKvYV5w&amp;routineType=shared\">iHeartRadio<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/alexa.amazon.com\/spa\/routines.html#v2\/behaviors\/sharedRoutine?behaviorId=PT_AR4EBTtK1P5q08rwTxg&amp;routineType=shared\">Headspace<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/alexa.amazon.com\/spa\/routines.html#v2\/behaviors\/sharedRoutine?behaviorId=d-J0GJc8QuqagYLZYpT1jQ&amp;routineType=shared\">Fitness Day<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/alexa.amazon.com\/spa\/routines.html#v2\/behaviors\/sharedRoutine?behaviorId=E5BjcWbiSPCwWkaVsnDWgw&amp;routineType=shared\">History Channel<\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.aboutamazon.com\/devices\/share-and-discover-new-alexa-routines\">others<\/a>.

tries to clean up Groups with new policies"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/facebook\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"facebook\">Facebook <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> this morning <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2020\/09\/keeping-facebook-groups-safe\/\">announced<\/a> a series of new rules designed to further penalize those who violate its community standards, specifically around Facebook Groups. It also introduced rules meant to crack down on the spread of misinformation through these more private networks. The changes will impact those who had helped lead groups that were later banned and members who participated in them. The rules will also remove some of the more potentially harmful groups from Facebook&#8217;s group recommendations, among other things.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2019\/01\/making-pages-more-transparent\/\">existing recidivism policy<\/a> was meant to prevent people from creating new groups similar to those that were banned for violating its community standards. However, the rule had only applied to group admins. Now, Facebook says <strong>both admins and moderators<\/strong> alike will not be able to create any new groups for &#8220;a period of time&#8221; after their group had been banned for a policy violation. Facebook tells us this period is 30 days. If after the 30 days, the admin or moderator tries to create another violating group, they&#8217;ll be again paused for 30 days.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, group <strong>members<\/strong> who had any community standards violations in a group will now require post approval for the next 30 days. That means all their posts will have to be pre-approved by a group admin or moderator. This could help groups deal with those whose behavior is often flagged, but it could also overwhelm groups with a large number of users. And Facebook says if the admins or moderators then approve a post that violates community standards, the group will be removed.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Facebook will also <strong>require groups have an active admin.<\/strong> Often, admins get busy and step down or leave their group. Facebook will now attempt to identify groups where an admin is not involved and proactively suggest admin roles to members who may be interested. You may have already received notifications from some of your groups that an admin is needed. If so, it&#8217;s because Facebook identified you as someone who has the potential to lead the group, as you don&#8217;t have a history of violations.<\/p>\n<p>The company will begin to <strong>archive groups without an active admin<\/strong> in the weeks ahead, it said. This will occur when admins leave and no one else assumes the admin role.<\/p>\n<p>This change could help to crack down on the unmoderated flow of information across groups, which can lead to spam and misinformation spreading quickly. It is helpful to have direct moderation, as other forum sites like Reddit have shown, but it&#8217;s often not enough. Group culture, too, can encourage certain types of content &#8212; including content that violates Facebook&#8217;s rules &#8212; and admins are often willing participants in that.<\/p>\n<p>Another change will impact which groups are suggested to users.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Health groups<\/strong> will no longer be recommended, as &#8220;it\u2019s crucial that people get their health information from authoritative sources,&#8221; the company said.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this change alone can only mitigate the danger of misleading health information, but does little to actually stop it. Because health groups can still be found via Search, users will be able to easily surface groups that fit their beliefs, even when those beliefs are actively harmful to themselves or to others.<\/p>\n<p>There are, today, a large number of groups that continue to spread misleading health information or push users to try alternative or untested cures. These group participants may have the &#8220;right&#8221; to have these discussions online, at least in Facebook&#8217;s view, but there&#8217;s disagreement on whether the groups should be allowed the same search billing and discoverability as more expert-led resources.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, if you search Facebook today for vaccines, Facebook will gladly point you to several large groups that tell you not to get one. By doing so, Facebook has effectively taken away medical experts&#8217; and doctors&#8217; authority on health-related matters and handed it over to the general public. Multiply this at the scale of Facebook&#8217;s billions of users and across all subject matters, and it&#8217;s easy to see why simply not &#8220;recommending&#8221; some groups barely makes a dent.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook is also today reminding users of its rules to reduce the spread of <strong>groups tied to violence<\/strong>. It already removes them from recommendations, restricts them from search, and in the near future, it says it will reduce their content in News Feed. These groups are also removed if they use veiled language and symbols in an attempt to avoid being flagged. Recently, <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2020\/08\/addressing-movements-and-organizations-tied-to-violence\/\">790 groups linked to QAnon<\/a> were removed under this policy, Facebook said.<\/p>\n<p>This change, however, comes too little, too late. QAnon, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/53498434\">left unchecked for years<\/a>, has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/08\/12\/technology\/qanon-save-the-children-trafficking.html\">tapped into the mainstream consciousness<\/a> and is now involving people who may not even realize <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tampabay.com\/news\/nation-world\/2020\/08\/14\/whats-behind-viral-savethechildren-posts-look-to-qanon\/\">they&#8217;re being manipulated <\/a>by QAnon-driven initiatives.<\/p>\n<p>Then there is the not-small matter of whether Facebook can actually enforce the rules it comes up with. A quick glance at Facebook search results for QAnon indicates it cannot. It may have removed 790 of these groups, but after scrolling for a couple of minutes we couldn&#8217;t even reach the bottom of group search results after searching using &#8220;QAnon&#8221; as the keyword. And they weren&#8217;t anti-QAnon groups, either.<\/p>\n<p>This demonstrates that much of Facebook&#8217;s work in this area is performative, rather than effective. A one-time sweep of harmful groups is not the same as dedicating resources and personnel to the task of pushing these dangerous fringe movements, violence-prone organizers or anti-medical science believers to the edges of society &#8212; a position they once held back in the offline, unconnected era. Today&#8217;s Facebook instead gives these groups access to all the same tools to organize as anyone else, and only limits their spread in dribs and drabs over time.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, Facebook&#8217;s policy on groups tied to violence practically contradicts itself. It claims to remove groups discussing violence, but <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2020\/08\/addressing-movements-and-organizations-tied-to-violence\/\">simultaneously includes a number of rules<\/a> about limiting these same groups in recommendations and downranking them in search. That indicates even Facebook understands it can&#8217;t remove these groups in a timely fashion.<\/p>\n<p>People disagree whether Facebook&#8217;s role should involve moderating this sort of content on its platform or to what extent any of this should be protected as &#8220;free speech.&#8221; But Facebook never really took a moral position here or argued that it&#8217;s not a governmental body, so it can make its own rules based on what it stands for. Instead, it built out massive internet infrastructure where content moderation has been an afterthought and a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2019\/2\/25\/18229714\/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona\">job to be outsourced to the less fortunate<\/a>. Now Facebook wants accolades for its clean-up work, before it even successfully solves the problems it has created.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Facebook this morning announced a series of new rules designed to further penalize those who violate its community standards, specifically around Facebook Groups.

The feature, Hulu Watch Party, was initially only available for subscribers on the the ad-free tier of Hulu&#8217;s streaming service. Now, the company is making Watch Party available to ad-supported subscribers as well, but in a more limited capacity.<\/p>\n<p>When <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/28\/hulu-launches-a-new-watch-party-feature-for-virtual-viewing-parties-and-chat\/\">Hulu Watch Party launched in May<\/a>, it worked across thousands of movies and TV shows in Hulu&#8217;s on-demand streaming library. As Hulu explained at the time, if a show is available for co-viewing, it will indicate this with a &#8220;Watch Party&#8221; icon on the title&#8217;s Details page. Users can then provide the co-viewing link to those with whom they want to watch together. Currently, a Watch Party session supports up to eight people.<\/p>\n<p>What makes Hulu&#8217;s implementation different from those seen on rival services is that viewers can control their own Watch Party experience. If someone wants to grab a snack or needs a bathroom break, for example, they can pause playback. But doing so doesn&#8217;t impact the group&#8217;s shared stream. Then, when they return, the viewer can either watch what they missed or tap a &#8220;Catch Up&#8221; button to get back in sync with the group.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Hulu says since the product debuted, viewers have used Watch Party to host movie nights and watch new series premieres. &#8220;Palm Springs,&#8221; &#8220;Parasite&#8221; and &#8220;Love, Victor&#8221; were among the top titles that were co-viewed to date.<\/p>\n<p>Now, Hulu wants to bring the feature to ad-supported viewers.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2048091\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2048091\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2048091\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Pen15-Hulu-Watch-Party.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2048091\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Hulu<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The company is testing co-watching on &#8220;Pen15,&#8221; whose season 2 premieres on Friday, September 18.<\/p>\n<p>Over the next 10 days, Hulu subscribers on both the ad-supported and ad-free plans will be able to join Watch Parties for this particular program.<\/p>\n<p>Hulu is also trying out a branded experience within Watch Party for this particular test.<\/p>\n<p>In a nod to the show, the Watch Party interface will be designed to resemble a classic instant messenger chat room, and will include screen names taken from the series. This design will only display when Watch Party is used to stream &#8220;Pen15,&#8221; not other shows. It&#8217;s an interesting example of how Watch Party could help build out more of a fan community around a show by theming the chat interface in a unique way for viewers.<\/p>\n<p>Users today have to be 18 and older to use Watch Party, Hulu says. Support for co-viewing of &#8220;Pen15&#8221; across Hulu&#8217;s tiers is live as of Wednesday and will continue for 10 days from that date.<\/p>\n<p>The company is now one of several to either officially support co-viewing or at least endorse it.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/amazon\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"amazon\">Amazon&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Twitch <a href=\"https:\/\/variety.com\/2020\/digital\/news\/twitch-watch-parties-amazon-prime-video-titles-1234576194\/\">launched<\/a> Watch Parties for Amazon Prime Video following <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/29\/amazon-prime-video-introduces-watch-party-a-social-coviewing-experience-included-with-prime\/\">a built-in feature on Prime Video itself<\/a>. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/28\/plex-launches-a-co-watching-experience-for-its-on-demand-library-and-users-personal-media\/\">Plex<\/a> added Watch Together in May, and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/14\/scener-now-lets-you-co-watch-hbo-or-netflix-in-a-virtual-theater-with-up-to-20-people\/\">HBO teamed up<\/a> with Scener for co-viewing experiences.
