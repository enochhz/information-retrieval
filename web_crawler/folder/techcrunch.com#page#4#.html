The app returned to the store eight hours later, but the controversy and acrimony Google has stirred up in the country will linger for years.<\/p>\n<p>TechCrunch reported on Friday that Google pulled <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/paytm\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"paytm\">Paytm <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> app from its app store after a repeat pattern of violations of Google Play Store guidelines by the Indian firm.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Paytm, which is locked in a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/03\/google-and-walmarts-phonepe-establish-dominance-in-indias-mobile-payments-market-as-whatsapp-pay-struggles-to-launch\/\">battle against Google to win India\u2019s payments market<\/a>, has been frustrated at Google\u2019s policies &#8212; which it argues gives Google an unfair advantage &#8212; for several past quarters over how the Android-maker is limiting its marketing campaigns to acquire new users, sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>The explanation provided by Google to Paytm for why it pulled the Indian firm\u2019s app this week from its app store is the latest attempt by the company to thwart the Noida-headquartered firm\u2019s ability to acquire new users, Paytm executives said.<\/p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.paytm.com\/the-story-behind-paytm-apps-de-listing-from-google-play-store-42b3b6f54da0\">blog post<\/a> Paytm posted Sunday evening (local India time), the Indian firm said Google took issue with the company for giving customers cashbacks and scratch cards for initiating transactions over UPI, a government-backed payments infrastructure in India that has become the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/01\/upi-india-growth-startups-business-model\/\">most popular way for people to exchange money digitally in the country.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Paytm said it rolled out this new version of scratch cards that are linked to cricket on September 11. Users collected these cricket-themed stickers for sending money to others, or making transactions such as topping up credit on their phone or paying their broadband or electricity bill.<\/p>\n<p>In a statement on Sunday evening, a Google spokesperson said, \u201coffering cashbacks and vouchers alone do not constitute a violation of our Google Play gambling policies\u201d and that Play Store \u201cpolicies are applied and enforced on all developers consistently.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But it\u2019s arguably anything but consistent.<\/p>\n<p>On September 18, Google told Paytm that it had pulled its app for not complying with Play Store\u2019s \u201cgambling policy\u201d as it offered games with \u201cloyalty points.\u201d Paytm said that Google had not expressed any concerns over Paytm\u2019s new marketing campaign prior to its notice on Friday, in which it revealed that Paytm app had been temporarily removed from the Play Store.<\/p>\n<p>But Google itself is running a similar campaign linked to cricket in India, Paytm argues. (Why cricket? Cricket is immensely popular in India and one of the biggest cricket tournaments globally, Indian Premier League, kicked off its latest season on Saturday.)<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2049284\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2049284\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2049284 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"286\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg 3284w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=150,42 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=300,84 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=768,214 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=680,190 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=1536,428 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=2048,571 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=50,14 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2049284\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cricket-themed cashback offered by Paytm (left) and Google Pay (right) in India<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Google Play Store in India has long prohibited apps that promote gambling such as betting on sporting events, and Google has raised concerns about Paytm&#8217;s marquee app promoting Paytm First Games, a fantasy sports app run by Paytm, in the past.<\/p>\n<p>Paytm executives argued that <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/phonepe\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"phonepe\">PhonePe, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> a Walmart-owned payments app in India, also promoted Dream11, the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/indian-fantasy-sports-app-dream11s-parent-firm-raises-225m-at-over-2-5b-valuation\/\">most popular fantasy sports app in the country<\/a>, and got away without any action.<\/p>\n<p>Google also permits fantasy sports app operators &#8212; including Paytm &#8212; to advertise on Search in India.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-theme=\"light\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Where is Google hypocritical?

The removal of Paytm app was only on the grounds of Paytm offering cricket-themed cashback, he claimed. \u201cGoogle is not allowing us to acquire new customers right now. That\u2019s all what this is,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s payments app, Google Pay, competes with Paytm in India. In fact, Google Pay is the largest payments app for peer-to-peer transaction between users in India and holds the largest market share in UPI.<\/p>\n<p>Without identifying any names, Sharma, the poster child of Indian startup ecosystem, claimed that many founders in India have just accepted that it is Google that has the final say on any matter in India &#8212; and not the country\u2019s regulatory agencies.<\/p>\n<p>For Google, which reaches more users than any other company in India and whose Android operating system commands 99% of the local smartphone market, this kind of accusation is exactly what it needs to avoid in the country. The Silicon Valley search and advertising giant has launched a charm offensive in India, including a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/13\/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india\/\">recently commitment to invest $10 billion<\/a> &#8212;\u00a0more than any other American or Chinese technology firm.<\/p>\n<p>The timing for Google&#8217;s parent company, Alphabet, couldn&#8217;t be worse. Google is currently the <a href=\"https:\/\/in.reuters.com\/article\/us-india-google-antitrust-exclusive\/exclusive-google-faces-antitrust-case-in-india-over-payments-app-sources-idUKKBN2331G3\">subject of an antitrust complaint<\/a> in India over an allegation that it has abused its market position to unfairly promote its mobile payments app in the country; and in the U.S., Congress has intimidated that it may pursue antitrust regulatory action against Alphabet and Apple over app store concerns.<\/p>\n<p>In India, Google&#8217;s moves could have a devastating impact on businesses and everyday consumers.<\/p>\n<p>Paytm is not just a payments app. It is also a fully licensed digital bank. And just an eight-hour of absence from the Play Store created a panic among a portion of its users. A source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that Paytm saw several people withdraw their fixed deposit in Paytm Payments Bank on Friday.<\/p>\n<p>Anecdotally, TechCrunch heard of instances where vendors who previously preferred Paytm for accepting money digitally asked their customers to use a different payments method as they had heard that Paytm was \u201cbanned\u201d in India.<\/p>\n<p>Sharma said Google&#8217;s monopoly on Indian app ecosystem is of a magnitude unparalleled elsewhere in the world.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf paying someone and getting a cashback is gambling, then the same rule should be applied to everyone,\u201d said Sharma. \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful that we are standing here at the cusp of an internet revolution in India and we are being sanctioned by companies that are not governed by the law of this country.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If this sentiment gained traction in India it could create challenges for Google&#8217;s future in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. is forcing a Chinese company to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/19\/tiktok-deal-terms\/\">sell stakes to local firms to continue operations in the country<\/a>. In a recent episode of Dithering podcast, Ben Thompson cautioned that Trump administration\u2019s move &#8212; which some have argued is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/08\/18\/opinion\/tiktok-wechat-ban-trump.html\">a long due tit for tat against Chinese companies<\/a> (as China has long prevented U.S. firms from meaningfully operating in the world&#8217;s largest \u00a0internet market) &#8212;\u00a0might encourage\u00a0other open markets to do to American firms what it is doing to TikTok.<\/p>\n<p>Several U.S. tech executives share these concerns.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The problem with this TikTok deal is that the US is the largest player in tech globally.

One was innovative, one made clones. One was a free market while the other demanded payments to a political party and its leadership, a corrupt wealth generating scam that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/business\/global\/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html\">by some estimates<\/a> has netted top leaders billions of dollars. One kept the talent borders porous acting as a magnet for the world\u2019s top brains while the other interviewed you in a backroom at the airport before imprisoning you on sedition charges (okay, that might have been both).<\/p>\n<p>The comparison was always facile yes, but it was easy and at least directionally accurate if failing on the specifics.<\/p>\n<p>Now though, the country that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2019\/04\/lithium-ion-batteries-amazon-are-exploding\/587005\/\">exported exploding batteries<\/a> is pioneering quantum computing, while the country that pioneered the internet <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/03\/made-in-america-is-on-government-life-support-and-the-prognosis-isnt-good\/\">now builds planes that fall out of the sky<\/a> (and good news, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/boeing-flags-additional-787-production-problem-11599577936\">we\u2019ve identified even more planes<\/a> that might fall out of the sky at an airport near you!)<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tiktok\">TikTok\u2019s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> success is many things, but it is quite frankly just an embarrassment for the United States. There are thousands of entrepreneurs and hundreds of venture capitalists swarming Silicon Valley and the other American innovation hubs looking for the next great social app or building it themselves. But the power law of user growth and investor returns happens to reside in Haidian, Beijing. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/bytedance\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"bytedance\">ByteDance <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> through its local apps in China and overseas apps like TikTok <i>is<\/i> the consumer investor return of the past decade (there\u2019s a reason why all the IPOs this seasons are enterprise SaaS).<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a win that you can\u2019t chalk up just to industrial policy. Unlike in semiconductors or other capital-intensive industries where Beijing can offer billions in incentives to spur development, ByteDance builds apps. It distributes them on app stores across the world. It has exactly the same tools available to it that every entrepreneur with an Apple Developer account has access to. There is no <a href=\"https:\/\/www.csis.org\/analysis\/made-china-2025\">Made in China 2025<\/a> plan to build and popularize a consumer app like TikTok (you literally can\u2019t plan for consumer success like that). Instead, it\u2019s a well-executed product that\u2019s addictive to hundreds of millions of people.<\/p>\n<p>So much as China protected its industry from overseas competitors like Google and Amazon through market-entry barriers, America is now protecting its entrenched incumbents from overseas competitors like TikTok. We\u2019re demanding joint ventures and local cloud data sovereignty just as the Communist Party has demanded for years.<\/p>\n<p>Hell, we\u2019re apparently demanding a $5 billion tax payment from ByteDance, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-09-20\/trump-wants-5-billion-from-tiktok-deal-for-new-history-project\">which the president says will fund patriotic education for youth<\/a>. The president says a lot of things of course, but at least the $5 billion price point has been confirmed by Oracle in its press release over night (what the tax revenue will <i>actually<\/i> be used for is anyone\u2019s guess). If you followed the recent Hong Kong protests for a long time, you will remember that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-hongkong-patriotism\/hong-kong-frets-over-china-model-patriotic-education-idUSBRE86A09L20120711\">patriotic youth education<\/a> was some of the original tinder for those demonstrations back in 2012. What comes around, goes around, I guess.<\/p>\n<p>Development economists like to talk about \u201ccatch-up\u201d strategies, tactics that countries can take to avoid the middle income trap and cut the gap between the West and the rest. But what we need now are developed economists to explain America\u2019s \u201cfall behind\u201d strategy. Because we are falling behind, in pretty much everything.<\/p>\n<p>As the TikTok process and the earlier Huawei imbroglio show, America is no longer on the leading edge of technology in many key strategic markets. Mainland Chinese companies are globally winning in areas as diverse as 5G and social networks, and without direct government intervention to kill that innovation, American and European tech purveyors would have lost those markets entirely (and even <i>with<\/i> those interventions, they may still lose them). In Taiwan, TSMC has come from behind Intel to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/051b2c80-d53b-410e-8e80-f433d25a82dd\">take a year or two lead<\/a> in the fabrication of the most advanced semiconductors.<\/p>\n<p>I mean, we can\u2019t even pilfer Chinese history and mythology and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/21428088\/mulan-review-disney-live-action-remake\">turn it into a decent god damn film<\/a> these days.<\/p>\n<p>And the fall-behind strategy continues. Immigration restrictions from an administration hell-bent on destroying the single greatest source of American innovation, coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic, have fused into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/international-student-enrollment-trump-covid19-5caad69c-f6d4-4b79-bfb4-7b6ed038bc5b.html\">the largest single drop in international student migration in American history<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Why does that matter? In the U.S. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.insidehighered.com\/quicktakes\/2017\/10\/11\/foreign-students-and-graduate-stem-enrollment\">according to relatively recent data<\/a>, 81% of electrical engineering grad students are international, 79% in computer science are, and in most engineering and technical fields, the number hovers above a majority.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s great to believe the fantasy that if only these international grad students would stay home, then \u201creal\u201d Americans would somehow take these slots. But what\u2019s true of the strawberry pickers and food service workers is also true for EE grad students: proverbial \u201cAmericans\u201d don\u2019t want these jobs. They are hard jobs, thankless jobs, and require a ridiculous tenacity that American workers and students by and large don\u2019t have. These industries have huge contingents of foreign workers precisely because no one domestic wants to take these roles.<\/p>\n<p>So goes the talent, so goes the innovation. Without this wellspring of brainpower lodging itself in America\u2019s top innovation hubs, where exactly do we think it will go? That former aspiring Stanford or MIT computer scientist with ideas in his or her brain isn\u2019t just going to sit by the window gazing at the horizon waiting for the moment when they can enter the gilded halls of the U.S. of A. It\u2019s the internet era, and they are just going to get started on their dreams wherever they are, using whatever tools and resources they have available to them.<\/p>\n<p>All you have to do is look at the recent YC batches and realize that the future cohorts of great startups are going to increasingly come from outside the continental 48. Dozens of smart, brilliant entrepreneurs aren\u2019t even trying to migrate, instead rightfully seeing their home markets as more open to innovation and technological progress than the vaunted superpower. The frontier is closed here, and it has moved elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>So what are we left with here in the U.S. and increasingly Europe? A narrow-minded policy of blocking external tech innovation to ensure that our sclerotic and entrenched incumbents don\u2019t have to compete with the best in the world. If that isn\u2019t a recipe for economic disaster, I don\u2019t know what is.<\/p>\n<p>But hey: at least the youth will be patriotic.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It used to be \u201ceasy\u201d to tell the American and Chinese economies apart.

subscription monetization to more apps in 2016 \u2014 and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2016\/6\/8\/11880730\/apple-app-store-subscription-update-phil-schiller-interview\">enticed developers with an 85\/15 split<\/a> on revenue from customers that remain subscribed for more than a year \u2014 subscription monetization and retention has felt like the Holy Grail for app developers. So much so that <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/googleplay\/android-developer\/answer\/112622?hl=en\">Google quickly followed suit<\/a>\u00a0in what appeared to be an example of healthy competition for developers in the mobile OS duopoly.<\/p>\n<p>But how does that split actually work out for most apps? Turns out, the 85\/15 split \u2014 which Apple is keen to mention anytime developers complain about the App Store rev share \u2014 doesn\u2019t have a meaningful impact for most developers. Because churn.<\/p>\n<p>No matter how great an app is, subscribers are going to churn. Sometimes it\u2019s because of a credit card expiring or some other billing issue. And sometimes it\u2019s more of a pause, and the user comes back after a few months. But the majority of churn comes from subscribers who, for whatever reason, decide that the app just isn\u2019t worth paying for anymore. If a subscriber churns before the one-year mark, the developer never sees that 85% split. And even if the user resubscribes, Apple and Google reset the clock if a subscription has lapsed for more than 60 days. Rather convenient\u2026 for Apple and Google.<\/p>\n<p>Top mobile apps like Netflix and Spotify report churn rates in the low single digits, but they are the outliers. According to our data, the median churn rate for subscription apps is around\u00a013% for monthly subscriptions\u00a0and around 50% for annual. Monthly subscription churn is generally a bit higher in the first few months, then it tapers off. But an average churn of 13% leaves just 20% of subscribers crossing that magical 85\/15 threshold.<\/p>\n<p>In practice, what this means is that, for all the hype around the 85\/15 split, very few developers are going to see a meaningful increase in revenue:<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2048964\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img

class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> one of the pioneers of the gene-editing technique known as CRISPR, thinks the biotech tool could be an essential one for combating COVID-19 and future pandemics. Due to its capacity to be &#8220;reprogrammed&#8221; like software, CRISPR could eventually be integral to countless tests and treatments.<\/p>\n<p>In an interview at Disrupt 2020, Doudna was all optimism for the technique, which has already proven to be extremely useful in less immediately applicable situations.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;One thing that&#8217;s so intriguing about the whole CRISPR technology, it&#8217;s a toolbox and there&#8217;s many ways to repurpose it for manipulating genomes, but also for detection, even getting virus materials and the kinds of reagents that you need for an effective vaccine,&#8221; she explained.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>This is all because of CRISPR&#8217;s main asset: its ability to home in on incredibly specific sequences or structures and manipulate them. Certainly one way to use that is to snip out a potentially harmful bit of DNA, but that bit could also be amplified for easy detection.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is an opportunity to take a technology that naturally is all about detecting viruses \u2014 that&#8217;s what CRISPR does in [its native environment] bacteria \u2014 and re-purposing it to use it as a rapid diagnostic for coronavirus,&#8221; Doudna said.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"zc76zajgYW\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/11\/06\/wtf-is-crispr\/\">WTF is CRISPR?<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;WTF is CRISPR?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/11\/06\/wtf-is-crispr\/embed\/#?secret=zc76zajgYW\" data-secret=\"zc76zajgYW\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The advantages CRISPR offers are threefold, Doudna explained: first, it&#8217;s a &#8220;direct&#8221; method of detection. Current tests rely on enzymes and proteins that are indirect evidence of infection, which limits their reliability and timing \u2014 you can&#8217;t, for instance, detect the virus before it starts producing that secondary evidence. CRISPR detects RNA from the viral genome itself.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re finding in the laboratory that that means that you can get a signal faster, and you can also get a signal that is more directly correlated to the level of the virus,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>Second, the sequence that the CRISPR complex searches for can easily be changed. &#8220;That means that scientists can reprogram the CRISPR system trivially, to target different sections of the coronavirus to make sure that we&#8217;re not missing viruses that have mutated,&#8221; Doudna said. &#8220;We&#8217;re already working on a strategy to co-detect influenza and coronavirus; as you know, it&#8217;s really important to be able to do that, but also to pivot very quickly to detect new viruses that are emerging.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2048435\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/crispr-animation.gif\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2048435\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2048435 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/crispr-animation.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"546\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2048435\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Very long GIF of a CRISPR Cas-9 protein seeking, finding, and snipping out a piece of DNA. <strong>Image credits:<\/strong> UC Berkeley<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think any of us thinks that viral pandemics are going away,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;The current pandemic is a call to arms; we have to make sure that scientifically we&#8217;re ready for the next attack by a new virus.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And third, a CRISPR-based test wouldn&#8217;t be manufactured with the same materials as other tests, making it easier to manufacture alongside them. Managing supply chains effectively will be crucial for getting vaccines, tests and treatments to people as quickly as possible.<\/p>\n<p>The barrier to CRISPR, however, is not theoretical but practical: It&#8217;s still more or less lab-bound because therapies using the technology are still very much under review. It is in clinical trials in some forms and COVID-19-related applications could be fast-tracked, but its novelty means it will be slower to reach those who need it. Not to mention the cost.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This underscores what I think is one of the key challenges that we face in this age of advancing biotechnologies,&#8221; said Doudna. &#8220;That is, how do we make a technology like CRISPR affordable and accessible to a lot of people? I&#8217;d like to see a day when CRISPR is the standard of care for treating a rare genetic disease, and it&#8217;s going to take some real R&amp;D to get there.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps one of the avenues for advancement will be the newly discovered sibling technique, CRISPR Cas-\u03a6 (that&#8217;s a &#8220;phi&#8221;), which works similarly but is much more compact, owing to its origin as, apparently, a countermeasure by viruses that invade CRISPR-bearing bacteria. &#8220;Who knew they carried around their own form of CRISPR?&#8221; mused Doudna. &#8220;But they do, and it&#8217;s a very interesting protein, because it&#8217;s very small compared to the original formats for CRISPR that allows a much, much smaller protein to be able to do [this] kind of editing.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Doudna had much more to say about the possibilities for the technique of which she was one of the chief creators.

id=\"speakable-summary\">The fall semester is off to a rocky start. When schools were forced to close in the spring, students (and parents) struggled. As the new school year begins, affluent families are building pandemic pods and inequities abound, while surveys suggest that college <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/college-students-tuition-discount-online-classes-f13c8db4-1cfe-4af6-89fb-df1805d329fb.html\">students want tuition discounts<\/a>\u00a0for online classes.<\/p>\n<p>To avoid a catastrophic loss in revenue, colleges are bringing students back to campus. At\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2020\/08\/17\/us\/coronavirus-college-university\/index.html\">UNC-Chapel Hill<\/a>, those plans were quickly reversed when 130 students tested positive for the virus just a week into the new semester. As cases skyrocket, UNC will not be the only educational institution or school district to move online again.<\/p>\n<p>What is it about digital learning that has schools so keen on reopening despite the health and reputational risks? Why hasn&#8217;t digital learning lived up to its promise?<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>If I were asked 20 years ago, as the founding CEO of Rosetta Stone, what digital learning would look like today, I would have imagined a very different future. Online learning was exploding. Teachers and faculty were experimenting with now commonplace consumer technologies like speech recognition and virtual reality to create immersive learning experiences.<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, most of these innovations never took hold in our schools and colleges, and remote learners today are left with edtech that feels like it is still trapped in the 90s.<\/p>\n<p>Ironically, the business of edtech and digital learning has been booming. Billions of dollars have been invested in tools and platforms that promise to improve the learning outcomes and lives of students. But for all the investments, headlines and flashy IPOs, edtech has little to show in terms of transformative outcomes.<\/p>\n<p>The United States continues <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/fact-tank\/2017\/02\/15\/u-s-students-internationally-math-science\/\">to lag behind<\/a> many other advanced industrialized nations in math, science and reading literacy. Schools at all levels grapple with pervasive equity gaps. And research shows that heavily investing in education technology has, so far, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oecd-ilibrary.org\/docserver\/9789264239555-en.pdf\">yielded virtually no appreciable improvement<\/a>\u00a0in student achievement in these core subjects.<\/p>\n<p>The challenge stems from the fact that rather than making learning better, the education technology field has, for the most part, focused on reaching more students. In our rush to scale, we have largely ignored tremendous pedagogical innovation that has occurred over the last twenty years.<\/p>\n<p>No matter how high-tech a digital learning solution might be, it means nothing if it doesn\u2019t also reflect recent and emerging changes in pedagogy. In 2010,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/238503302_Does_the_Method_of_Instruction_Matter_An_Experimental_Examination_of_Information_Literacy_Instruction_in_the_Online_Blended_and_Face-to-Face_Classrooms\">a study at the University of North Texas<\/a> compared how students retain information literacy skills in a face-to-face class, an online class and a blended class. The researchers found that there was no difference in outcomes between the three kinds of classes. This is because all three used the same materials and pedagogical approach.<\/p>\n<p>But in a digital environment, far more is possible. We can now create\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/features\/2019-03-19\/a-harvard-dropout-s-plan-to-fix-college-admissions-with-video-games\">video-game quality<\/a> simulations to evaluate complex skills like creativity or problem-solving. Shy students can take the form of learning avatars in online laboratories \u2014 or explore career paths first-hand, through virtual reality. We know more than ever about <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.gutenberg-technology.com\/en\/course-duration-and-its-impact-on-learner-attention-span\">attention span<\/a>\u00a0and engagement, or the connection between\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/my.aasa.org\/AASA\/Resources\/SAMag\/2018\/Sep18\/Darling-Hammond.aspx\">socio-emotional development<\/a>\u00a0and academic outcomes.<\/p>\n<p>Researchers have, likewise, gained a deeper understanding of the ways students\u2019 minds work. We know more than ever about how students reason, process information and solve problems. We know what kinds of scaffolding is required to develop and master these skills. Learning is best when it is built around doing, and when the context is practical, allowing students to try their hand at solving problems even as they\u2019re still learning. It\u2019s best when it is individualized, with progress based on a student\u2019s personal aptitude and proficiency as they move toward mastering the material. And it\u2019s best when it is enriched with peer-based discussion, practice and collaboration.<\/p>\n<p>Astonishingly, few mass-market digital learning tools are built or adopted with these pedagogical advancements in mind. While <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/zoom-video-communications\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"zoom-video-communications\">Zoom <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> is a fine tool for live conversations in small groups, it has few tools to facilitate the kind of engagement necessary for real learning. Coursera has raised millions for simply replicating the old-fashioned experience of a teacher lecturing at the front of a classroom. Quizlet is but a virtual collection of flashcards; it can assess the learning of certain facts, but it is hardly useful for the acquisition of skills. These types of common digital learning tools are increasingly great at making educators\u2019 jobs easier. They are great at expanding access, allowing teachers and schools to reach more students than ever before. But scale, ease and access are not sufficient to help students learn and build skills.<\/p>\n<p>The frustrations of educators and learners alike reflect the fact that education technology functions as a digital proxy for our oldest methods of teaching. Simply listening to a lecture is not effective in the real world, and yet that largely remains the default mode of education online. The impact of COVID-19 has only exacerbated these long-standing shortcomings.

data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"mozilla\">Mozilla <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> today announced that it will shutter two products: <a href=\"https:\/\/send.firefox.com\/\">Firefox Send<\/a>, the free file transfer service it already put on hiatus in July, and Firefox Notes, its note-taking extension and mobile app.<\/p>\n<p>Firefox Send <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.mozilla.org\/blog\/2019\/03\/12\/introducing-firefox-send-providing-free-file-transfers-while-keeping-your-personal-information-private\/\">launched<\/a> in March 2019. At the time, Mozilla described it as a file-sharing tool with a focus on privacy. That privacy is also what is now doing it in. When it paused the service earlier this year, the company said it was investigating reports of abuse, especially from malware groups. At the time, Mozilla said it was looking into how it could improve its abuse reporting capabilities and that it would add a requirement that users have a Firefox Account.<\/p>\n<p>But instead of relaunching it, the organization decided to shutter the service instead.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;Firefox Send was a promising tool for encrypted file sharing,&#8221; the organization writes in today&#8217;s update. &#8220;Send garnered good reach, a loyal audience and real signs of value throughout its life. Unfortunately, some abusive users were beginning to use Send to distribute malware and as part of spear phishing attacks. This summer we took Firefox Send offline to address this challenge. In the intervening period, as we weighed the cost of our overall portfolio and strategic focus, we made the decision not to relaunch the service.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Mozilla says that Firefox Notes was initially meant to be an experiment for testing new ways to sync encrypted data. &#8220;Having served that purpose, we kept the product as a little utility tool for Firefox and Android users,&#8221; Mozilla says, but it is now decommissioning it and shutting it down completely in early November.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard not to look at today&#8217;s announcement in the context of the overall challenges that Mozilla is going through. If the organization were in a better financial position &#8212; and hadn&#8217;t laid off around 25% of its staff this year &#8212;\u00a0 it may have kept Notes alive and maybe tried to rework Send. Now, however, it has fewer options to experiment, especially with free services, as it tries to refocus on Firefox and a few other core projects.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"XzrgT5uI71\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/11\/mozilla-lays-off-250\/\">Mozilla lays off 250<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Mozilla lays off 250&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/11\/mozilla-lays-off-250\/embed\/#?secret=XzrgT5uI71\" data-secret=\"XzrgT5uI71\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mozilla today announced that it will shutter two products: Firefox Send, the free file transfer service it already put on hiatus in July, and Firefox Notes, its note-taking extension and mobile app. Firefox Send launched in March 2019.

data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"amazon\">Amazon <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> is making it easier for Alexa device owners to use Routines. The feature, which has been around for <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/09\/28\/alexas-routines-will-combine-smart-home-control-with-other-actions-like-delivering-your-news-and-weather\/\">years<\/a>, allows Alexa users to combine multiple tasks into a single voice command of their choosing. For example, you could make a routine that turns off your lights, plays relaxing music and locks your doors when you say, &#8220;Alexa, goodnight.&#8221; A morning routine could read you the headlines and weather forecast, as well as turn on your connected coffee maker. Now, Amazon will allow users to <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.aboutamazon.com\/devices\/share-and-discover-new-alexa-routines\">share their favorite routines<\/a> with others.<\/p>\n<p>Routines may still be considered something of a power-user feature. Because they take time to set up and aren&#8217;t necessarily well-highlighted in the Alexa mobile app where they&#8217;re under the &#8220;more&#8221; menu, it&#8217;s possible some Alexa device owners have never used them.<\/p>\n<p>In the U.S., Alexa users will be able to visit the Routines section in the Alexa app, then click on the routine they want to share to grab a shareable URL. This URL can then be posted on social media, or sent in a text message, email or anywhere else.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>When a user receives a shared routine, they simply click the URL while on the mobile device where they have the Alexa app installed. They&#8217;ll then follow the on-screen instructions in the app to complete the setup. Options that are shown in yellow text will indicate which fields can be customized &#8212; like specifying which smart light you want to turn off or on, for instance.<\/p>\n<p>It would be useful if there was a larger online repository for Alexa routines where you could discover and activate those that have been shared by the wider community, similar to those <a href=\"https:\/\/shortcuts.directory\/communities\">directories<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/shortcutsgallery.com\/\">created<\/a> for sharing<a href=\"https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/shortcuts\/\"> iOS Shortcuts.<\/a> Also useful would be some sort of way to discover popular routines directly within the Alexa app. But these sorts of ideas are not included with the feature&#8217;s launch.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, Amazon today introduced several new shareable routines created by Alexa Skill maker partners, like <a href=\"https:\/\/alexa.amazon.com\/spa\/routines.html#v2\/behaviors\/sharedRoutine?behaviorId=cVFrc-9_QwSdcj7Aqnd7EA&amp;routineType=shared\">NPR<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/alexa.amazon.com\/spa\/routines.html#v2\/behaviors\/sharedRoutine?behaviorId=sa-7WT3sQ9i3IrxbKvYV5w&amp;routineType=shared\">iHeartRadio<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/alexa.amazon.com\/spa\/routines.html#v2\/behaviors\/sharedRoutine?behaviorId=PT_AR4EBTtK1P5q08rwTxg&amp;routineType=shared\">Headspace<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/alexa.amazon.com\/spa\/routines.html#v2\/behaviors\/sharedRoutine?behaviorId=d-J0GJc8QuqagYLZYpT1jQ&amp;routineType=shared\">Fitness Day<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/alexa.amazon.com\/spa\/routines.html#v2\/behaviors\/sharedRoutine?behaviorId=E5BjcWbiSPCwWkaVsnDWgw&amp;routineType=shared\">History Channel<\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.aboutamazon.com\/devices\/share-and-discover-new-alexa-routines\">others<\/a>.

adhering to compliance laws. For many growers, large and small, this consists of constant data entry from seed to sale.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canix.com\/\">Canix&#8217;s solution<\/a> employs a robust enterprise resource planning platform with a steep tilt toward reducing the time it takes to input data. This platform integrates nicely with common bookkeeping software and Metrc, an industry-wide regulatory platform, through the use of RFID scanners and Bluetooth-enabled scales.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/canix\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"canix\">Canix <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> launched in June 2019, and in a little over a year (and during a pandemic), acquired over 300 customers spanning more than 1,000 growing facilities and tracking the movement of 2.5 million plants.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Canix\u2019s founders are upfront with the software\u2019s goal: reduce labor cost. During a talk with TechCrunch, the founders stressed how growers could increase margins through improved labor costs.<\/p>\n<p>Growers generally rely on enterprise resource planning platforms to track and forecast their crops, and Canix handles invoicing, costing and reporting while keeping the company compliant. Along with monitoring current inventory, Canix includes forecasting features. Starting with just plant clones, these prediction features will help growers predict yield 90 days away.<\/p>\n<p>Before understanding Canix, it\u2019s essential to know the landscape of growing legal cannabis in the United States. Growers have to adhere to strict oversight, including submitting paperwork each time a plant moves throughout facilities &#8212; and its lifecycle. This involves a lot of data entry, and most states require growers to submit this information in Metrc.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2048102 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/5f5bc69fcf2a6038699b4f1f_hero-image-p-1080-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/5f5bc69fcf2a6038699b4f1f_hero-image-p-1080-1.png 1080w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/5f5bc69fcf2a6038699b4f1f_hero-image-p-1080-1.png?resize=150,96 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/5f5bc69fcf2a6038699b4f1f_hero-image-p-1080-1.png?resize=300,193 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/5f5bc69fcf2a6038699b4f1f_hero-image-p-1080-1.png?resize=768,494 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/5f5bc69fcf2a6038699b4f1f_hero-image-p-1080-1.png?resize=680,437 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/5f5bc69fcf2a6038699b4f1f_hero-image-p-1080-1.png?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/10\/25\/metrc-whose-tracing-system-helps-regulators-track-cannabis-from-seed-to-sale-just-raised-50-million-including-from-tiger-global\/\">Metrc itself is a startup<\/a>. The company launched in 2013 and now tracks cannabis operations in 13 states. In October 2018, Metrc raised $50 million. The platform is designed to track cannabis from seed to sale with a deep focus on compliance. It\u2019s not an enterprise resource planning platform though some growers use it as such for the sake of simplicity. Though detailed and built for a modern agriculture operation, for some growers, inputting data into Metrc is often a labor-intensive job requiring cultivators to employ staffers to remain compliant.<\/p>\n<p>Canix is designed for commercial operations that have a cannabis license. Several startups, including MJ Platform and BioTrack, are building similar platforms for this market, but Canix says the company\u2019s focus on improving data entry makes it stand apart.<\/p>\n<p>Stacey Hronowski and Artem Pasyechnyk founded the company after identifying a shortcoming in Metrc.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I first started <span class=\"il\">Canix<\/span> when I was consulting for a Bay Area cannabis company,&#8221; said Stacey Hronowski, co-founder and CEO. &#8220;I was writing software that would connect their CRM and distribution systems, and reduce the double data entry they did every time they created an invoice. The company asked me to look into connecting the system I built to Metrc. I began looking at Metrc, and I was very surprised to find that growers were writing down barcodes on paper. That was when the initial idea for <span class=\"il\">Canix<\/span> came about.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Hronowski met Canix&#8217;s co-founder Artem Pasyechnyk through a mutual friend at Facebook and they started building a platform. After the beta received positive feedback, the pair expanded to a full-scale operation.<\/p>\n<p>Canix caught the eye of several critical investors in its short life. The company was part of Y Combinator\u2019s summer 2019 program and, in May 2020, raised $1.5 million seed from Floret Ventures, Yleana Venture Partners, Altair VC, Mava Ventures, Nano LLC, and Andrew Freedman (former Colorado Cannabis Czar).<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f63bded444d526870fbcaf3\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Growing cannabis on an industrial scale involves managing margins while continually adhering to compliance laws.

by extension keep the economy fed and well supplied. They also have a dirty side.<\/p>\n<p>The founders of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.clearflameengines.com\/\">ClearFlame Engine Technologies<\/a>, a four-year-old startup based in Geneva, Illinois, say they have found a way to clean them up.<\/p>\n<p>The company, which participated in TechCrunch Disrupt&#8217;s 2020 Startup Battlefield competition, has developed a novel way to get diesel style engines to operate on renewable fuels like ethanol. The technology essentially combines the performance benefits of the diesel engine design with the low costs and the low emissions associated with these alternative fuels, co-founder and CEO <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/bj-johnson\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"bj-johnson\">BJ Johnson <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> said in a recent interview with TechCrunch.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>By replacing 100% of the petroleum fuel with a decarbonized fuel like ethanol, ClearFlame says its technology reduces net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40%, and reduces particulate matter and smog (NOx) to near zero levels.<\/p>\n<p>ClearFlame isn&#8217;t redesigning the diesel engine. Instead, Johnson and co-founder and CTO Julie Blumreiter have developed a way to modify the internal components of the engine to alter its thermodynamics to be able to quickly ignite and combust decarbonized fuels. The company&#8217;s technology means 80% to 90% of the diesel engine parts remain unchanged, according to Johnson.<\/p>\n<p>The upshot is a technology that provides a fast and low cost way to reduce emissions, Johnson told TechCrunch. It&#8217;s the kind of solution that companies might need as local, state and national governments tighten emissions regulations.<\/p>\n<p>The technology can be retrofitted into existing older diesel engines or applied to new engines that have yet to be installed in trucks or used in other industrial applications. ClearFlame is aiming to work directly with the engine manufacturer, which will still give the company access to the secondary market because every OEM has its own aftermarket parts group, Johnson said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We want to leverage their supply chain, their ability to scale and reach these markets, and the trusted name that comes with them,&#8221; Johnson said, explaining the company&#8217;s reasoning for targeting OEMs.<\/p>\n<p>The technology was first developed in a Stanford University lab, where Blumreiter and Johnson earned their Ph.D. degrees. At Stanford, they were focused\u00a0mostly on ethanol and methanol, which are simple liquid alcohols. However, Johnson noted that further research has shown that the same concept works equally well on natural gas and ammonia.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The big difference here is that you have to tweak the injection system if you want to move away from a regular ambient liquid fuel,&#8221; Johnson said. &#8220;There&#8217;s just a ton of business value in being able to run an engine efficiently and cleanly on a fuel that just sits in a glass at ambient conditions, which is what those alcohols do.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>ClearFlame has already made headway with its technology, including landing partnerships and raising capital. The company completed a proof-of-concept demonstration of their technology on a Caterpillar engine at Argonne National Laboratory. ClearFlame is also conducting a demonstration on a Cummins engine platform supported by funding from the Department of Energy.<\/p>\n<p>In April, ClearFlame announced it raised $3 million in a round led by CleanEnergy Ventures. The company has also landed several million dollars in grant money, including Small Business Innovation Research awards from the National Science Foundation, DOE and U.S. Department of Agriculture.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f63b89453fd6e6a449b79ca\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Diesel engines are the workhorses of freight transportation and agriculture \u2014 and by extension keep the economy fed and well supplied.

early-stage health tech fund in Europe, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/15\/crista-galli-ventures\/\">officially launched last week<\/a>. The firm offers \u201cpatient capital\u201d \u2014 with only a single LP (the Danish family office IPQ Capital) \u2014 and promises to provide portfolio companies with deep healthcare expertise and the extra runway needed to get over regulatory and efficacy hurdles and to the next stage.<\/p>\n<p>The firm has an initial $65 million to deploy and is led by consultant radiologist Dr. Fiona Pathiraja. With offices in London and Copenhagen, it operates as an \u201cevergreen\u201d fund, meaning it doesn\u2019t follow traditional five-year VC fundraising cycles.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/crista-galli-ventures\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"crista-galli-ventures\">Crista Galli Ventures&#8217; <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> pitch is that traditional venture isn&#8217;t well-suited to early-stage health tech where it can take significantly longer to find product-market fit with healthcare practitioners and systems and then become licensed by local regulators.<\/p>\n<p>To dig deeper into this and CGV&#8217;s investment remit more generally, I interviewed Pathiraja about what she looks for in health tech founders and startups. We also discussed Crista Galli LABS, which operates alongside the main fund and backs founders from underrepresented backgrounds at the pre-seed stage.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TechCrunch: You describe Crista Galli Ventures (CGV) as an early-stage health tech fund that offers patient capital and backs companies in Europe. In particular, you cite deep tech, digital health and personalised healthcare. Can you elaborate a bit more on the fund\u2019s remit and what you look for in founders and startups at such an early stage?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Fiona Pathiraja:<\/strong> We like founders with bold ideas and international ambitions. We look for mission-driven founders who believe their companies can make a real and positive impact on the lives of people and patients the world over.<\/p>\n<p>We will look for founders who deeply understand the problem they are trying to tackle from all angles \u2014 especially the patient\u2019s perspective, but also that of the clinician and relevant regulators \u2014 and we want to see that they are building their solutions to solve this. This means they will make an effort to understand the complex and nuanced healthcare landscape and all the stakeholders in it.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of founder characteristics, in my opinion, the best founders will be mission driven, able to tell a compelling story, and motivate others to join them.

\u2014 particularly for a startup that began life with space travel in its sights. But the real future of robotics and automation lies in the dull, dirty and dangerous tasks employers have difficult finding human workers to fill. Monitoring grain silos, at very least, qualifies for the first part.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Today at Disrupt, the Edinburgh, Scotland-based company debuted its robotic solution. It\u2019s a small, American football-shaped robot designed to essentially swim inside of a grain silo to offer farmers a better insight into the environmental conditions. Temperature and humidity can have a profound impact on grain storage, and the wrong environmental conditions can lead farmers to destroy significant portions of crop storage.<\/p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\">The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crover.tech\/\">Crover<\/a> robot is design to offer a much more complete and targeted analysis of grain storage than traditional static methods. The robot lives inside the silo and dives into its contents when it\u2019s time to offer analysis.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>All of that information is fed into a dashboard, offering farmers a more complete picture of what\u2019s happening inside.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2045520\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2045520\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2045520\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/device_4-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/device_4-1.png 6000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/device_4-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/device_4-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/device_4-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/device_4-1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/device_4-1.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/device_4-1.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/device_4-1.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2045520\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits: Clover<\/strong><\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Future versions of the robot will be designed to potentially help address some of these issues, but for now, at least, it\u2019s up to the silo owner to take care of the environmental issues when the robot has identified them.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The robot will be offered through a Hardware as a Service subscription model, running farmers around \u00a33,000 (just under $4,000) per robot, per year. The price includes the hardware and software solution. It sounds pricey, especially for a system that requires one robot per silo of grain, but Crover says that grain loss can often cost groups around \u00a324,000 ($32,000) a year.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Crover is still quite a small team, with six full-time and one part-time employee, but the company is poised to start growing after two years. Thus far, its funds have primarily come from grants and bootstrapping. Even so, it currently has two robots being piloted at sites in the U.K. (Scotland and England) and a fair amount of interest from other locations in Europe, including Spain and Italy.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The company is currently shooting for a product launch in May of next year.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f63b7e8444d526870fbb933\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Crover\u2019s robotic platform isn\u2019t the sexiest or most exciting \u2014 particularly for a startup that began life with space travel in its sights.

Farmers have been struggling in India to grow crops, as they are still heavily reliant on rainwater. Those with means have shifted to grow crops such as pearl millet, cow peas, bottle gourd and corn &#8212; essentially anything but rice &#8212; that use a fraction of the water. But most don\u2019t have this luxury.<\/p>\n<p>If that wasn\u2019t enough, Indian cities are facing another challenge: The level of harmful chemicals used in vegetables has gone up significantly over the years.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>A Hyderabad-headquartered startup, which is competing in the <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/techcrunch\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"techcrunch\">TechCrunch <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Disrupt Startup Battlefield this week, thinks it has found a way to address both of these challenges.<\/p>\n<p>Across many of its centres in Hyderabad and Bangalore that look like spaceships from the inside, <a href=\"http:\/\/urbankisaan.com\/\">UrbanKisaan<\/a> is growing crops, stacked one on top of another.<\/p>\n<p>Vertical farming, a concept that has gained momentum in some Western markets, is still very new in India.<\/p>\n<p>The model brings with it a range of benefits. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/vihari-kanukollu\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"vihari-kanukollu\">Vihari Kanukollu, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> the co-founder and chief executive of <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/urbankisaan\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"urbankisaan\">UrbanKisaan, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> told TechCrunch in an interview that the startup does not use any soil or harmful chemicals to grow crops and uses 95% less water compared to traditional farms.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe have built a hydroponic system that allows water to keep flowing and get recycled again and again,\u201d he said. Despite using less water, UrbanKisaan says it produces 30% more crops. \u201cWe grow to at least 30-40 feet of height. And it has an infinite loop there,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Kanukollu, 26, said that unlike other vertical farming models, which only grow lettuce and basil, UrbanKisaan has devised technology to grow over 50 varieties of vegetables.<\/p>\n<p>The bigger challenge for UrbanKisaan was just convincing businesses like restaurant chains to buy from it. \u201cDespite us offering much healthier vegetables, businesses still prefer to go with traditionally grown crops and save a few bucks,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>So to counter it, UrbanKisaan sells directly to consumers.

The duo spent the first year in research and engaging with farmers.<\/p>\n<p>Today, UrbanKisaan has more than 30 farms. All of these farms turned profitable in their first month, said Kanukollu.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are currently growing at 110% average month on month in sales and our average bill value has gone up by 10 times in the last 6 months,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>The startup is also working on reaching a point within the next three months to achieve $150,000 in monthly recurring revenue.<\/p>\n<p>The startup has spent the last few quarters further improving its technology stack. Kanukollu said they have cut down on power consumption from the LED lights by 50% and reduced the cost of manufacturing by 60% per tube.<\/p>\n<p>Kanukollu said the startup works with five farmers currently and is working out ways to find a viable model to bring it to every farmer.<\/p>\n<p>It is also developing a centralized intelligence atop convolutional neural networks to achieve real-time detection to find more harvestable produce, and detect deficiencies in the farm.<\/p>\n<p>UrbanKisaan, which has raised about $1.5 million to date, plans to expand to more metro cities in the country in the coming quarters.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/nk85JF-JH8s?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Severe droughts have drained rivers and reservoirs across parts of India, and more than half a billion people in the world\u2019s second-most populous nation are estimated to run out of drinking water by 2030.

Breen says this is especially important since that approach doesn&#8217;t scale across thousands of devices and can also introduce bugs from the agent itself. What&#8217;s more, it can use up precious resources on these devices if they can even support a software agent.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our sweet spot is that we can protect those thousands of devices by learning those nuances and we can do that really quickly, scaling up to thousands of devices with our generalized model because we take this agentless-based approach,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>By creating these custom firewalls, her company is able to place security in front of the device preventing a hacker from using it as a vehicle to get on the network.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;One thing that makes us fundamentally different from other companies out there is that we sit in front of all of these devices as a shield,&#8221; she said. That essentially stops an attack before it reaches the device.<\/p>\n<p>While Breen acknowledges that her approach can add a small bit of latency, it&#8217;s a tradeoff that CISOs have told her they are willing to make to protect these kinds of operational systems from possible attacks. Her system is also providing real-time status updates on how these devices are operating, giving them centralized device visibility. If there are issues found, the software recommends corrective action.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s still very early for her company, which Breen founded last year. She has raised an undisclosed amount of pre-seed capital.

InsideSherpa, a Y Combinator graduate, hosts virtual work experience programs for college students all around the world.<\/p>\n<p>College students, searching for a way to get job-ready, flocked to the platform from Northern Italy to South-East Asia, to all over the United States. Enrollments in InsideSherpa grew more than 86%, up to 1 million students.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The educational service successfully attracted student interest, and now, has landed investor interest. Today, InsideSherpa announced that it raised $9.3 million in Series A funding, led by <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/lightspeed-venture-partners\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"lightspeed-venture-partners\">Lightspeed Venture Partners <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>. The startup has now raised $11.6 million in known venture funding. Other investors include FundersClub, Y Combinator and Arizona State University.<\/p>\n<p>The financing will be used to grow InsideSherpa\u2019s staff, with more engineering, product and sales roles. Along with the financing, InsideSherpa announced that it has rebranded to Forage.<\/p>\n<p>Forage isn\u2019t selling an internship replacement, but instead comes in one degree before the recruitment process. Students can go to the website and take a course from large companies such as Deloittee, Citi, BCG and GE. The course, designed in collaboration with the particular company and Forage, gives students a chance to \u201cexplore what a career would look like at their firm before the internship or entry-level application process opens,\u201d Brunskill explains.<\/p>\n<p>Forage is focused on partnering with large companies that employ upwards of 1,000 students per year via internships to help open up new pipelines. The corporate partners pay a subscription fee per year to post courses, and students can access all courses for free.<\/p>\n<p>Popular courses include the KPMG Data Analytics Program, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Software Engineering Program and the Microsoft Engineering Program.<\/p>\n<p>While Forage declined to disclose ARR, it confirmed that it was profitable heading into its fundraise, which formally closed in July.<\/p>\n<p>Within edtech, flocks of companies have tried (and failed) to deliver on the promise of skills-based learning and employment opportunities as an outcome. The strategy of getting cozy with corporate partners isn\u2019t unique to Forage, but the team views it as a competitive advantage. Of course, the effectiveness of that strategy matters more than the fact that it exists in the first place. Forage did not disclose efficacy information, but said that &#8220;some&#8221; corporate partners hired up to 52% of the cohort from their programs.<\/p>\n<p>When Brunskill and Rayan first started Forage in 2017, they imagined a mentoring marketplace to connect students to young professionals. Three years later, much has changed.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhile students were interested in the product, they weren\u2019t using it the way we intended,\u201d he said. \u201cStudents kept saying to us \u2018we just want an internship at company X, can you get me one?&#8217; \u201d<\/p>\n<p>While Brunskill doesn\u2019t believe there\u2019s any silver bullet solution to fixing education or recruitment systems, he remains optimistic in Forage\u2019s future. After all, even if democratizing access to skills is the first step in a bigger race, it\u2019s not an easy one.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"oij57aQaC5\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/26\/reskilling-upskilling-future-of-edtech\/\">Who really benefits from reskilling?<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Who really benefits from reskilling?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/26\/reskilling-upskilling-future-of-edtech\/embed\/#?secret=oij57aQaC5\" data-secret=\"oij57aQaC5\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tech\u2019s coveted internships were some of the first roles to be cut as offices closed and businesses shuttered in response to the coronavirus.

href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/justin-kan\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"justin-kan\">Justin Kan <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and Robin Chan have each been angel investing for more than a decade. They\u2019re starting a new fund together now, though, to stay involved as cofounders of more startups.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/goat.vc\/\">Goat Capital<\/a> is a <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/goat-capital\/welcome-to-the-goat-farm-1433c004c966\">hybrid incubator<\/a> versus a pure seed investment firm, Chan explains. It will be writing checks ranging between roughly half a million and $3 million dollars, and it is only planning to raise $40 million \u2014 so the checks will be selective.<\/p>\n<p>The offering is that \u201cyou\u2019re going to be working with Justin and Robin,\u201d he says, as a direct collaboration to help your company succeed. With $25 million closed already from themselves and several family offices, the fund has begun investing globally with particular interests in digital health, ecommerce, digital entertainment and gaming, robotics and climate change.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The goal is not just about being the Greatest Of All Time, Kan adds. In a startup, you \u201cclimb high heights and eat shit to get there. That tenacity is what we want.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a nod to their own successes and struggles as founders over the years, and what they have seen as investors and advisors to a wide range of companies around the world (Twitter, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/xiaomi\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"xiaomi\">Xiaomi, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Bird, Uber, Square, Ginkgo Bioworks, Scale.ai, Cruise, Razorpay, Xendit, Equipment Share, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/wave-financial\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"wave-financial\">Wave, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Teachable, Semantic Machines, Rippling, Built Robotics, etc.)<\/p>\n<p>Kan was a cofounder of Justin.tv, which became <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/twitch\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"twitch\">Twitch <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> as well <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2012\/07\/17\/socialcam-autodesk-60-million\/\">as Socialcam<\/a>. He later had an on-demand company called Exec and previously a calendar app called Kiko, both of which sold for small amounts. Most recently, he took a big shot at the traditional legal industry with Atrium, a law firm and legal software startup that raised big rounds of funding <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/03\/atrium-shuts-down\/\">before shuttering earlier this year<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>His prototype for Goat is Alto Pharmacy, a booming digital health unicorn today that the founders started in his living room.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe do think founders should be treated like athletes, going for gold really hard\u2026 the Olympic metaphor,\u201d Kan qualifies about the name. \u201cThat means grinding for years \u2014 and having to rest, too. I\u2019m very passionate about mental health and wellness as part of the journey.\u201d (<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/01\/justin-kan-opens-up-part-1\/\">More on that here<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>Chan, meanwhile, sold his <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2010\/05\/20\/zynga-enters-asia-with-acquisition-of-gaming-startup-xpd-media-opens-office-in-beijing\/\">gaming startup in China to Zynga<\/a> a decade ago, then helped lead a failed attempt to buy Blackberry before founding <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/22\/operator-dials-china\/\">Operator, a well-funded ecommerce company<\/a> that closed a few years ago. During the pandemic, he helped create <a href=\"https:\/\/www.operationmasks.org\/\">Operation Masks<\/a>, a nonprofit that has been providing PPE across the US. He\u2019s also an ongoing advisor to Sleeper, Bird, Expa and Flipboard.<\/p>\n<p>The focus will be fully global now. Chan explains that even though you\u2019re seeing more challenges to building a truly global company these days, there\u2019s more space for local startups to win big.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s the US internet, the China internet, the India internet, the EU internet \u2014 in some ways it makes those markets more valuable to win, like traditional media. Broadcast and cable are highly geographic but the franchise value becomes higher because of the regulatory moat.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Chan, on that note, met Kan back when he was a director at [current TechCrunch owner] Verizon Wireless, when Justin.tv was trying to negotiate for free data. When I asked if they had worked out a deal during a phone interview, Kan said \u201cyou [expletive] didn\u2019t.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But it did lead to other co-investments later on, including Ramp, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/workstream-2\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"workstream-2\">Workstream <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and others, and now this fund.<\/p>\n<p>Today, Kan says that the focus on teams will be as flexible as the times. \u201cWhen we started, the internet was America,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you weren\u2019t there, you weren\u2019t a company. It\u2019s been a complete reversal of that. Now teams are international, talent is international, more and more companies are building remote first \u2014 although you\u2019d seen that before given the costs of the Bay. We have an entirely remote company in North Carolina, Grammarly in Europe\u2026 it\u2019s more and more the norm. Smart founders are going anywhere to find talent.<\/p>\n<p>For the two partners, this new fund will be about staying connected to that certain startup feeling that is elusive for anyone trying to build something great.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more magical than being in the first step of a special company,\u201d Chan says. \u201cThat glimpse of the future. We wouldn&#8217;t get the same feeling at the growth stage versus working with small teams or a single founder. I think we have the instinct.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Justin Kan and Robin Chan have each been angel investing for more than a decade.

tries to clean up Groups with new policies"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/facebook\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"facebook\">Facebook <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> this morning <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2020\/09\/keeping-facebook-groups-safe\/\">announced<\/a> a series of new rules designed to further penalize those who violate its community standards, specifically around Facebook Groups. It also introduced rules meant to crack down on the spread of misinformation through these more private networks. The changes will impact those who had helped lead groups that were later banned and members who participated in them. The rules will also remove some of the more potentially harmful groups from Facebook&#8217;s group recommendations, among other things.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2019\/01\/making-pages-more-transparent\/\">existing recidivism policy<\/a> was meant to prevent people from creating new groups similar to those that were banned for violating its community standards. However, the rule had only applied to group admins. Now, Facebook says <strong>both admins and moderators<\/strong> alike will not be able to create any new groups for &#8220;a period of time&#8221; after their group had been banned for a policy violation. Facebook tells us this period is 30 days. If after the 30 days, the admin or moderator tries to create another violating group, they&#8217;ll be again paused for 30 days.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, group <strong>members<\/strong> who had any community standards violations in a group will now require post approval for the next 30 days. That means all their posts will have to be pre-approved by a group admin or moderator. This could help groups deal with those whose behavior is often flagged, but it could also overwhelm groups with a large number of users. And Facebook says if the admins or moderators then approve a post that violates community standards, the group will be removed.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Facebook will also <strong>require groups have an active admin.<\/strong> Often, admins get busy and step down or leave their group. Facebook will now attempt to identify groups where an admin is not involved and proactively suggest admin roles to members who may be interested. You may have already received notifications from some of your groups that an admin is needed. If so, it&#8217;s because Facebook identified you as someone who has the potential to lead the group, as you don&#8217;t have a history of violations.<\/p>\n<p>The company will begin to <strong>archive groups without an active admin<\/strong> in the weeks ahead, it said. This will occur when admins leave and no one else assumes the admin role.<\/p>\n<p>This change could help to crack down on the unmoderated flow of information across groups, which can lead to spam and misinformation spreading quickly. It is helpful to have direct moderation, as other forum sites like Reddit have shown, but it&#8217;s often not enough. Group culture, too, can encourage certain types of content &#8212; including content that violates Facebook&#8217;s rules &#8212; and admins are often willing participants in that.<\/p>\n<p>Another change will impact which groups are suggested to users.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Health groups<\/strong> will no longer be recommended, as &#8220;it\u2019s crucial that people get their health information from authoritative sources,&#8221; the company said.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this change alone can only mitigate the danger of misleading health information, but does little to actually stop it. Because health groups can still be found via Search, users will be able to easily surface groups that fit their beliefs, even when those beliefs are actively harmful to themselves or to others.<\/p>\n<p>There are, today, a large number of groups that continue to spread misleading health information or push users to try alternative or untested cures. These group participants may have the &#8220;right&#8221; to have these discussions online, at least in Facebook&#8217;s view, but there&#8217;s disagreement on whether the groups should be allowed the same search billing and discoverability as more expert-led resources.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, if you search Facebook today for vaccines, Facebook will gladly point you to several large groups that tell you not to get one. By doing so, Facebook has effectively taken away medical experts&#8217; and doctors&#8217; authority on health-related matters and handed it over to the general public. Multiply this at the scale of Facebook&#8217;s billions of users and across all subject matters, and it&#8217;s easy to see why simply not &#8220;recommending&#8221; some groups barely makes a dent.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook is also today reminding users of its rules to reduce the spread of <strong>groups tied to violence<\/strong>. It already removes them from recommendations, restricts them from search, and in the near future, it says it will reduce their content in News Feed. These groups are also removed if they use veiled language and symbols in an attempt to avoid being flagged. Recently, <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2020\/08\/addressing-movements-and-organizations-tied-to-violence\/\">790 groups linked to QAnon<\/a> were removed under this policy, Facebook said.<\/p>\n<p>This change, however, comes too little, too late. QAnon, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/53498434\">left unchecked for years<\/a>, has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/08\/12\/technology\/qanon-save-the-children-trafficking.html\">tapped into the mainstream consciousness<\/a> and is now involving people who may not even realize <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tampabay.com\/news\/nation-world\/2020\/08\/14\/whats-behind-viral-savethechildren-posts-look-to-qanon\/\">they&#8217;re being manipulated <\/a>by QAnon-driven initiatives.<\/p>\n<p>Then there is the not-small matter of whether Facebook can actually enforce the rules it comes up with. A quick glance at Facebook search results for QAnon indicates it cannot. It may have removed 790 of these groups, but after scrolling for a couple of minutes we couldn&#8217;t even reach the bottom of group search results after searching using &#8220;QAnon&#8221; as the keyword. And they weren&#8217;t anti-QAnon groups, either.<\/p>\n<p>This demonstrates that much of Facebook&#8217;s work in this area is performative, rather than effective. A one-time sweep of harmful groups is not the same as dedicating resources and personnel to the task of pushing these dangerous fringe movements, violence-prone organizers or anti-medical science believers to the edges of society &#8212; a position they once held back in the offline, unconnected era. Today&#8217;s Facebook instead gives these groups access to all the same tools to organize as anyone else, and only limits their spread in dribs and drabs over time.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, Facebook&#8217;s policy on groups tied to violence practically contradicts itself. It claims to remove groups discussing violence, but <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2020\/08\/addressing-movements-and-organizations-tied-to-violence\/\">simultaneously includes a number of rules<\/a> about limiting these same groups in recommendations and downranking them in search. That indicates even Facebook understands it can&#8217;t remove these groups in a timely fashion.<\/p>\n<p>People disagree whether Facebook&#8217;s role should involve moderating this sort of content on its platform or to what extent any of this should be protected as &#8220;free speech.&#8221; But Facebook never really took a moral position here or argued that it&#8217;s not a governmental body, so it can make its own rules based on what it stands for. Instead, it built out massive internet infrastructure where content moderation has been an afterthought and a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2019\/2\/25\/18229714\/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona\">job to be outsourced to the less fortunate<\/a>. Now Facebook wants accolades for its clean-up work, before it even successfully solves the problems it has created.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Facebook this morning announced a series of new rules designed to further penalize those who violate its community standards, specifically around Facebook Groups.

That will lead up to what producers are currently planning will be a live episode featuring a global viewer vote about who ultimately will win. The show will also include documenting the winner&#8217;s ISS trip, including their launch and 10-day space station stay, as well as their return journey and landing.<\/p>\n<p>To bring all these pieces together, the production team is working with Axiom Space, a private space travel services provider and mission operator, as well as NASA, with which it&#8217;s discussing what might be done in terms of STEM education add-ons for this planned programming.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"qGRWAZdb40\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/05\/axiom-space-pitches-its-first-10-day-all-inclusive-trip-to-the-iss-for-just-55-million\/\">Axiom Space pitches its first 10-day, all-inclusive trip to the ISS for just $55 million<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Axiom Space pitches its first 10-day, all-inclusive trip to the ISS for just $55 million&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/05\/axiom-space-pitches-its-first-10-day-all-inclusive-trip-to-the-iss-for-just-55-million\/embed\/#?secret=qGRWAZdb40\" data-secret=\"qGRWAZdb40\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Deadline says that &#8220;Survivor&#8221; creator and reality industry giant Mark Burnett has previously tried multiple times to create a reality show with a trip to space as the main component.

founders of <a href=\"https:\/\/info.localytics.com\/blog\/localytics-acquired-by-upland-software-to-enhance-customer-experience-management-cloud\">recently acquired mobile analytics company Localytics<\/a>, announced this morning that it has raised $3 million in seed funding led by Eniac Ventures and Underscore VC.<\/p>\n<p>When I spoke to CEO Raj Aggarwal, CTO Henry Cipolla and CPO Randy Dailey <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/10\/localytics-founders-announce-demand-sage\/\">back in February<\/a>, they outlined a vision to make it easier for marketers to get the data and insights they need, initially by automatically generating Google Sheets reports using data from HubSpot.<\/p>\n<p>More recently, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/demand-sage\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"demand-sage\">Demand Sage <span

leaders pulling us in to help them too,&#8221; Aggarwal told me via email. &#8220;We\u2019ve been able to give them visibility they didn\u2019t have, in areas such as where deals are getting stuck and

The Polestar 1 is the company&#8217;s Tesla Roadster while the Polestar 2 is its Tesla Model S.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2029287\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/polestar-1-1.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2029287\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2029287\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/polestar-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/polestar-1-1.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/polestar-1-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/polestar-1-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/polestar-1-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/polestar-1-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/polestar-1-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/polestar-1-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2029287\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Matt Burns<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>I noted this similarity in my write-up about the fantastic Polestar 1 hybrid grand tourer. The large coupe is superb, with excellent driving characteristics and top-notch fit and finish. The Polestar 1 does not feel like the first vehicle from a startup. Compare the Polestar 1 to an early Tesla Roadster (or even current Model 3), and the differences are profound. The Polestar 1 looks and feels as good as anything from Mercedes or BMW, and better than any Tesla model.<\/p>\n<p>And yet, fit and finish is not enough to sell against Tesla because Tesla created a practical and exciting ecosystem around its vehicles.<\/p>\n<p>It starts with Tesla&#8217;s CEO Elon Musk, who alone has a social media presence many multiples larger than Polestar&#8217;s. With a charismatic leader at the helm, consumers are more likely to pay attention. What&#8217;s more, Elon Musk frequently responds and interacts with Tesla owners on Twitter. Love him or hate him, Elon Musk is the world&#8217;s best car salesman.<\/p>\n<p>Polestar&#8217;s social media presence is small. Instagram seems to be its largest channel as its posted 1,366 items to its 356,000 followers. On Facebook, Polestar has 461,000 followers, but the company hasn&#8217;t posted any pictures, stories or posts. YouTube is more of the same where Polestar only has 40,000 subscribers instead of Tesla&#8217;s 1.4 million.<\/p>\n<p>The lack of social outreach seems antiquated and short-sighted; we&#8217;ll talk about this at the Mobility event.<\/p>\n<p>Polestar CEO Ingenlath seems different from Elon Musk in several critical aspects. He&#8217;s measured and focused and appears to be piloting Polestar more like a traditional automaker than a free-wheeling startup \u2014 that&#8217;s likely due to his past positions inside Volvo and Volkswagen Group. He joined Volvo in 2012 and became the CEO of the Polestar subsidiary in 2017. Before Volvo, he was the chief exterior designer for Volkswagen, chief designer at Skoda, and finally, the director of Design at the Volkswagen Design Center.<\/p>\n<p>Polestar is technically an OEM like BMW or General Motors. The company was spun out of Volvo, where it was previously a performance division akin to Mercedes Benz&#8217; AMG division. In 2017 Volvo and Geely (which owns Volvo) spun Polestar out of the fold, although Polestar still retains relationships with both of its parents.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2048287\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2048287\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2048287\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/polestar-waymo.jpg\" alt=\"Polestar illustration\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/polestar-waymo.jpg 3200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/polestar-waymo.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/polestar-waymo.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/polestar-waymo.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/polestar-waymo.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/polestar-waymo.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/polestar-waymo.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/polestar-waymo.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2048287\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Bryce Durbin \/ TechCrunch<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Being an OEM means it&#8217;s more on its own to chart its path to success or failure. As a startup, Polestar faces the same challenges as other startups, most notably other young automotive companies like Tesla, Rivian or Nio.<\/p>\n<p>In an August call with Polestar, CEO Thomas Ingenlath talked about the company&#8217;s retail plans. Unlike Tesla, Polestar vehicles will only be sold through partnerships with dealerships. Polestar vehicles will not be sold directly to consumers. Ingenlath said the company is working with existing Volvo dealerships though the company has fielded outreach from BMW, Mercedes and other dealerships looking to sell Polestar vehicles.<\/p>\n<p>Using existing dealership relationships, Polestar quickly spun up a dealer and service network, while bypassing the trouble Tesla often faces in states with dealership laws.<\/p>\n<p>Polestar also intends to use existing dealerships to build showcase retail locations in high-traffic areas similar to those produced by Tesla. Will shoppers still have to haggle with a dealership salesperson when buying a Polestar vehicle? It&#8217;s unclear, and it&#8217;s likely some potential buyers will be turned off by the thought of having to use a dealership for sales and service.<\/p>\n<p>The electric vehicle scene is quickly growing up, and Polestar&#8217;s positioning puts it in an unusually mature situation ahead of other similarly aged startups.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s thrilling to have Thomas Ingenlath speak at <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/tc-sessions-mobility-2020?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2020&amp;utm_content=polestar&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=polestar&amp;display=\">TC Sessions: Mobility<\/a>.
