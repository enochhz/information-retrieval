But on this record \u2014 while the government has established that China\u2019s activities raise significant national- security concerns \u2014 it has put in scant little evidence that its effective ban of WeChat for all U.S. users addresses those concerns. And, as the plaintiffs point out, there are obvious alternatives to a complete ban, such as barring WeChat from government devices, as Australia has done, or taking other steps to address data security.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Given the likelihood of a lawsuit proceeding and the immediate damage a ban would have if implemented, the judge initiated a nationwide injunction against implementation of the Commerce Department\u2019s order to ban the app.<\/p>\n<p>Commerce will have a chance to respond to this development, and whether it chooses to edit its order, pursue other avenues through the courts, or just rescind the order entirely, we will see in the coming days.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A few days ago, the U.S. Commerce Department published a series of rules that aimed to block the downloading of TikTok and WeChat by American users, following an executive order signed by President Trump back in August.

Users collected these cricket-themed stickers for sending money to others, or making transactions such as topping up credit on their phone or paying their broadband or electricity bill.<\/p>\n<p>In a statement on Sunday evening, a Google spokesperson said, \u201coffering cashbacks and vouchers alone do not constitute a violation of our Google Play gambling policies\u201d and that Play Store \u201cpolicies are applied and enforced on all developers consistently.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But it\u2019s arguably anything but consistent.<\/p>\n<p>On September 18, Google told Paytm that it had pulled its app for not complying with Play Store\u2019s \u201cgambling policy\u201d as it offered games with \u201cloyalty points.\u201d Paytm said that Google had not expressed any concerns over Paytm\u2019s new marketing campaign prior to its notice on Friday, in which it revealed that Paytm app had been temporarily removed from the Play Store.<\/p>\n<p>But Google itself is running a similar campaign linked to cricket in India, Paytm argues. (Why cricket? Cricket is immensely popular in India and one of the biggest cricket tournaments globally, Indian Premier League, kicked off its latest season on Saturday.)<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2049284\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2049284\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2049284 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"286\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg 3284w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=150,42 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=300,84 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=768,214 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=680,190 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=1536,428 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=2048,571 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=50,14 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2049284\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cricket-themed cashback offered by Paytm (left) and Google Pay (right) in India<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Google Play Store in India has long prohibited apps that promote gambling such as betting on sporting events, and Google has raised concerns about Paytm&#8217;s marquee app promoting Paytm First Games, a fantasy sports app run by Paytm, in the past.<\/p>\n<p>Paytm executives argued that <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/phonepe\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"phonepe\">PhonePe, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> a Walmart-owned payments app in India, also promoted Dream11, the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/indian-fantasy-sports-app-dream11s-parent-firm-raises-225m-at-over-2-5b-valuation\/\">most popular fantasy sports app in the country<\/a>, and got away without any action.<\/p>\n<p>Google also permits fantasy sports app operators &#8212; including Paytm &#8212; to advertise on Search in India.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-theme=\"light\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Where is Google hypocritical?

The removal of Paytm app was only on the grounds of Paytm offering cricket-themed cashback, he claimed. \u201cGoogle is not allowing us to acquire new customers right now. That\u2019s all what this is,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s payments app, Google Pay, competes with Paytm in India. In fact, Google Pay is the largest payments app for peer-to-peer transaction between users in India and holds the largest market share in UPI.<\/p>\n<p>Without identifying any names, Sharma, the poster child of Indian startup ecosystem, claimed that many founders in India have just accepted that it is Google that has the final say on any matter in India &#8212; and not the country\u2019s regulatory agencies.<\/p>\n<p>For Google, which reaches more users than any other company in India and whose Android operating system commands 99% of the local smartphone market, this kind of accusation is exactly what it needs to avoid in the country. The Silicon Valley search and advertising giant has launched a charm offensive in India, including a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/13\/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india\/\">recently commitment to invest $10 billion<\/a> &#8212;\u00a0more than any other American or Chinese technology firm.<\/p>\n<p>The timing for Google&#8217;s parent company, Alphabet, couldn&#8217;t be worse. Google is currently the <a href=\"https:\/\/in.reuters.com\/article\/us-india-google-antitrust-exclusive\/exclusive-google-faces-antitrust-case-in-india-over-payments-app-sources-idUKKBN2331G3\">subject of an antitrust complaint<\/a> in India over an allegation that it has abused its market position to unfairly promote its mobile payments app in the country; and in the U.S., Congress has intimidated that it may pursue antitrust regulatory action against Alphabet and Apple over app store concerns.<\/p>\n<p>In India, Google&#8217;s moves could have a devastating impact on businesses and everyday consumers.<\/p>\n<p>Paytm is not just a payments app. It is also a fully licensed digital bank. And just an eight-hour of absence from the Play Store created a panic among a portion of its users. A source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that Paytm saw several people withdraw their fixed deposit in Paytm Payments Bank on Friday.<\/p>\n<p>Anecdotally, TechCrunch heard of instances where vendors who previously preferred Paytm for accepting money digitally asked their customers to use a different payments method as they had heard that Paytm was \u201cbanned\u201d in India.<\/p>\n<p>Sharma said Google&#8217;s monopoly on Indian app ecosystem is of a magnitude unparalleled elsewhere in the world.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf paying someone and getting a cashback is gambling, then the same rule should be applied to everyone,\u201d said Sharma. \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful that we are standing here at the cusp of an internet revolution in India and we are being sanctioned by companies that are not governed by the law of this country.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If this sentiment gained traction in India it could create challenges for Google&#8217;s future in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. is forcing a Chinese company to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/19\/tiktok-deal-terms\/\">sell stakes to local firms to continue operations in the country<\/a>. In a recent episode of Dithering podcast, Ben Thompson cautioned that Trump administration\u2019s move &#8212; which some have argued is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/08\/18\/opinion\/tiktok-wechat-ban-trump.html\">a long due tit for tat against Chinese companies<\/a> (as China has long prevented U.S. firms from meaningfully operating in the world&#8217;s largest \u00a0internet market) &#8212;\u00a0might encourage\u00a0other open markets to do to American firms what it is doing to TikTok.<\/p>\n<p>Several U.S. tech executives share these concerns.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The problem with this TikTok deal is that the US is the largest player in tech globally.

capitalism and the American theft of Chinese innovation"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">It used to be \u201ceasy\u201d to tell the American and Chinese economies apart. One was innovative, one made clones. One was a free market while the other demanded payments to a political party and its leadership, a corrupt wealth generating scam that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/business\/global\/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html\">by some estimates<\/a> has netted top leaders billions of dollars. One kept the talent borders porous acting as a magnet for the world\u2019s top brains while the other interviewed you in a backroom at the airport before imprisoning you on sedition charges (okay, that might have been both).<\/p>\n<p>The comparison was always facile yes, but it was easy and at least directionally accurate if failing on the specifics.<\/p>\n<p>Now though, the country that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2019\/04\/lithium-ion-batteries-amazon-are-exploding\/587005\/\">exported exploding batteries<\/a> is pioneering quantum computing, while the country that pioneered the internet <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/03\/made-in-america-is-on-government-life-support-and-the-prognosis-isnt-good\/\">now builds planes that fall out of the sky<\/a> (and good news, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/boeing-flags-additional-787-production-problem-11599577936\">we\u2019ve identified even more planes<\/a> that might fall out of the sky at an airport near you!)<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tiktok\">TikTok\u2019s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> success is many things, but it is quite frankly just an embarrassment for the United States. There are thousands of entrepreneurs and hundreds of venture capitalists swarming Silicon Valley and the other American innovation hubs looking for the next great social app or building it themselves. But the power law of user growth and investor returns happens to reside in Haidian, Beijing. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/bytedance\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"bytedance\">ByteDance <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> through its local apps in China and overseas apps like TikTok <i>is<\/i> the consumer investor return of the past decade (there\u2019s a reason why all the IPOs this seasons are enterprise SaaS).<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a win that you can\u2019t chalk up just to industrial policy. Unlike in semiconductors or other capital-intensive industries where Beijing can offer billions in incentives to spur development, ByteDance builds apps. It distributes them on app stores across the world. It has exactly the same tools available to it that every entrepreneur with an Apple Developer account has access to. There is no <a href=\"https:\/\/www.csis.org\/analysis\/made-china-2025\">Made in China 2025<\/a> plan to build and popularize a consumer app like TikTok (you literally can\u2019t plan for consumer success like that). Instead, it\u2019s a well-executed product that\u2019s addictive to hundreds of millions of people.<\/p>\n<p>So much as China protected its industry from overseas competitors like Google and Amazon through market-entry barriers, America is now protecting its entrenched incumbents from overseas competitors like TikTok. We\u2019re demanding joint ventures and local cloud data sovereignty just as the Communist Party has demanded for years.<\/p>\n<p>Hell, we\u2019re apparently demanding a $5 billion tax payment from ByteDance, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-09-20\/trump-wants-5-billion-from-tiktok-deal-for-new-history-project\">which the president says will fund patriotic education for youth<\/a>. The president says a lot of things of course, but at least the $5 billion price point has been confirmed by Oracle in its press release over night (what the tax revenue will <i>actually<\/i> be used for is anyone\u2019s guess). If you followed the recent Hong Kong protests for a long time, you will remember that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-hongkong-patriotism\/hong-kong-frets-over-china-model-patriotic-education-idUSBRE86A09L20120711\">patriotic youth education<\/a> was some of the original tinder for those demonstrations back in 2012. What comes around, goes around, I guess.<\/p>\n<p>Development economists like to talk about \u201ccatch-up\u201d strategies, tactics that countries can take to avoid the middle income trap and cut the gap between the West and the rest. But what we need now are developed economists to explain America\u2019s \u201cfall behind\u201d strategy. Because we are falling behind, in pretty much everything.<\/p>\n<p>As the TikTok process and the earlier Huawei imbroglio show, America is no longer on the leading edge of technology in many key strategic markets. Mainland Chinese companies are globally winning in areas as diverse as 5G and social networks, and without direct government intervention to kill that innovation, American and European tech purveyors would have lost those markets entirely (and even <i>with<\/i> those interventions, they may still lose them). In Taiwan, TSMC has come from behind Intel to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/051b2c80-d53b-410e-8e80-f433d25a82dd\">take a year or two lead<\/a> in the fabrication of the most advanced semiconductors.<\/p>\n<p>I mean, we can\u2019t even pilfer Chinese history and mythology and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/21428088\/mulan-review-disney-live-action-remake\">turn it into a decent god damn film<\/a> these days.<\/p>\n<p>And the fall-behind strategy continues. Immigration restrictions from an administration hell-bent on destroying the single greatest source of American innovation, coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic, have fused into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/international-student-enrollment-trump-covid19-5caad69c-f6d4-4b79-bfb4-7b6ed038bc5b.html\">the largest single drop in international student migration in American history<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Why does that matter? In the U.S. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.insidehighered.com\/quicktakes\/2017\/10\/11\/foreign-students-and-graduate-stem-enrollment\">according to relatively recent data<\/a>, 81% of electrical engineering grad students are international, 79% in computer science are, and in most engineering and technical fields, the number hovers above a majority.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s great to believe the fantasy that if only these international grad students would stay home, then \u201creal\u201d Americans would somehow take these slots. But what\u2019s true of the strawberry pickers and food service workers is also true for EE grad students: proverbial \u201cAmericans\u201d don\u2019t want these jobs. They are hard jobs, thankless jobs, and require a ridiculous tenacity that American workers and students by and large don\u2019t have. These industries have huge contingents of foreign workers precisely because no one domestic wants to take these roles.<\/p>\n<p>So goes the talent, so goes the innovation. Without this wellspring of brainpower lodging itself in America\u2019s top innovation hubs, where exactly do we think it will go? That former aspiring Stanford or MIT computer scientist with ideas in his or her brain isn\u2019t just going to sit by the window gazing at the horizon waiting for the moment when they can enter the gilded halls of the U.S. of A. It\u2019s the internet era, and they are just going to get started on their dreams wherever they are, using whatever tools and resources they have available to them.<\/p>\n<p>All you have to do is look at the recent YC batches and realize that the future cohorts of great startups are going to increasingly come from outside the continental 48. Dozens of smart, brilliant entrepreneurs aren\u2019t even trying to migrate, instead rightfully seeing their home markets as more open to innovation and technological progress than the vaunted superpower. The frontier is closed here, and it has moved elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>So what are we left with here in the U.S. and increasingly Europe? A narrow-minded policy of blocking external tech innovation to ensure that our sclerotic and entrenched incumbents don\u2019t have to compete with the best in the world. If that isn\u2019t a recipe for economic disaster, I don\u2019t know what is.<\/p>\n<p>But hey: at least the youth will be patriotic.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It used to be \u201ceasy\u201d to tell the American and Chinese economies apart.

subscription monetization to more apps in 2016 \u2014 and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2016\/6\/8\/11880730\/apple-app-store-subscription-update-phil-schiller-interview\">enticed developers with an 85\/15 split<\/a> on revenue from customers that remain subscribed for more than a year \u2014 subscription monetization and retention has felt like the Holy Grail for app developers. So much so that <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/googleplay\/android-developer\/answer\/112622?hl=en\">Google quickly followed suit<\/a>\u00a0in what appeared to be an example of healthy competition for developers in the mobile OS duopoly.<\/p>\n<p>But how does that split actually work out for most apps? Turns out, the 85\/15 split \u2014 which Apple is keen to mention anytime developers complain about the App Store rev share \u2014 doesn\u2019t have a meaningful impact for most developers. Because churn.<\/p>\n<p>No matter how great an app is, subscribers are going to churn. Sometimes it\u2019s because of a credit card expiring or some other billing issue. And sometimes it\u2019s more of a pause, and the user comes back after a few months. But the majority of churn comes from subscribers who, for whatever reason, decide that the app just isn\u2019t worth paying for anymore. If a subscriber churns before the one-year mark, the developer never sees that 85% split. And even if the user resubscribes, Apple and Google reset the clock if a subscription has lapsed for more than 60 days. Rather convenient\u2026 for Apple and Google.<\/p>\n<p>Top mobile apps like Netflix and Spotify report churn rates in the low single digits, but they are the outliers. According to our data, the median churn rate for subscription apps is around\u00a013% for monthly subscriptions\u00a0and around 50% for annual. Monthly subscription churn is generally a bit higher in the first few months, then it tapers off. But an average churn of 13% leaves just 20% of subscribers crossing that magical 85\/15 threshold.<\/p>\n<p>In practice, what this means is that, for all the hype around the 85\/15 split, very few developers are going to see a meaningful increase in revenue:<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2048964\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img

Capital closes \u00a381M second fund to back early-stage European startups"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.kindredcapital.vc\/\">Kindred Capital<\/a>, the London-based VC that backs early-stage founders in Europe, has closed its second seed fund at \u00a381 million.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s only a tad larger than the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/02\/28\/kindred-capital\/\">the firm&#8217;s first fund<\/a>, which invested in 29 companies and was raised in 2018. Portfolio companies from fund one include Five, which is building software for autonomous vehicles; Paddle, the SaaS for software e-commerce; Pollen, the peer-to-peer marketplace for experiences and travel; and Farewill, which lets you create a will online.<\/p>\n<p>However, perhaps what really sets Kindred apart from most other seed VCs is its &#8220;Equitable Venture&#8221;. This sees the founders it backs get carry in the fund, effectively becoming co-owners of Kindred. Once the VC&#8217;s LPs have their investment returned, like the firm&#8217;s partners, the founders also share any subsequent fund profits, as long as they have passed the vesting period.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>More broadly, Kindred says the idea is this extra incentive encourages a collective model, in which founders actively help each other achieve their goals. &#8220;This has also had a positive impact on deal flow, with entrepreneurs sourcing 38% of Kindred\u2019s dealflow at the top of the funnel,&#8221; says the VC.<\/p>\n<p>Notably, Kindred projects that around \u00a35 million will be returned to founders from the first find, profit that would otherwise have gone to its own General Partners. Presuming those exits are realised, based on two founders per startup, a quick back of the napkin calculation suggests that&#8217;s just over \u00a380,000 each.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Kindred already begun investing from its second fund. It has led 10 seed investments in companies such as BotsAndUs, Gravity Sketch and Beit.<\/p>\n<p>LPs in Fund two include: University of Chicago, Industry Ventures, Generation Ventures, Sands Capital, British Patient Capital, Isomer, and Legal &amp; General. Founders such as Taavet Hinrikus (TransferWise), Carsten Thoma (Hybris), and Rishi Khosla (Oak North), have also invested in Kindred&#8217;s second fund.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"n3tjnMddnL\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/02\/pollen-clause-for-concern\/\">Former Pollen employees were asked to sign an &#8216;NDA masked as a severance agreement&#8217;<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Former Pollen employees were asked to sign an &#8216;NDA masked as a severance agreement&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/02\/pollen-clause-for-concern\/embed\/#?secret=n3tjnMddnL\" data-secret=\"n3tjnMddnL\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Kindred Capital, the London-based VC that backs early-stage founders in Europe, has closed its second seed fund at \u00a381 million.

Walmart CEO Doug McMillon is the latest addition to the board.<\/p>\n<h2>TikTok seeks US IPO<\/h2>\n<p>TikTok confirms it&#8217;s seeking an initial public offering in the U.S. in an effort to &#8220;further enhance corporate governance and transparency.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Clearly, the video app hopes an IPO, which will expose it to more public scrutiny, could allay fears over the alleged national security threat attached to its Chinese origin.<\/p>\n<p>Notably, ByteDance refers to the video app as &#8220;TikTok Global&#8221; in the statement, suggesting the app won&#8217;t be split into a U.S. unit and the rest of the world. TikTok claims nearly 700 million monthly users around the globe, as revealed in a <a href=\"https:\/\/assets.documentcloud.org\/documents\/7043165\/TikTok-Trump-Complaint.pdf\">court document<\/a>. 100 million of the users are based in the U.S., where its current headquarters is.<\/p>\n<h2>No algorithm transfer<\/h2>\n<p>In line with previous <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/bytedance-wont-sell-tiktok-to-microsoft-or-oracle\/\">reports<\/a>, ByteDance won&#8217;t be handing over TikTok&#8217;s algorithms or technologies to Oracle. Instead, the American database giant will gain the authority to perform security checks on &#8220;TikTok&#8217;s U.S. source codes.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Revealing source codes is a universal solution to data security challenges posed to multinational corporations,&#8221; ByteDance said, attempting to equate its decision to <a href=\"https:\/\/blogs.microsoft.com\/on-the-issues\/2016\/09\/19\/new-beijing-transparency-center-announced\/\">Microsoft&#8217;s Transparency Center<\/a> in China as well as a<a href=\"https:\/\/news-blogs.cisco.com\/emear\/de\/2019\/11\/29\/cisco-eroeffnet-technology-verification-service-center-in-bonn\/\">\u00a0similar facility<\/a> Cisco set up in Bonn, Germany.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s still unclear how Oracle&#8217;s role as a code inspector and user data host will resolve concerns around Beijing&#8217;s possible tinkering of TikTok&#8217;s content black box.<\/p>\n<h2>$5 billion tax dollars<\/h2>\n<p>ByteDance estimates that TikTok will pay a total of $5 billion in income tax and other tax dollars incurred in business to the U.S. Treasury in the coming years. Nonetheless, the final figure is contingent on TikTok&#8217;s &#8220;actual business performance and the U.S. tax structure,&#8221; the parent said, stressing that the tax money has &#8220;nothing to do with the ongoing deal.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Educational commitment<\/h2>\n<p>In response to reports claiming TikTok will be setting up a $5 billion education fund in the U.S., ByteDance said it was not aware of such a plan but has consistently devoted effort to education, including working with its &#8220;partners and shareholders&#8221; to design online classes powered by artificial intelligence and videos.<\/p>\n<p>In China, ByteDance&#8217;s incursion into education has been widely reported. Asides from proprietary products like the <a href=\"https:\/\/teacher.gogokid.com\/\">English-learning platform Gogokid<\/a>, the company also invested in a range of outside players including Minerva, the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2012\/04\/03\/minerva-gets-25m-from-benchmark\/\">venture-backed institution<\/a> challenging traditional higher education.<\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There is no shortage of speculation and reports around TikTok&#8217;s future in the U.S. Amid a swirl of rumors, TikTok&#8217;s Chinese parent ByteDance issued a statement (in Chinese) on Monday morning, bringing clarity to its ongoing deal that has captured global attention over the past few weeks.

Zoe Lofgren, whose congressional seat covers much of Silicon Valley, told TechCrunch at <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/video\/spycraft-and-cybersecurity\/\">Disrupt 2020<\/a>. &#8220;If we eliminate encryption, we&#8217;re just opening ourselves up to massive hacking and disruption,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f6516f1550d252b740c5bd9\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n<p>Lofgren&#8217;s comments echo those of critics and security experts, who have long criticized efforts to undermine encryption, arguing that there is no way to build a backdoor for law enforcement that could not also be exploited by hackers.<\/p>\n<p>Several previous efforts by lawmakers to weaken and undermine encryption <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/04\/08\/feinstein-and-burrs-draft-encryption-bill-would-essentially-make-all-encryption-illegal\/\">have failed<\/a>. Currently, law enforcement has to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/22\/the-fbi-is-mad-because-it-keeps-getting-into-locked-iphones-without-apples-help\/\">use existing tools and techniques<\/a> to find weaknesses in phones and computers.

In 2016, Lofgren was part of an encryption working group on the House Judiciary Committee. The group&#8217;s final report, bipartisan but not binding, found that any measures to undermine encryption &#8220;works against the national interest.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Still, it&#8217;s a talking point that the government continues to push, even as recently as this year when U.S. Attorney General <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/william-barr\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"william-barr\">William Barr <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> said that Americans <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/23\/william-barr-consumers-security-risks-backdoors\/\">should accept<\/a> the security risks that encryption backdoors pose.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You cannot eliminate encryption safely,&#8221; Lofgren told TechCrunch. &#8220;And if you do, you will create chaos in the country and for Americans, not to mention others around the world,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s just an unsafe thing to do, and we can&#8217;t permit it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ilbdSmtJtL\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/22\/the-fbi-is-mad-because-it-keeps-getting-into-locked-iphones-without-apples-help\/\">The FBI is mad because it keeps getting into locked iPhones without Apple\u2019s help<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;The FBI is mad because it keeps getting into locked iPhones without Apple\u2019s help&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/22\/the-fbi-is-mad-because-it-keeps-getting-into-locked-iphones-without-apples-help\/embed\/#?secret=ilbdSmtJtL\" data-secret=\"ilbdSmtJtL\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;You cannot eliminate encryption safely,&#8221; said the House Democrat.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":133574210,"featured_media":2049325,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","carmot_uuid":"af69c0ca-a269-3309-bc85-b858961f851b"},"categories":[15986864,21587494],"tags":[291,576761438,8159,4308,449552553,25818,576771694,6474,46227,7054,449557049,576631551,576768328],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[],"tc_event":[576703170],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/GettyImages-1198389308.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/2RLPSMO","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"featured":true,"subtitle":"","fundingRound":false,"seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","premiumContent":false,"premiumCutoffPercent":1,"tc_cb_mapping":[{"slug":"william-barr","cb_name":"William Barr","cb_slug":"william-barr-person","cb_link":"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/william-barr"},{"slug":"apple","cb_name":"Apple","cb_slug":"apple-organization","cb_link":"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/apple"}],"associatedEvent":{"ad":{"title":"Disrupt is happening right now!

Users collected these cricket-themed stickers for sending money to others, or making transactions such as topping up credit on their phone or paying their broadband or electricity bill.<\/p>\n<p>In a statement on Sunday evening, a Google spokesperson said, \u201coffering cashbacks and vouchers alone do not constitute a violation of our Google Play gambling policies\u201d and that Play Store \u201cpolicies are applied and enforced on all developers consistently.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But it\u2019s arguably anything but consistent.<\/p>\n<p>On September 18, Google told Paytm that it had pulled its app for not complying with Play Store\u2019s \u201cgambling policy\u201d as it offered games with \u201cloyalty points.\u201d Paytm said that Google had not expressed any concerns over Paytm\u2019s new marketing campaign prior to its notice on Friday, in which it revealed that Paytm app had been temporarily removed from the Play Store.<\/p>\n<p>But Google itself is running a similar campaign linked to cricket in India, Paytm argues. (Why cricket? Cricket is immensely popular in India and one of the biggest cricket tournaments globally, Indian Premier League, kicked off its latest season on Saturday.)<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2049284\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2049284\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2049284 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"286\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg 3284w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=150,42 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=300,84 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=768,214 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=680,190 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=1536,428 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=2048,571 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=50,14 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2049284\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cricket-themed cashback offered by Paytm (left) and Google Pay (right) in India<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Google Play Store in India has long prohibited apps that promote gambling such as betting on sporting events, and Google has raised concerns about Paytm&#8217;s marquee app promoting Paytm First Games, a fantasy sports app run by Paytm, in the past.<\/p>\n<p>Paytm executives argued that <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/phonepe\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"phonepe\">PhonePe, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> a Walmart-owned payments app in India, also promoted Dream11, the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/indian-fantasy-sports-app-dream11s-parent-firm-raises-225m-at-over-2-5b-valuation\/\">most popular fantasy sports app in the country<\/a>, and got away without any action.<\/p>\n<p>Google also permits fantasy sports app operators &#8212; including Paytm &#8212; to advertise on Search in India.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-theme=\"light\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Where is Google hypocritical?

The removal of Paytm app was only on the grounds of Paytm offering cricket-themed cashback, he claimed. \u201cGoogle is not allowing us to acquire new customers right now. That\u2019s all what this is,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s payments app, Google Pay, competes with Paytm in India. In fact, Google Pay is the largest payments app for peer-to-peer transaction between users in India and holds the largest market share in UPI.<\/p>\n<p>Without identifying any names, Sharma, the poster child of Indian startup ecosystem, claimed that many founders in India have just accepted that it is Google that has the final say on any matter in India &#8212; and not the country\u2019s regulatory agencies.<\/p>\n<p>For Google, which reaches more users than any other company in India and whose Android operating system commands 99% of the local smartphone market, this kind of accusation is exactly what it needs to avoid in the country. The Silicon Valley search and advertising giant has launched a charm offensive in India, including a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/13\/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india\/\">recently commitment to invest $10 billion<\/a> &#8212;\u00a0more than any other American or Chinese technology firm.<\/p>\n<p>The timing for Google&#8217;s parent company, Alphabet, couldn&#8217;t be worse. Google is currently the <a href=\"https:\/\/in.reuters.com\/article\/us-india-google-antitrust-exclusive\/exclusive-google-faces-antitrust-case-in-india-over-payments-app-sources-idUKKBN2331G3\">subject of an antitrust complaint<\/a> in India over an allegation that it has abused its market position to unfairly promote its mobile payments app in the country; and in the U.S., Congress has intimidated that it may pursue antitrust regulatory action against Alphabet and Apple over app store concerns.<\/p>\n<p>In India, Google&#8217;s moves could have a devastating impact on businesses and everyday consumers.<\/p>\n<p>Paytm is not just a payments app. It is also a fully licensed digital bank. And just an eight-hour of absence from the Play Store created a panic among a portion of its users. A source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that Paytm saw several people withdraw their fixed deposit in Paytm Payments Bank on Friday.<\/p>\n<p>Anecdotally, TechCrunch heard of instances where vendors who previously preferred Paytm for accepting money digitally asked their customers to use a different payments method as they had heard that Paytm was \u201cbanned\u201d in India.<\/p>\n<p>Sharma said Google&#8217;s monopoly on Indian app ecosystem is of a magnitude unparalleled elsewhere in the world.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf paying someone and getting a cashback is gambling, then the same rule should be applied to everyone,\u201d said Sharma. \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful that we are standing here at the cusp of an internet revolution in India and we are being sanctioned by companies that are not governed by the law of this country.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If this sentiment gained traction in India it could create challenges for Google&#8217;s future in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. is forcing a Chinese company to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/19\/tiktok-deal-terms\/\">sell stakes to local firms to continue operations in the country<\/a>. In a recent episode of Dithering podcast, Ben Thompson cautioned that Trump administration\u2019s move &#8212; which some have argued is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/08\/18\/opinion\/tiktok-wechat-ban-trump.html\">a long due tit for tat against Chinese companies<\/a> (as China has long prevented U.S. firms from meaningfully operating in the world&#8217;s largest \u00a0internet market) &#8212;\u00a0might encourage\u00a0other open markets to do to American firms what it is doing to TikTok.<\/p>\n<p>Several U.S. tech executives share these concerns.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The problem with this TikTok deal is that the US is the largest player in tech globally.

At TechCrunch Disrupt 2020 we talked to <a href=\"https:\/\/fazeclan.com\/\">FaZe Clan<\/a> CEO Lee Trink, investor Troy Carter, and Nick Kolcheff, better known as <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NICKMERCS\">NICKMERCS<\/a>, about the shifting industry landscape.<\/p>\n<p>Carter first explained the motivation behind his interest in investing in <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/faze-clan\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"faze-clan\">FaZe Clan <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>. &#8220;My diligence in this process was different from the diligence that I usually do in companies because I went and asked my son, who was 14 at the time, what do you think about me investing in FaZe, and he lit up. He lit up,&#8221; Carter told moderator and TechCrunch Managing Editor Jordan Crook.<\/p>\n<p>As a veteran streamer, Kolcheff also shed some light on his work ethic and how he keeps producing. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been a streamer for 10 years now, so it&#8217;s it&#8217;s getting to the point now where it&#8217;s like&#8230; I&#8217;ll go to bed some days after a long stream Kolcheff said. &#8220;So it&#8217;s just my mind is so wired, I&#8217;m so in it 24\/7 that I think that it just becomes your routine and your life and that&#8217;s what it is for me.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Kolcheff touched on the responsibilities of streamers to act responsibly and the challenges that can emerge for younger streamers to deal with seeing their influence expand so rapidly. &#8220;A lot of these kids blow up fast on the internet and go from having like four or five viewers to hundreds or thousands and then they have to be more careful &#8212; like you can&#8217;t say all these crazy things.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/nickmercs\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"nickmercs\">NICKMERCS <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> boasts a substantial following across the platform with 4.3 million Twitch followers and more than 2.8 million YouTube subscribers. He talked about how he balances maintaining his following while also competing professionally.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">&#8220;I think one of the best things about being on FaZe for me is that I&#8217;m already so busy on a day to day with everything I&#8217;ve got going on with the stream and YouTube and all of that stuff,&#8221; Kolcheff told TechCrunch. &#8220;You know, a lot of other orgs have been out there always trying to draw you away from some of those things and put a lot more on your plate, and that&#8217;s okay, but like for me, I already have enough on my plate as is. So I need people who are going to support the things that I&#8217;m doing.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Trink addressed the recent settlement with eSports Turner \u201cTfue\u201d Tenny after a 15-month legal dispute over his contract and sponsorship deals and discussed how the group was hoping to keep its athletes happy with their contracts.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re continuing to reexamine contracts as we go because this industry is moving at such a pace that it requires that so we do an audit on on what what our contracts have in them and what are the rights, what are the obligations, and we do that review a couple of times a year and have the opportunity as contracts are expiring, we&#8217;re doing new ones and there&#8217;s another opportunity to say do we have it right?&#8221; Trink said.<\/p>\n<p>Trink says the industry is progressing so quickly and that it isn&#8217;t always easy to &#8220;get things perfect.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;My philosophy around FaZe Clan and the industry is different than it was a year ago, it&#8217;s different than it was even six months ago,&#8221; Trink says. &#8220;You know, we&#8217;re really living in like dog years here.

on the orientation of your phone. With other Quibi shows, you\u2019re essentially getting two views of the same footage \u2014 but with \u201cWireless\u201d (which is executive produced by Steven Soderbergh), you\u2019re switching between traditional cinematic footage (in landscape) and a view of the protagonist\u2019s phone (in portrait).<\/p>\n<p>In this bonus episode of the Original Content podcast, director Zach Wechter told me that he and his co-writer Jack Seidman wrote the initial script \u2014 about a college student played by Tye Sheridan who gets trapped in the snow after a car crash, with only his iPhone to save him \u2014 before they decided on the phone-centric format. But when they heard about Turnstyle, \u201cIt just felt like a match made in heaven that would allow us to facilitate this idea.\u201d<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>I wondered whether that required going back and adding a bunch of phone interactions to the story, but said Wechter said, \u201cIt was quite the opposite. One thing we found in testing was when the phone plot moved really fast, it would be hard, because there are these two perspectives happening at once.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So that actually meant \u201creducing some fo the intriacy of the plot happening on the phone\u201d to ensure that viewers didn\u2019t get lost.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/t3hYvsV2i10?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>And if you\u2019re wondering which mode to focus on as you watch, Wechter has some simple advice: \u201cGo with your gut.\u201d He said he had a \u201croadmap\u201d for when he was hoping to nudge viewers to turn their phones \u2014 like when there\u2019s a notification sound or Sheridan focuses on his phone \u2014 \u201cbut I think the most important part of the experience is that we\u2019re not indicating when our viewers turn, that it becomes this sort of passive-but-active viewing experience.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Wechter described making the show \u2014 essentially a feature length film divided into episodes of 10 minutes or less \u2014 as shooting \u201ctwo films that had to dance together\u201d in just 19 days. And he made things even more challenging by insisting that all the phone\/FaceTime calls and even the text messages be filmed live, rather than just recording both ends separately.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I think about directing and my job, really the most fundamental part of it to me is making the actorss comfortable, and I think that having a scene partner is paramount,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a long conversation about why we couldn\u2019t just have them act off of a recording and shoot it separately \u2014 because it took a lot of logistical effort and resources to do it \u2014 but it really makes the scenes feel very alive and realistic.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>You can listen to the full interview in the player below, <a href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/original-content\/id1271763098\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">subscribe using Apple Podcasts<\/a>\u00a0or find us in your podcast player of choice.

But on this record \u2014 while the government has established that China\u2019s activities raise significant national- security concerns \u2014 it has put in scant little evidence that its effective ban of WeChat for all U.S. users addresses those concerns. And, as the plaintiffs point out, there are obvious alternatives to a complete ban, such as barring WeChat from government devices, as Australia has done, or taking other steps to address data security.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Given the likelihood of a lawsuit proceeding and the immediate damage a ban would have if implemented, the judge initiated a nationwide injunction against implementation of the Commerce Department\u2019s order to ban the app.<\/p>\n<p>Commerce will have a chance to respond to this development, and whether it chooses to edit its order, pursue other avenues through the courts, or just rescind the order entirely, we will see in the coming days.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A few days ago, the U.S. Commerce Department published a series of rules that aimed to block the downloading of TikTok and WeChat by American users, following an executive order signed by President Trump back in August.

One was innovative, one made clones. One was a free market while the other demanded payments to a political party and its leadership, a corrupt wealth generating scam that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/business\/global\/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html\">by some estimates<\/a> has netted top leaders billions of dollars. One kept the talent borders porous acting as a magnet for the world\u2019s top brains while the other interviewed you in a backroom at the airport before imprisoning you on sedition charges (okay, that might have been both).<\/p>\n<p>The comparison was always facile yes, but it was easy and at least directionally accurate if failing on the specifics.<\/p>\n<p>Now though, the country that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2019\/04\/lithium-ion-batteries-amazon-are-exploding\/587005\/\">exported exploding batteries<\/a> is pioneering quantum computing, while the country that pioneered the internet <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/03\/made-in-america-is-on-government-life-support-and-the-prognosis-isnt-good\/\">now builds planes that fall out of the sky<\/a> (and good news, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/boeing-flags-additional-787-production-problem-11599577936\">we\u2019ve identified even more planes<\/a> that might fall out of the sky at an airport near you!)<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tiktok\">TikTok\u2019s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> success is many things, but it is quite frankly just an embarrassment for the United States. There are thousands of entrepreneurs and hundreds of venture capitalists swarming Silicon Valley and the other American innovation hubs looking for the next great social app or building it themselves. But the power law of user growth and investor returns happens to reside in Haidian, Beijing. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/bytedance\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"bytedance\">ByteDance <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> through its local apps in China and overseas apps like TikTok <i>is<\/i> the consumer investor return of the past decade (there\u2019s a reason why all the IPOs this seasons are enterprise SaaS).<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a win that you can\u2019t chalk up just to industrial policy. Unlike in semiconductors or other capital-intensive industries where Beijing can offer billions in incentives to spur development, ByteDance builds apps. It distributes them on app stores across the world. It has exactly the same tools available to it that every entrepreneur with an Apple Developer account has access to. There is no <a href=\"https:\/\/www.csis.org\/analysis\/made-china-2025\">Made in China 2025<\/a> plan to build and popularize a consumer app like TikTok (you literally can\u2019t plan for consumer success like that). Instead, it\u2019s a well-executed product that\u2019s addictive to hundreds of millions of people.<\/p>\n<p>So much as China protected its industry from overseas competitors like Google and Amazon through market-entry barriers, America is now protecting its entrenched incumbents from overseas competitors like TikTok. We\u2019re demanding joint ventures and local cloud data sovereignty just as the Communist Party has demanded for years.<\/p>\n<p>Hell, we\u2019re apparently demanding a $5 billion tax payment from ByteDance, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-09-20\/trump-wants-5-billion-from-tiktok-deal-for-new-history-project\">which the president says will fund patriotic education for youth<\/a>. The president says a lot of things of course, but at least the $5 billion price point has been confirmed by Oracle in its press release over night (what the tax revenue will <i>actually<\/i> be used for is anyone\u2019s guess). If you followed the recent Hong Kong protests for a long time, you will remember that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-hongkong-patriotism\/hong-kong-frets-over-china-model-patriotic-education-idUSBRE86A09L20120711\">patriotic youth education<\/a> was some of the original tinder for those demonstrations back in 2012. What comes around, goes around, I guess.<\/p>\n<p>Development economists like to talk about \u201ccatch-up\u201d strategies, tactics that countries can take to avoid the middle income trap and cut the gap between the West and the rest. But what we need now are developed economists to explain America\u2019s \u201cfall behind\u201d strategy. Because we are falling behind, in pretty much everything.<\/p>\n<p>As the TikTok process and the earlier Huawei imbroglio show, America is no longer on the leading edge of technology in many key strategic markets. Mainland Chinese companies are globally winning in areas as diverse as 5G and social networks, and without direct government intervention to kill that innovation, American and European tech purveyors would have lost those markets entirely (and even <i>with<\/i> those interventions, they may still lose them). In Taiwan, TSMC has come from behind Intel to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/051b2c80-d53b-410e-8e80-f433d25a82dd\">take a year or two lead<\/a> in the fabrication of the most advanced semiconductors.<\/p>\n<p>I mean, we can\u2019t even pilfer Chinese history and mythology and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/21428088\/mulan-review-disney-live-action-remake\">turn it into a decent god damn film<\/a> these days.<\/p>\n<p>And the fall-behind strategy continues. Immigration restrictions from an administration hell-bent on destroying the single greatest source of American innovation, coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic, have fused into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/international-student-enrollment-trump-covid19-5caad69c-f6d4-4b79-bfb4-7b6ed038bc5b.html\">the largest single drop in international student migration in American history<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Why does that matter? In the U.S. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.insidehighered.com\/quicktakes\/2017\/10\/11\/foreign-students-and-graduate-stem-enrollment\">according to relatively recent data<\/a>, 81% of electrical engineering grad students are international, 79% in computer science are, and in most engineering and technical fields, the number hovers above a majority.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s great to believe the fantasy that if only these international grad students would stay home, then \u201creal\u201d Americans would somehow take these slots. But what\u2019s true of the strawberry pickers and food service workers is also true for EE grad students: proverbial \u201cAmericans\u201d don\u2019t want these jobs. They are hard jobs, thankless jobs, and require a ridiculous tenacity that American workers and students by and large don\u2019t have. These industries have huge contingents of foreign workers precisely because no one domestic wants to take these roles.<\/p>\n<p>So goes the talent, so goes the innovation. Without this wellspring of brainpower lodging itself in America\u2019s top innovation hubs, where exactly do we think it will go? That former aspiring Stanford or MIT computer scientist with ideas in his or her brain isn\u2019t just going to sit by the window gazing at the horizon waiting for the moment when they can enter the gilded halls of the U.S. of A. It\u2019s the internet era, and they are just going to get started on their dreams wherever they are, using whatever tools and resources they have available to them.<\/p>\n<p>All you have to do is look at the recent YC batches and realize that the future cohorts of great startups are going to increasingly come from outside the continental 48. Dozens of smart, brilliant entrepreneurs aren\u2019t even trying to migrate, instead rightfully seeing their home markets as more open to innovation and technological progress than the vaunted superpower. The frontier is closed here, and it has moved elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>So what are we left with here in the U.S. and increasingly Europe? A narrow-minded policy of blocking external tech innovation to ensure that our sclerotic and entrenched incumbents don\u2019t have to compete with the best in the world. If that isn\u2019t a recipe for economic disaster, I don\u2019t know what is.<\/p>\n<p>But hey: at least the youth will be patriotic.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It used to be \u201ceasy\u201d to tell the American and Chinese economies apart.

Windows.<\/p>\n<p>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, better known as CISA, issued an alert <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cisa.gov\/blog\/2020\/09\/18\/windows-server-vulnerability-requires-immediate-attention\">late on Friday<\/a> requiring all federal departments and agencies to &#8220;immediately&#8221; patch any Windows servers vulnerable to the so-called Zerologon attack by Monday, citing an &#8220;unacceptable risk&#8221; to government networks.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the third emergency alert issued by CISA this year.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/portal.msrc.microsoft.com\/en-US\/security-guidance\/advisory\/CVE-2020-1472\">Zerologon vulnerability<\/a>, rated the maximum 10.0 in severity, could allow an attacker to take control of any or all computers on a vulnerable network, including domain controllers, the servers that manage a network&#8217;s security. The bug was appropriately called &#8220;Zerologon,&#8221; because an attacker doesn&#8217;t need to steal or use any network passwords to gain access to the domain controllers, only gain a foothold on the network, such as by exploiting a vulnerable device connected to the network.<\/p>\n<p>With complete access to a network, an attacker could deploy malware, ransomware, or steal sensitive internal files.<\/p>\n<p>Security company Secura, which <a href=\"https:\/\/www.secura.com\/blog\/zero-logon\">discovered the bug<\/a>, said it takes &#8220;about three seconds in practice&#8221; to exploit the vulnerability.<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft pushed out an initial fix in August to prevent exploitation. But given the complexity of the bug, Microsoft said it would have to roll out a second patch early next year to eradicate the issue completely.<\/p>\n<p>But the race is on to patch systems after researchers reportedly released proof-of-concept code, potentially allowing attackers use the code to launch attacks. CISA said that Friday that it &#8220;assumes active exploitation of this vulnerability is occurring in the wild.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Although the CISA alert only applies to federal government networks, the agency said it &#8220;strongly&#8221; urges companies and consumers to patch their systems as soon as possible if not already.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"EQQzt321D9\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/08\/as-ransomware-gets-craftier-companies-must-start-thinking-creatively\/\">As ransomware gets craftier, companies must start thinking creatively<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;As ransomware gets craftier, companies must start thinking creatively&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/08\/as-ransomware-gets-craftier-companies-must-start-thinking-creatively\/embed\/#?secret=EQQzt321D9\" data-secret=\"EQQzt321D9\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Homeland Security&#8217;s cybersecurity advisory unit has issued a rare emergency alert to government departments after the recent disclosure of a &#8220;critical&#8221;-rated security vulnerability in server versions of Microsoft Windows.

Experiments at CERN generate colossal amounts of data (the LHC experiments produce over 30 petabytes of data per year). The Data Centre stores it, and sends it around the world for analysis.

CERN does not have the computing or financial resources to crunch all of the data on site, so in 2002 it turned to grid computing to share the burden with computer centres around the world.

weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It\u2019s broadly based on <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/the-exchange\/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but free, and made for your weekend reading.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ready? Let\u2019s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2>Was Snowflake\u2019s IPO mispriced or just misunderstood?<\/h2>\n<p>With an ocean of neat stuff to get through below, we\u2019ll be quick today on our thought bubble focused on Snowflake\u2019s IPO. Up front it was a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/jfrog-and-snowflakes-aggressive-ipo-pricing-point-to-strong-demand-for-cloud-shares\/\">huge success as a fundraising event<\/a> for the data-focused unicorn.<\/p>\n<p>At issue is the mismatch between the company\u2019s final IPO price of $120 and where it opened, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/go-public-now-while-software-valuations-make-no-sense-part-ii\/\">which was around $245 per share<\/a>. The usual forces were out on Twitter arguing that billions were left on the table, with commentary on the question of a mispriced IPO even reaching <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/09\/17\/snowflakes-first-day-pop-means-ipo-left-3point8-billion-on-the-table-the-most-in-12-years.html\">our friends at CNBC<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>A good question given the controversy is how the company itself felt about its IPO price given that it was the party that, theoretically, left a few billion on some metaphorical table. As it turns out, the CEO does not give a shit.<\/p>\n<p>Alex Konrad at Forbes &#8212; a good chap, follow him on Twitter <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/alexrkonrad\">here<\/a> &#8212; caught up <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/alexkonrad\/2020\/09\/17\/snowflake-ceo-frank-slootman-talks-ipo-pop-narrative-of-lost-billions-is-nonsense-talk\/#79e69e937d1d\">with Snowflake CEO Frank Slootman about the matter<\/a>. He called the \u201cchatter\u201d that his company left money on the table \u201cnonsense,\u201d adding that he could have priced higher but that he \u201cwanted to bring along the group of investors that [Snowflake] wanted, and [he] didn\u2019t want to push them past the point where they really started to squeal.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So Slootman found a new, higher price at which to value his company during its debut. He got the investors he wanted. He got Berkshire and Salesforce in on the deal. And the company roared out of the gate. What an awful, terrible, no-good, mess of an IPO.<\/p>\n<p>Adding to the mix, I <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/18\/3-investors-discuss-the-state-of-saas-investing-in-2020\/\">was chatting with a few SaaS VCs earlier this week<\/a>, and they largely didn\u2019t buy into the money-left-on-the-table argument, as presuming that a whole block of shares could be sold at the opening trade price is silly. Are IPOs perfect? Hell no. Are bankers out for their own good? Yes. But that doesn\u2019t mean that Snowflake screwed up.<\/p>\n<h2>Market Notes<\/h2>\n<p>No time to waste at all, let\u2019s get into it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lots of IPOs this week, and everyone did well. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/go-public-now-while-software-valuations-make-no-sense-part-ii\/\">Snowflake was explosive while JFrog was merely amazing<\/a>. Sumo Logic and Unity had more modest debuts, but good results all the same. Notes from JFrog and Sumo execs in a moment.<\/li>\n<li>Disrupt was a big damn deal this week, with tech\u2019s famous and its up and coming leaders showing up to chatter with TechCrunch about what\u2019s going on today, and what\u2019s going on tomorrow. You can catch up on the sessions here, which I recommend. But I wanted to take a moment and thank the TechCrunch sales, partnership, and events teams. They killed it and get 0.1% of the love that they deserve. Thank you.<\/li>\n<li>Why is Snowflake special? This <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jrichlive\/status\/1306602971698884608\">tweet by GGV\u2019s Jeff Richards<\/a> has the story in one chart.<\/li>\n<li>What are the hottest categories for SaaS startups in 2020? <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/which-5-cloud-startup-categories-are-the-hottest\/\">We got you<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>There\u2019s a new VC metric in town for startups to follow. Folks will recall the infamous T2D3 model, where startups should triple twice, and then double three times. That five-year plan got most companies to $100M in ARR. Now Shasta Ventures\u2019 <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ijroth?lang=en\">Issac Roth<\/a> has a new model for contention, what he\u2019s calling \u201cC170R,\u201d and according to a piece from his firm, he reckons it could be the \u201cnew post-COVID SaaS standard.\u201d (<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/10\/whats-driving-api-powered-startups-forward-in-2020\/\">We spoke with Roth about API-focused startups the other day<\/a>.)<\/li>\n<li>So what is it? Per his own notes: \u201cIf a startup entering COVID season with $2-20M in revenue is on track for 170% of their 2019 revenue AND is aligned with the new normal of remote, they will be able to raise new capital on good terms and are set up for future venture success.\u201d He goes to note that there\u2019s less of a need to double or treble this year.<\/li>\n<li>Our thought bubble: If this catches on, a lot more SaaS startups would prove eligible for new rounds than we\u2019d thought. And as Shasta <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/03\/shasta-ventures-debuts-ignite-a-collection-of-help-and-services-to-drive-its-startups-to-10m-arr\/\">is all-in on SaaS<\/a>, perhaps this metric is a welcome mat of sorts. I wonder what portion of VCs agree with Shasta\u2019s new model?<\/li>\n<li>And, closing, our <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/as-low-code-startups-continue-to-attract-vc-interest-whats-driving-customer-demand\/\">dive into no-code and low-code startups continues<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Various and Sundry<\/h2>\n<p>Again, there\u2019s so much to get to that there is no space to waste words. Onward:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chime <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/18\/chime-adds-485m-at-a-14-5b-valuation-claims-ebitda-profitability\/\">raised an ocean of capital<\/a>, which is notable for a few reasons. First, a new $14.5B valuation, which is up a zillion percent from their early 2019 round, and up around 3x from its late 2019 round. And it claims real EBITDA profitability. And with the company claiming it will be IPO ready in 12 months I am hype about the company. Because not every company that manages a big fintech valuation is in great shape.<\/li>\n<li>I got on the phone with the CEO and CFO of <a href=\"https:\/\/jfrog.com\/\">JFrog<\/a> after their IPO this week to chat about the offering. The pair looked at every IPO that happened during COVID, they said, to try to get their company to a \u201cfair price,\u201d adding that from here out the market will decide what\u2019s the right number. The CEO Shlomi Ben Haim also made a fun allusion to a tweet comparing JFrog\u2019s opening valuation to the price that Microsoft paid for GitHub. <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dwk24\/status\/1306259134598217728\">I think that this is the tweet<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>JFrog\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/31\/frugal-startups-should-pay-attention-to-how-jfrogs-ipo-prices\/\">pricing came on the back of it making money<\/a>, i.e. real GAAP net income in its most recent quarter. According to JFrog\u2019s CFO Jacob Shulman \u201cinvestors were impressed with the numbers,\u201d and were also impressed by its \u201cefficient market model\u201d that allowed it find \u201cviral adoption inside the enterprise.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>That last phrase sounds to us like efficient sales and marketing spend.<\/li>\n<li>Moving to Sumo Logic, which also went out this week (<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/24\/unpacking-the-sumo-logic-s-1-filing\/\">S-1 notes here<\/a>). I caught up with the company\u2019s CTO Christian Beedgen.<\/li>\n<li>Beedgen, I just want to say, is a delight to chat with. But more on topic, the company\u2019s IPO went well and I wanted to dig into more of the nitty-gritty of the market that Sumo is seeing. After Beedgen walked me through how he views his company\u2019s TAM ($50 billion) and market dynamics (not winner-takes-all), I asked about sales friction amongst enterprise customers that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/09\/slacks-earnings-detail-how-covid-19-is-both-a-help-and-a-hindrance-to-cloud-growth\/\">Slack had mentioned in its most recent earnings report<\/a>. Beedgen said:<\/li>\n<li>\u201cI don&#8217;t see that as a systemic problem personally. [&#8230;] I think people in economies are very flexible, and you know the new normal is what it is now. And you know these other guys on the other side [of the phone], these businesses they also need to continue to run their stuff and so they&#8217;re gonna continue to figure out how we can help. And they will find us, we will find them. I really don&#8217;t see that as a systemic problem.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>So, good news for enterprise startups everywhere!<\/li>\n<li>Wix <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/wix-announces-wix-capital-internal-venture-arm-to-invest-in-global-startups-301132052.html\">launched<\/a> a non-VC fund that looks a bit like a VC fund. Called Wix Capital, the group will \u201cinvest in technology innovators that are focused on the future of the web and that look to accelerate how businesses operate in today&#8217;s evolving digital landscape,\u201d per the company.<\/li>\n<li>Wix is a big public shop these days, with elements of low and no-code to its core. (The Exchange <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/15\/liquid-unicorns-accelerating-transitions-and-gen-zs-venture-impact\/\">talked to the company not too long ago<\/a>.)<\/li>\n<li>And, finally my friends, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JoeVennare\/status\/1306612583768690689\">I call this the Peloton Effect<\/a>, and am going to write about it if I can find the time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I am chatting with a Unity exec this evening, but too late to make it into this newsletter. Perhaps next week. Hugs until then, and stay safe.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/alex\">Alex<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter.

For many growers, large and small, this consists of constant data entry from seed to sale. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.canix.com\/\">Canix\u2019s solution<\/a>\u00a0employs a robust enterprise resource planning platform with a steep tilt toward reducing the time it takes to input data. This platform integrates nicely with common bookkeeping software and Metrc, an industry-wide regulatory platform, through the use of RFID scanners and Bluetooth-enabled scales. Canix\u00a0launched in June 2019, and in a little over a year (and during a pandemic), acquired over 300 customers spanning more than 1,000 growing facilities and tracking the movement of 2.5 million plants.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Next, here&#8217;s an especially pithy take on the future of startups, from senior Benchmark partner Peter Fenton.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I think this opportunity to build the tools for a world that\u2019s \u2018post place\u2019 has just opened up and is as exciting as anything I\u2019ve seen in my venture career. You walk around right now and you see these ghosts towns, with gyms, classes you might take [and so forth] and now maybe you go online and do Peloton, or that class you maybe do online.

At one point this week, it looked like Oracle and various business interests had a plan to keep Tik Tok alive as an independent company that would IPO (with some sort of national security oversight), and maybe that will still come about? I doubt Trump and his advisers will go along with that plan, given the national security problem of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/tiktok-rumors-beg-the-question-did-trump-solve-anything\/\">leaving algorithms controlled from China<\/a>, and the long-term trade problem of US consumer tech being banned there too.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Bytedance-owned company also just announced <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/tiktok-hits-100m-users-in-europe-as-the-clock-ticks-on-its-us-business\/\">100 million users in Europe<\/a>.

The issue is that Google has reportedly seen more posts being flagged for racism or abuse on its message boards. Some of these posts reportedly reinforce negative racial stereotypes, use harmful gendered phrases of insult Google employees based on their nationality. Here&#8217;s a snippet from Google&#8217;s internal blog, via CNBC:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cOur world is going to get more complicated as the year continues,\u201d the team stated in the internal blog. \u201cTensions continue specifically for our Black+ community with Black Lives Matter, and our Asian Googlers with coronavirus and China\/Hong Kong. All of this is compounded by the additional stress of working from home, social isolation, and caregiver responsibilities \u2014 to name a few. This new world creates urgency to keep work a welcoming place.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Yes, tough conversations are the theme of the year. But we also know Google has had issues with employees before. You may remember James Damore, the now former Google employee who <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/08\/05\/theres-an-anti-diversity-manifesto-circulating-around-google\/?_ga=2.179904289.44533313.1600097840-1057749772.1591641289\">sent around an anti-diversity manifesto back in 2017<\/a>. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/08\/05\/theres-an-anti-diversity-manifesto-circulating-around-google\/?_ga=2.179904289.44533313.1600097840-1057749772.1591641289\">Google ultimately fired Damore that same month<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>We reached out to Google for comment but have not heard back.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Kerry Washington on The Wing scandal<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>At TechCrunch Disrupt, I had the pleasure of virtually interviewing Kerry Washington, best known for her work in Hollywood as the lead actress on &#8220;Scandal&#8221; and &#8220;Little Fires Everywhere.&#8221; But she&#8217;s also invested in a handful of tech companies, including Community, Byte and The Wing. The Wing, however, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/03\/17\/magazine\/the-wing.html\">went through some turmoil earlier this year<\/a>. Employees alleged mistreatment of Black and brown workers, which ultimately led to The Wing CEO Audrey Gelman&#8217;s resignation.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Well, you know, I&#8217;m not new to scandal, so there&#8217;s that,&#8221; Washington told me in response to a question about her reaction to the news. &#8220;I was and I am really deeply still inspired by the original vision of the company. And, I think like a lot of companies in this time, because of the several pandemics that we&#8217;re facing, whether it&#8217;s our awareness around racial injustice, or COVID, lots of people are in a moment of recalibration and self-reflection. So I think that there is incredible space to improve the dynamics. And as somebody who\u2019s an investor, as a woman of color, it\u2019s important to me that there is increased transparency and also accountability.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Over the past few months, Washington said her role as an investor has been \u201creally just supporting leadership in this transition,\u201d as well as expressing to those leaders a \u201cdeep desire\u201d for transparency and accountability.<\/p>\n<p><strong>On imposter syndrome and representation\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Also at Disrupt, my homegirl Kirsten Korosec led a wonderful <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/the-art-of-pivoting-with-phaedra-ellis-lamkins-and-jessica-matthews\/\">conversation with Phaedra Ellis-Lamkins of PromisePay and Jessica Matthews of Uncharted Power<\/a>, two Black female founders, about how they both successfully pivoted their companies while navigating the pressures that come with being an underrepresented founder in Silicon Valley.<\/p>\n<p>Phaedra Ellis-Lamkins, founder and CEO at PromisePay:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>It feels like tech has failed so significantly in investing in people they don\u2019t know and missed out in growing companies because of that. So I think our obligation is to help make sure that we are not the only ones.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Jessica Matthews, founder and CEO at Uncharted Power:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>It\u2019s not imposter syndrome, it\u2019s representation syndrome because I feel the exact same way. When we raised our Series A, the immediate thing I thought was, \u2018Oh, man. I can not lose these people\u2019s money.\u2019 This is huge and if we don\u2019t work, it\u2019s not even about us, it\u2019s about every other person who looks like me.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Michael Seibel on the Black founder experience<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" data-sheets-userformat=\"{&quot;2&quot;:14915,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:[null,2,1711393],&quot;9&quot;:0,&quot;12&quot;:0,&quot;14&quot;:[null,2,13750995],&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;16&quot;:11}\">\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f5fca7041d66f2b574812da\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In a panel on the Black founder experience at Disrupt, Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel spoke about a &#8220;hidden burden&#8221; for underrepresented founders.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I think that there&#8217;s so much deserved activism around access to this world for underrepresented founders, that I feel as though there&#8217;s like, more pressure to succeed, in a weird way,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And I think that can be helpful to a point, but I think that it can be challenging. I also think that there&#8217;s so much emphasis around the toxicity in the technology world that a lot of really talented people believe it&#8217;s horrible, like believe that our world looks like Jim Crow South. And so therefore they shouldn&#8217;t even step any foot into it where like, I would challenge anyone trying to be successful in any industry to be able to avoid the types of problems that exists in the technology industry, if they come from an underrepresented background. <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">So I don&#8217;t think the environment&#8217;s significantly different in our world than other worlds. I think that the environment is hard. You know, there is bias if you&#8217;re underrepresented, across the board, no matter what industry you go to. So if you&#8217;re gonna be successful, you&#8217;re going to figure out a way to get around it.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s not to say you&#8217;ll have to figure it out on your own, Seibel said. He pointed to how there are people who are willing and able to help. That includes him and the many other Black founders present in Silicon Valley.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">&#8220;But if we somehow scare talented people away from this world, we won&#8217;t ever fix this world,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And we won&#8217;t ever, even more importantly than fixing this world, there&#8217;ll be huge swaths of the world that don&#8217;t have products and services that they deserve and that they need. And so I think we have to be careful to make sure we communicate that opportunities exist here. And that if you&#8217;re trying to be a high powered lawyer, or if you&#8217;re trying to be, you know, a top banker, you&#8217;re gonna go through the same bullshit. Like, different industries, same bullshit. So if you&#8217;re trying to make an impact in the world, strap in. If you&#8217;re an underrepresented founder, you&#8217;re gonna have to deal with these issues, no matter where you do it.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Don&#8217;t miss<\/h2>\n<hr \/>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/15\/black-tech-pipeline-proves-the-pipeline-problem-isnt-real\/\">Black Tech Pipeline proves the \u2018pipeline problem\u2019 isn\u2019t real<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.educationdive.com\/news\/ibm-plans-100m-investment-in-hbcu-computing-program\/585374\/?utm_source=What+We%27re+Reading&amp;utm_campaign=26feb0fac7-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_09_18_04_58&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_a000bf097a-26feb0fac7-414321844\">IBM plans $100M investment in HBCU computing program<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/amazon-looks-more-contractors-grocery-003301659.html\">Amazon Looks to Use More Contractors for Grocery Delivery<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome back to Human Capital, where we unpack all-things diversity, inclusion and labor in tech.

On to a shot of a sofa in a living room. It&#8217;s empty. The camera inclines toward a radio on a sidetable. Should we be worried for the invisible occupant? The staging invites cryptic questions.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Cut to an outdoor scene: A massive tree spreading above a wrought iron park fence. Another overcast day in the city. Beside it an eccentric shock of orange. A piece of public art? A glass-blown installation? There&#8217;s no time to investigate or interrogate. The AI is moving on. There&#8217;s more data clogging its banks.\u00a0<\/em><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><em>Cut to a conference speaker. White, male, besuited, he&#8217;s gesticulating against a navy wall stamped with some kind of insignia. The photo is low quality, snapped in haste from the audience, details too fuzzy to pick out. <\/em><em>Still, the camera lingers, panning across the tedious vista. A wider angle shows conference signage for something called &#8216;Health X&#8217;. This long distant press event rings a dim bell. Another unlovely crop: My voice recorder beside a brick wall next to an iced coffee. I guess I&#8217;m working from a coffee shop. <\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>On we go. A snap through a window-frame of a well kept garden, a bird-bath sprouting from low bushes. Another shot of the shrubbery shows a ladder laid out along a brick wall. I think it looks like a church garden in Southwark but I honestly can&#8217;t tell. No matter. The AI has lost interest. Now it&#8217;s obsessing over a billboard of a Google Play ad: &#8220;All the tracks you own and millions more to discover &#8212; Try it now for free,&#8221; the text reads above a weathered JCDecaux brand stamp. <\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>There&#8217;s no time to consider what any of this means because <\/em><em><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">suddenly it&#8217;s nighttime. It must be; my bedside lamp is lit. Or is it? Now we&#8217;re back on the living room sofa with daylight and a book called &#8216;Nikolski&#8217; (which is also, as it happens, about separation and connection and random artefacts &#8212; although its artful narrative succeeds in serendipity). <\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Cut to a handful of berries in a cup.

For the finale: A poorly framed crop of a garden fence and a patio of pot plants, washing weeping behind the foliage. The music is fading, the machine is almost done constructing its London trip. The last shot gets thrust into view: Someone&#8217;s hand clasping a half-drunk punch.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Go home algorithm, you&#8217;re drunk.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">My iPhone has invented a 2014 &#39;London trip&#39; that wasn&#39;t.

Typically, developers are given a much longer heads-up and at least have the updated version of their developer tools well before the actual iOS launch day. This year, however, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/apple-burns-developer-goodwill-with-surprise-release-of-ios-14\/\">Apple shocked app developers<\/a> with an announcement during its live event that its new software platforms, iOS 14, iPadOS 14, watchOS 7 and tvOS 14, would arrive in less than 24 hours.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"TZgmaYJPlk\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/apple-burns-developer-goodwill-with-surprise-release-of-ios-14\/\">Apple burns developer goodwill with surprise release of iOS 14<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Apple burns developer goodwill with surprise release of iOS 14&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/apple-burns-developer-goodwill-with-surprise-release-of-ios-14\/embed\/#?secret=TZgmaYJPlk\" data-secret=\"TZgmaYJPlk\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The move was a low blow from Apple at a time when its developer community was already feeling disrespected by Apple\u2019s tougher stance on the use of in-app purchases and increase in capricious app rejections, not to mention the language Apple used to describe their contributions to iPhone\u2019s success in Apple\u2019s lawsuit with Epic Games.<\/p>\n<p>But now <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/ios-14-is-now-available-to-download\/\">iOS 14 is here<\/a>, and with it comes a radical change to how apps are presented and used on iPhone.<\/p>\n<p>App Clips will allow users to launch \u201cmini app\u201d experiences when a full app download isn\u2019t needed, like in the case of needing to pay at a parking meter using a native app. Widgets will allow developers to increase their presence on the home screen, potentially increasing their importance to their most loyal users. But on the flip side, infrequently used apps may now be abandoned in the new App Library.<\/p>\n<p>Any app that doesn\u2019t get a home screen spot in the new version of iOS either as an app icon or widget may soon find that its MAUs and DAUs decline after users upgrade to iOS 14.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"NbD8zcZzFU\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/ios-14-widgets-you-can-try-today\/\">New iOS 14 widgets you can try today<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;New iOS 14 widgets you can try today&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/ios-14-widgets-you-can-try-today\/embed\/#?secret=NbD8zcZzFU\" data-secret=\"NbD8zcZzFU\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Being relegated to the App Library is the equivalent of being stuck inside a folder on the back screen \u2014 out of sight and forgotten. App developers who suspect they haven\u2019t made the cut in the big iOS redesign will need to make clever use of push notifications to rekindle their relationship with users. But this, too, is a fine line. Too many notifications or pushing low-value notifications will see users turning to other iOS tools &#8212; like the option to easily silence or switch off notifications entirely for the app in question. And then, without any visibility or a way to connect, the app will be truly forgotten.<\/p>\n<p>Apple also challenged the entire fitness app industry with <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/15\/apple-launches-fitness-subscription-service-for-just-under-80-a-year\/\">its launch of a Fitness+ subscription service<\/a>. Wall Street investors <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/15\/the-fitness-market-doesnt-seem-too-scared-by-apple-fitness\/\">weren\u2019t too worried<\/a> about the long-term potential impact to top brands, like Peloton and Fitbit. But these companies are not necessarily representative of the smaller fitness app maker. For $10 per month or just $80 per year, Apple is offering a home gym membership of sorts, with deep integrations with Apple Watch. Fitness+ offers workouts and instructions set to music that can be used across Apple devices. Because it&#8217;s from Apple, the workouts will also correctly sync to the Apple Watch for accurate recording of various workout metrics, like calories burned, pace or distance, for example.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"FjiJlk0EdJ\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/15\/the-fitness-market-doesnt-seem-too-scared-by-apple-fitness\/\">The fitness market doesn&#8217;t seem too scared by Apple Fitness+<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;The fitness market doesn&#8217;t seem too scared by Apple Fitness+&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/15\/the-fitness-market-doesnt-seem-too-scared-by-apple-fitness\/embed\/#?secret=FjiJlk0EdJ\" data-secret=\"FjiJlk0EdJ\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The service is also being bundled in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/newsroom\/2020\/09\/apple-one-makes-enjoying-apple-subscription-services-easier-than-ever\/\">Apple&#8217;s new Apple One subscription<\/a> in the upper tier, which may appeal to Apple&#8217;s current subscribers looking to save money by paying for an all-in-one service instead of individual apps. And what could a fitness app maker do to compete with this? Or a music app, for that matter? Third-parties don&#8217;t typically have the option to get bundled into a high-value package alongside other top apps from unrelated industries, unless the company goes out and forges those deals itself &#8212; like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/12\/hulu-and-spotify-launch-an-even-more-steeply-discounted-bundle-of-9-99-per-month\/\">Spotify once did with Hulu<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Given that Apple is still being investigated over antitrust issues, it&#8217;s rather bold to launch a bundle deal like this while continuing to commission its competitors &#8212; rivals who have no other means of reaching iPhone&#8217;s audience outside the App Store.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"thcQp3YpnB\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/15\/apple-one-bundles-icloud-music-tv-arcade-news-and-fitness-for-30-a-month\/\">Apple One bundles iCloud, Music, TV+, Arcade, News+ and Fitness+ for $30 a month<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Apple One bundles iCloud, Music, TV+, Arcade, News+ and Fitness+ for $30 a month&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/15\/apple-one-bundles-icloud-music-tv-arcade-news-and-fitness-for-30-a-month\/embed\/#?secret=thcQp3YpnB\" data-secret=\"thcQp3YpnB\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Another new Apple service puts family tracking apps on notice. Though apps like Life360 have become must-have tools in the helicopter parent era, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/newsroom\/2020\/09\/apple-extends-the-apple-watch-experience-to-the-entire-family\/\">Apple&#8217;s new Family Setup<\/a> aims to transform the kid-tracking industry by taking a different tactic: it&#8217;s for families who aren&#8217;t buying kids an iPhone just yet. Instead, Apple will lure new customers by making its Apple Watch &#8212; and specifically, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/newsroom\/2020\/09\/apple-watch-se-the-ultimate-combination-of-design-function-and-value\/\">more affordable Apple Watch SE<\/a> &#8212; kids&#8217; first Apple device.<\/p>\n<p>Kids get to use Apple Watch&#8217;s key features, like Emergency SOS, Maps, Siri, Alarms, Memoji, Apple Pay, and more, while parents get to restrict who the child can call or text. By the time the child upgrades to iPhone and the wider world of apps that comes with it, families may see no need for a third-party alternative for family safety. That means kid trackers will need to upgrade their offerings to include features that Apple doesn&#8217;t, like Life360 does with its driving features, like crash detection or weekly driver reports, for instance.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Continuing chaos around the TikTok ban<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>There is nothing straightforward about the TikTok ban. Like much of the Executive Order activity coming from the current administration, a broad order is issued but the details are left to be worked out on the fly, leading to chaos.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of the TikTok deal and the app&#8217;s potential ban in the U.S., at the beginning of this week we learned <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-china-bytedance-tiktok-exclusive-idUSKBN2622L6\">China would rather see TikTok banned<\/a> than forced into a sale, and that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/bytedance-wont-sell-tiktok-to-microsoft-or-oracle\/\">neither Oracle nor Microsoft<\/a> would get to acquire TikTok&#8217;s U.S. business. Microsoft was said to have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/microsoft-lost-tiktok-bidding-war-called-tiktok-security-risk-2020-9\">apparently<\/a> pissed off TikTok owner ByteDance by calling the app a security risk and was cut out of the deal. Later in the week, Oracle put out a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/oracle-confirms-statement-301130173.html\">press release<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/13\/oracle-wins-bid-to-buy-tiktok\/\">saying it would be the technology partner<\/a> for TikTok, and Walmart separately <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/walmart-in-talks-with-tiktok-as-oracle-deal-moves-forward-2020-9\">claimed<\/a> to still be involved.<\/p>\n<p>Oh, and it seems Instagram founder and former CEO Kevin Systrom was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/09\/17\/technology\/tiktok-deal-revisions-trump-review.html?smid=tw-share\">approached<\/a> for the TikTok CEO job at one point. Lord.<\/p>\n<p>So what&#8217;s happening now? The U.S. government and ByteDance <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/tiktok-rumors-beg-the-question-did-trump-solve-anything\/\">continue to negotiate on specific terms<\/a>. As of late, the U.S. wants Oracle to agree to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/report-oracle-proposed-tiktok-deal-includes-source-code-audit-2020-9\">review TikTok source code<\/a> for backdoors, ByteDance to create a new organization for its U.S. operations with a board approved by the U.S. government and for there to be a license agreement for TikTok&#8217;s algorithms. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/tiktok-rumors-beg-the-question-did-trump-solve-anything\/\">As TechCrunch reported<\/a>, these terms beg the question as to how TikTok could possibly continue to refine its algorithms in real time without access to U.S. TikTok user data, or when it has to rebuild its infrastructure on Oracle, separated from a core product being developed elsewhere. But nevertheless, reports claim ByteDance has agreed to the government&#8217;s terms and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/09\/17\/trump-to-rule-on-tiktok-deal-in-24-36-hours-oracle-to-take-20percent-stake.html\">also plans to IPO<\/a> TikTok&#8217;s global business.<\/p>\n<p>On Friday, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/18\/tiktok-and-wechat-will-be-banned-in-the-u-s-from-sunday\/\">the Commerce Dept. announced the details<\/a> of how it plans to enforce a shutdown, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.commerce.gov\/news\/press-releases\/2020\/09\/commerce-department-prohibits-wechat-and-tiktok-transactions-protect\">saying<\/a> that both TikTok and WeChat, the other Chinese app impacted by the ban, would no longer be distributed on U.S. app stores as of September 20. But TikTok gets an extension that allows it to still operate until November 12 as the parties attempt to hammer out the complicated deal. That deadline means the app will continue to work through the U.S. elections, based on how the terms are spelled out now. But those could change at any time, given the chaotic nature of how this potential ban has progressed so far.<\/p>\n<p>Despite being one of TikTok&#8217;s chief rivals, Instagram &#8212; which recently copied TikTok with its own feature, Reels &#8212; has come out against the ban. Instagram head Adam Mosseri said a U.S. ban of the app would be bad for the internet more broadly, including companies like Facebook and Instagram. TikTok interim CEO\u00a0 Vanessa Pappas then publicly <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/v_ness\/status\/1306956276761415681\">asked<\/a> him for help with its litigation.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We agree that this type of ban would be bad for the industry. We invite Facebook and Instagram to publicly join our challenge and support our litigation.

If the old-school roadshow survives, we&#8217;ll be surprised, though private jet companies will miss the business.<\/p>\n<p>Talking about the transaction itself, Jabal stressed the connection between her company&#8217;s employees, value\u00a0 and their access to that same value. Unity&#8217;s IPO was unique in that existing and former employees were able to trade 15% of their vested holdings in the company on day one, excluding &#8220;current executive officers and directors,&#8221; per SEC filings.<\/p>\n<p>That act does not seemed to have dampened enthusiasm for the company&#8217;s shares, and could have helped boost early float, allowing for the two sides of the supply and demand curves to more quickly meet close to the company&#8217;s real value, instead of a scarcity-driven, more artificial figure.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"t3pd4cIhcS\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/10\/bear-and-bull-cases-for-unitys-ipo\/\">Bear and bull cases for Unity&#8217;s IPO<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Bear and bull cases for Unity&#8217;s IPO&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/10\/bear-and-bull-cases-for-unitys-ipo\/embed\/#?secret=t3pd4cIhcS\" data-secret=\"t3pd4cIhcS\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Regarding Unity&#8217;s IPO pricing, Jabal discussed what she called a &#8220;very data-driven process.&#8221; The result of that process was an IPO price that came in above its raised range, and still rose during its first day&#8217;s trading, but less than 50%. That&#8217;s about as good an outcome as you can hope for in an IPO.<\/p>\n<p>One final thing for the SaaS nerds out there. Unity&#8217;s &#8220;dollar-based net expansion rate&#8221; went from very good to <em>outstanding<\/em> in 2020, or in the words of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1810806\/000119312520246641\/d908875ds1a.htm\">the S-1\/<\/a>A:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Our dollar-based net expansion rate, which measures expansion in existing customers\u2019 revenue over a trailing 12-month period, grew from 124% as of December 31, 2018 to 133% as of December 31, 2019, and from 129% as of June 30, 2019 to 142% as of June 30, 2020, demonstrating the power of this strategy.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>We had to ask. And the answer, per Jabal, was a combination of the company&#8217;s platform strength and how customers tend to use more of Unity&#8217;s services over time, which she described as growing with their customers. And the second key element was 2020&#8217;s unique dynamics that gave Unity a &#8220;tailwind&#8221; thanks to &#8220;increased usage, particularly in gaming.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Looking at our own gaming levels in 2020 compared to 2019, that checks out.<\/p>\n<p>This post closes the book on this week&#8217;s IPO class.

life,\u201d Conan O\u2019Brien explains, with a wry smile, \u201cthe success of the podcast was a complete surprise.\u201d The answer is a typically self-effacing one from the comedian. Since launching \u201cConan O\u2019Brien Needs a Friend\u201d nearly two years ago, the show has quickly risen up the podcasting charts to become one of the country\u2019s most popular.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">For those who have followed his 30-odd-year career in entertainment, it\u2019s easy to see why. Quick-witted and almost superhumanly affable, the transition to podcasting seems almost a given in retrospect. After all, hosting a series of late-night network talk shows for decades isn\u2019t exactly starting from scratch when it comes to launching a new entertainment venture. Nor, for that matter, is having tens of millions of Twitter followers and your own online media company, <a href=\"https:\/\/teamcoco.com\/\">Team Coco<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Not that things have always been easy. A long-promised Tonight Show slot wasn\u2019t all he\u2019d hoped for, leading to a very public exit from the most-coveted show in late night after just under eight months. It was the shortest tenure in the series\u2019 history, culminating in a televised \u201cexit interview\u201d with Steve Carrell that found The Office star shredding his NBC badge. But O\u2019Brien\u2019s late-night hiatus was short-lived. Later that year, he returned with TBS\u2019 Conan, which will celebrate its 10th year on the air in November (and is renewed at least through 2022).<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p class=\"p2\">The 2018 launch of \u201cConan O\u2019Brien Needs a Friend\u201d found the comedian embracing the new-found freedom of podcasting.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cThere are a couple of things about doing podcasts that are superior or more fun than doing a talk show,\u201d a quarantine-haired O\u2019Brien said in an interview at TechCrunch Disrupt this week. \u201cWhen I\u2019m doing the traditional talk show, I\u2019m limited. For years and years and years, when it was on network television, I had to take six- and seven-minute turns, which mean I\u2019m having a conversation with you or I\u2019m having a conversation with someone I\u2019ve always dreamed of talking to, whether it\u2019s Tom Hanks or Jim Carrey or Robin Williams. Then after six or seven minutes, there has to be a laugh and we\u2019ll take a break and we\u2019ll be right back.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cThat\u2019s not a natural conversational flow,\u201d he continues. \u201cWhat you can do with a podcast is really incredible. I can talk to someone for an hour and 15 minutes. We try and trim them back, but for the most part, people let their guard down. The other thing I prefer: no hair and makeup. It sounds like I&#8217;m kidding. But after almost 30 years of people caking my very white face with makeup so that I look like I&#8217;m still alive.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Team Coco has produced 10 shows in all, including shows from longtime sidekick Andy Richter and actor Rob Lowe, writers Mike Sweeney and Jessie Gaskel\u2019s intimately titled Inside Conan and a six-part mini-series interview with SNL alum, Dana Carvey.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cI don&#8217;t want to set a number goal,\u201d O\u2019Brien says. &#8220;I&#8217;m amazed &#8212; in two years, we&#8217;ve rolled out 10 different podcasts, some of them unscripted, but some scripted ones, as well. I&#8217;m not sitting around saying, &#8216;hey, we&#8217;ve got to get to 35 podcasts by this point.&#8217; Because I&#8217;d like them to be good.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">As my hair grows, so do my powers&#8230; <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/BqVGj4s8VI\">pic.twitter.com\/BqVGj4s8VI<\/a><\/p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\">&mdash; Conan O&#39;Brien (@ConanOBrien) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ConanOBrien\/status\/1306394457227456512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 17, 2020<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p class=\"p2\">The talk show has soldiered on, as well, undergoing its own transformations in the process.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">In 2019, the program was retooled for a half-hour format. O\u2019Brien dropped the desk and the suit, adopting a looser format perhaps inspired in part by the new freedoms afforded by his podcasting ventures. When COVID-19 made the in-person show an impossibility, he started working from home like so many others, switching to remote Zoom interviews. Throughout it all, \u201cConan O\u2019Brien Needs a Friend\u201d continued posting weekly interviews.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Asked whether he planned to continue his late-night show after the contract runs out in a couple of years, O\u2019Brien seemed unsure.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cI think it&#8217;s a mistake to think of it as, will you stop doing the show, and only do the podcast? Or will you retire and then quietly work on your letters in a shack? I love to create things. I have a lot of energy. I love to try and make people laugh. And so I see All of this converging, I think the message that I would have for everybody watching TechCrunch Disrupt right now is that people need to open up their minds a little bit. If I&#8217;m making podcasts, it doesn&#8217;t prohibit me from also maybe do maybe doing something, it doesn&#8217;t have to necessarily be for Turner, it could be for anybody.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2049129\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2049129\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2049129\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/conan-pill-form1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/conan-pill-form1.jpg 3200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/conan-pill-form1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/conan-pill-form1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/conan-pill-form1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/conan-pill-form1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/conan-pill-form1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/conan-pill-form1.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/conan-pill-form1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2049129\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Bryce Durbin<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Multiple decades of success, it seems, have put O\u2019Brien in the relatively unique position of being able to be somewhat platform-agnostic. Not being tied to a single medium is a strong place to be when it comes to bracing oneself for the unexpected technological changes that will continue to disrupt and upend the entertainment industry.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cFive years from now our entertainment may come in pill form,\u201d he says. \u201cYou could binge The Sopranos. You could just take a whole bottle of Sopranos and then just drink a lot of water and then, you know, just don&#8217;t need any red meat.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">&#8220;This is gonna sound far-fetched, but I think this is the most excited I&#8217;ve been in my career, because there were so many ways to be creative. There are so many ways to make people laugh, and I enjoy these new opportunities. I think when you\u2019re someone who has been around as long as I have, you have a choice.
