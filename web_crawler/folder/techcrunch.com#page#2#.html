The app returned to the store eight hours later, but the controversy and acrimony Google has stirred up in the country will linger for years.<\/p>\n<p>TechCrunch reported on Friday that Google pulled <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/paytm\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"paytm\">Paytm <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> app from its app store after a repeat pattern of violations of Google Play Store guidelines by the Indian firm.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Paytm, which is locked in a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/03\/google-and-walmarts-phonepe-establish-dominance-in-indias-mobile-payments-market-as-whatsapp-pay-struggles-to-launch\/\">battle against Google to win India\u2019s payments market<\/a>, has been frustrated at Google\u2019s policies &#8212; which it argues gives Google an unfair advantage &#8212; for several past quarters over how the Android-maker is limiting its marketing campaigns to acquire new users, sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>The explanation provided by Google to Paytm for why it pulled the Indian firm\u2019s app this week from its app store is the latest attempt by the company to thwart the Noida-headquartered firm\u2019s ability to acquire new users, Paytm executives said.<\/p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.paytm.com\/the-story-behind-paytm-apps-de-listing-from-google-play-store-42b3b6f54da0\">blog post<\/a> Paytm posted Sunday evening (local India time), the Indian firm said Google took issue with the company for giving customers cashbacks and scratch cards for initiating transactions over UPI, a government-backed payments infrastructure in India that has become the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/01\/upi-india-growth-startups-business-model\/\">most popular way for people to exchange money digitally in the country.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Paytm said it rolled out this new version of scratch cards that are linked to cricket on September 11. Users collected these cricket-themed stickers for sending money to others, or making transactions such as topping up credit on their phone or paying their broadband or electricity bill.<\/p>\n<p>In a statement on Sunday evening, a Google spokesperson said, \u201coffering cashbacks and vouchers alone do not constitute a violation of our Google Play gambling policies\u201d and that Play Store \u201cpolicies are applied and enforced on all developers consistently.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But it\u2019s arguably anything but consistent.<\/p>\n<p>On September 18, Google told Paytm that it had pulled its app for not complying with Play Store\u2019s \u201cgambling policy\u201d as it offered games with \u201cloyalty points.\u201d Paytm said that Google had not expressed any concerns over Paytm\u2019s new marketing campaign prior to its notice on Friday, in which it revealed that Paytm app had been temporarily removed from the Play Store.<\/p>\n<p>But Google itself is running a similar campaign linked to cricket in India, Paytm argues. (Why cricket? Cricket is immensely popular in India and one of the biggest cricket tournaments globally, Indian Premier League, kicked off its latest season on Saturday.)<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2049284\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2049284\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2049284 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"286\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg 3284w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=150,42 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=300,84 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=768,214 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=680,190 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=1536,428 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=2048,571 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=50,14 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2049284\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cricket-themed cashback offered by Paytm (left) and Google Pay (right) in India<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Google Play Store in India has long prohibited apps that promote gambling such as betting on sporting events, and Google has raised concerns about Paytm&#8217;s marquee app promoting Paytm First Games, a fantasy sports app run by Paytm, in the past.<\/p>\n<p>Paytm executives argued that <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/phonepe\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"phonepe\">PhonePe, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> a Walmart-owned payments app in India, also promoted Dream11, the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/indian-fantasy-sports-app-dream11s-parent-firm-raises-225m-at-over-2-5b-valuation\/\">most popular fantasy sports app in the country<\/a>, and got away without any action.<\/p>\n<p>Google also permits fantasy sports app operators &#8212; including Paytm &#8212; to advertise on Search in India.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-theme=\"light\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Where is Google hypocritical?

The removal of Paytm app was only on the grounds of Paytm offering cricket-themed cashback, he claimed. \u201cGoogle is not allowing us to acquire new customers right now. That\u2019s all what this is,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s payments app, Google Pay, competes with Paytm in India. In fact, Google Pay is the largest payments app for peer-to-peer transaction between users in India and holds the largest market share in UPI.<\/p>\n<p>Without identifying any names, Sharma, the poster child of Indian startup ecosystem, claimed that many founders in India have just accepted that it is Google that has the final say on any matter in India &#8212; and not the country\u2019s regulatory agencies.<\/p>\n<p>For Google, which reaches more users than any other company in India and whose Android operating system commands 99% of the local smartphone market, this kind of accusation is exactly what it needs to avoid in the country. The Silicon Valley search and advertising giant has launched a charm offensive in India, including a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/13\/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india\/\">recently commitment to invest $10 billion<\/a> &#8212;\u00a0more than any other American or Chinese technology firm.<\/p>\n<p>The timing for Google&#8217;s parent company, Alphabet, couldn&#8217;t be worse. Google is currently the <a href=\"https:\/\/in.reuters.com\/article\/us-india-google-antitrust-exclusive\/exclusive-google-faces-antitrust-case-in-india-over-payments-app-sources-idUKKBN2331G3\">subject of an antitrust complaint<\/a> in India over an allegation that it has abused its market position to unfairly promote its mobile payments app in the country; and in the U.S., Congress has intimidated that it may pursue antitrust regulatory action against Alphabet and Apple over app store concerns.<\/p>\n<p>In India, Google&#8217;s moves could have a devastating impact on businesses and everyday consumers.<\/p>\n<p>Paytm is not just a payments app. It is also a fully licensed digital bank. And just an eight-hour of absence from the Play Store created a panic among a portion of its users. A source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that Paytm saw several people withdraw their fixed deposit in Paytm Payments Bank on Friday.<\/p>\n<p>Anecdotally, TechCrunch heard of instances where vendors who previously preferred Paytm for accepting money digitally asked their customers to use a different payments method as they had heard that Paytm was \u201cbanned\u201d in India.<\/p>\n<p>Sharma said Google&#8217;s monopoly on Indian app ecosystem is of a magnitude unparalleled elsewhere in the world.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf paying someone and getting a cashback is gambling, then the same rule should be applied to everyone,\u201d said Sharma. \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful that we are standing here at the cusp of an internet revolution in India and we are being sanctioned by companies that are not governed by the law of this country.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If this sentiment gained traction in India it could create challenges for Google&#8217;s future in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. is forcing a Chinese company to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/19\/tiktok-deal-terms\/\">sell stakes to local firms to continue operations in the country<\/a>. In a recent episode of Dithering podcast, Ben Thompson cautioned that Trump administration\u2019s move &#8212; which some have argued is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/08\/18\/opinion\/tiktok-wechat-ban-trump.html\">a long due tit for tat against Chinese companies<\/a> (as China has long prevented U.S. firms from meaningfully operating in the world&#8217;s largest \u00a0internet market) &#8212;\u00a0might encourage\u00a0other open markets to do to American firms what it is doing to TikTok.<\/p>\n<p>Several U.S. tech executives share these concerns.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The problem with this TikTok deal is that the US is the largest player in tech globally.

One was innovative, one made clones. One was a free market while the other demanded payments to a political party and its leadership, a corrupt wealth generating scam that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/business\/global\/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html\">by some estimates<\/a> has netted top leaders billions of dollars. One kept the talent borders porous acting as a magnet for the world\u2019s top brains while the other interviewed you in a backroom at the airport before imprisoning you on sedition charges (okay, that might have been both).<\/p>\n<p>The comparison was always facile yes, but it was easy and at least directionally accurate if failing on the specifics.<\/p>\n<p>Now though, the country that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2019\/04\/lithium-ion-batteries-amazon-are-exploding\/587005\/\">exported exploding batteries<\/a> is pioneering quantum computing, while the country that pioneered the internet <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/03\/made-in-america-is-on-government-life-support-and-the-prognosis-isnt-good\/\">now builds planes that fall out of the sky<\/a> (and good news, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/boeing-flags-additional-787-production-problem-11599577936\">we\u2019ve identified even more planes<\/a> that might fall out of the sky at an airport near you!)<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tiktok\">TikTok\u2019s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> success is many things, but it is quite frankly just an embarrassment for the United States. There are thousands of entrepreneurs and hundreds of venture capitalists swarming Silicon Valley and the other American innovation hubs looking for the next great social app or building it themselves. But the power law of user growth and investor returns happens to reside in Haidian, Beijing. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/bytedance\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"bytedance\">ByteDance <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> through its local apps in China and overseas apps like TikTok <i>is<\/i> the consumer investor return of the past decade (there\u2019s a reason why all the IPOs this seasons are enterprise SaaS).<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a win that you can\u2019t chalk up just to industrial policy. Unlike in semiconductors or other capital-intensive industries where Beijing can offer billions in incentives to spur development, ByteDance builds apps. It distributes them on app stores across the world. It has exactly the same tools available to it that every entrepreneur with an Apple Developer account has access to. There is no <a href=\"https:\/\/www.csis.org\/analysis\/made-china-2025\">Made in China 2025<\/a> plan to build and popularize a consumer app like TikTok (you literally can\u2019t plan for consumer success like that). Instead, it\u2019s a well-executed product that\u2019s addictive to hundreds of millions of people.<\/p>\n<p>So much as China protected its industry from overseas competitors like Google and Amazon through market-entry barriers, America is now protecting its entrenched incumbents from overseas competitors like TikTok. We\u2019re demanding joint ventures and local cloud data sovereignty just as the Communist Party has demanded for years.<\/p>\n<p>Hell, we\u2019re apparently demanding a $5 billion tax payment from ByteDance, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-09-20\/trump-wants-5-billion-from-tiktok-deal-for-new-history-project\">which the president says will fund patriotic education for youth<\/a>. The president says a lot of things of course, but at least the $5 billion price point has been confirmed by Oracle in its press release over night (what the tax revenue will <i>actually<\/i> be used for is anyone\u2019s guess). If you followed the recent Hong Kong protests for a long time, you will remember that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-hongkong-patriotism\/hong-kong-frets-over-china-model-patriotic-education-idUSBRE86A09L20120711\">patriotic youth education<\/a> was some of the original tinder for those demonstrations back in 2012. What comes around, goes around, I guess.<\/p>\n<p>Development economists like to talk about \u201ccatch-up\u201d strategies, tactics that countries can take to avoid the middle income trap and cut the gap between the West and the rest. But what we need now are developed economists to explain America\u2019s \u201cfall behind\u201d strategy. Because we are falling behind, in pretty much everything.<\/p>\n<p>As the TikTok process and the earlier Huawei imbroglio show, America is no longer on the leading edge of technology in many key strategic markets. Mainland Chinese companies are globally winning in areas as diverse as 5G and social networks, and without direct government intervention to kill that innovation, American and European tech purveyors would have lost those markets entirely (and even <i>with<\/i> those interventions, they may still lose them). In Taiwan, TSMC has come from behind Intel to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/051b2c80-d53b-410e-8e80-f433d25a82dd\">take a year or two lead<\/a> in the fabrication of the most advanced semiconductors.<\/p>\n<p>I mean, we can\u2019t even pilfer Chinese history and mythology and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/21428088\/mulan-review-disney-live-action-remake\">turn it into a decent god damn film<\/a> these days.<\/p>\n<p>And the fall-behind strategy continues. Immigration restrictions from an administration hell-bent on destroying the single greatest source of American innovation, coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic, have fused into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/international-student-enrollment-trump-covid19-5caad69c-f6d4-4b79-bfb4-7b6ed038bc5b.html\">the largest single drop in international student migration in American history<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Why does that matter? In the U.S. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.insidehighered.com\/quicktakes\/2017\/10\/11\/foreign-students-and-graduate-stem-enrollment\">according to relatively recent data<\/a>, 81% of electrical engineering grad students are international, 79% in computer science are, and in most engineering and technical fields, the number hovers above a majority.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s great to believe the fantasy that if only these international grad students would stay home, then \u201creal\u201d Americans would somehow take these slots. But what\u2019s true of the strawberry pickers and food service workers is also true for EE grad students: proverbial \u201cAmericans\u201d don\u2019t want these jobs. They are hard jobs, thankless jobs, and require a ridiculous tenacity that American workers and students by and large don\u2019t have. These industries have huge contingents of foreign workers precisely because no one domestic wants to take these roles.<\/p>\n<p>So goes the talent, so goes the innovation. Without this wellspring of brainpower lodging itself in America\u2019s top innovation hubs, where exactly do we think it will go? That former aspiring Stanford or MIT computer scientist with ideas in his or her brain isn\u2019t just going to sit by the window gazing at the horizon waiting for the moment when they can enter the gilded halls of the U.S. of A. It\u2019s the internet era, and they are just going to get started on their dreams wherever they are, using whatever tools and resources they have available to them.<\/p>\n<p>All you have to do is look at the recent YC batches and realize that the future cohorts of great startups are going to increasingly come from outside the continental 48. Dozens of smart, brilliant entrepreneurs aren\u2019t even trying to migrate, instead rightfully seeing their home markets as more open to innovation and technological progress than the vaunted superpower. The frontier is closed here, and it has moved elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>So what are we left with here in the U.S. and increasingly Europe? A narrow-minded policy of blocking external tech innovation to ensure that our sclerotic and entrenched incumbents don\u2019t have to compete with the best in the world. If that isn\u2019t a recipe for economic disaster, I don\u2019t know what is.<\/p>\n<p>But hey: at least the youth will be patriotic.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It used to be \u201ceasy\u201d to tell the American and Chinese economies apart.

subscription monetization to more apps in 2016 \u2014 and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2016\/6\/8\/11880730\/apple-app-store-subscription-update-phil-schiller-interview\">enticed developers with an 85\/15 split<\/a> on revenue from customers that remain subscribed for more than a year \u2014 subscription monetization and retention has felt like the Holy Grail for app developers. So much so that <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/googleplay\/android-developer\/answer\/112622?hl=en\">Google quickly followed suit<\/a>\u00a0in what appeared to be an example of healthy competition for developers in the mobile OS duopoly.<\/p>\n<p>But how does that split actually work out for most apps? Turns out, the 85\/15 split \u2014 which Apple is keen to mention anytime developers complain about the App Store rev share \u2014 doesn\u2019t have a meaningful impact for most developers. Because churn.<\/p>\n<p>No matter how great an app is, subscribers are going to churn. Sometimes it\u2019s because of a credit card expiring or some other billing issue. And sometimes it\u2019s more of a pause, and the user comes back after a few months. But the majority of churn comes from subscribers who, for whatever reason, decide that the app just isn\u2019t worth paying for anymore. If a subscriber churns before the one-year mark, the developer never sees that 85% split. And even if the user resubscribes, Apple and Google reset the clock if a subscription has lapsed for more than 60 days. Rather convenient\u2026 for Apple and Google.<\/p>\n<p>Top mobile apps like Netflix and Spotify report churn rates in the low single digits, but they are the outliers. According to our data, the median churn rate for subscription apps is around\u00a013% for monthly subscriptions\u00a0and around 50% for annual. Monthly subscription churn is generally a bit higher in the first few months, then it tapers off. But an average churn of 13% leaves just 20% of subscribers crossing that magical 85\/15 threshold.<\/p>\n<p>In practice, what this means is that, for all the hype around the 85\/15 split, very few developers are going to see a meaningful increase in revenue:<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2048964\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img

subscription monetization to more apps in 2016 \u2014 and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2016\/6\/8\/11880730\/apple-app-store-subscription-update-phil-schiller-interview\">enticed developers with an 85\/15 split<\/a> on revenue from customers that remain subscribed for more than a year \u2014 subscription monetization and retention has felt like the Holy Grail for app developers. So much so that <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/googleplay\/android-developer\/answer\/112622?hl=en\">Google quickly followed suit<\/a>\u00a0in what appeared to be an example of healthy competition for developers in the mobile OS duopoly.<\/p>\n<p>But how does that split actually work out for most apps? Turns out, the 85\/15 split \u2014 which Apple is keen to mention anytime developers complain about the App Store rev share \u2014 doesn\u2019t have a meaningful impact for most developers. Because churn.<\/p>\n<p>No matter how great an app is, subscribers are going to churn. Sometimes it\u2019s because of a credit card expiring or some other billing issue. And sometimes it\u2019s more of a pause, and the user comes back after a few months. But the majority of churn comes from subscribers who, for whatever reason, decide that the app just isn\u2019t worth paying for anymore. If a subscriber churns before the one-year mark, the developer never sees that 85% split. And even if the user resubscribes, Apple and Google reset the clock if a subscription has lapsed for more than 60 days. Rather convenient\u2026 for Apple and Google.<\/p>\n<p>Top mobile apps like Netflix and Spotify report churn rates in the low single digits, but they are the outliers. According to our data, the median churn rate for subscription apps is around\u00a013% for monthly subscriptions\u00a0and around 50% for annual. Monthly subscription churn is generally a bit higher in the first few months, then it tapers off. But an average churn of 13% leaves just 20% of subscribers crossing that magical 85\/15 threshold.<\/p>\n<p>In practice, what this means is that, for all the hype around the 85\/15 split, very few developers are going to see a meaningful increase in revenue:<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2048964\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img

University of Massachusetts at Lowell, have <a href=\"https:\/\/news.mit.edu\/2020\/flat-fisheye-lens-0918\">devised a way to build a camera lens<\/a> that avoids the typical spherical curve of ultra-wide-angle glass, while still providing true optical fisheye distortion. The fisheye lens is relatively specialist, producing images that can cover as wide an area as 180 degrees or more, but they can be very costly to produce, and are typically heavy, large lenses that aren&#8217;t ideal for use on small cameras like those found on smartphones.<\/p>\n<p>This is the first time that a flat lens has been able to product clear, 180-degree images that cover a true panoramic spread. The engineers were able to make it work by patterning a thin wafer of glass on one side with microscopic, three-dimensional structures that are positioned very precisely in order to scatter any inbound light in precisely the same way that a curved piece of glass would.<\/p>\n<p>The version created by the researchers in this case is actually designed to work specifically with the infrared portion of the light spectrum, but they could also adapt the design to work with visible light, they say. Whether IR or visible light, there are a range of potential uses of this technology, since capturing a 180-degree panorama is useful not only in some types of photography, but also for practical applications like medical imaging and in computer vision applications where range is important to interpreting imaging data.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>This design is just one example of what&#8217;s called a &#8220;Metalens&#8221; &#8212; lenses that make use of microscopic features to change their optical characteristics in ways that would traditionally have been accomplished through macro design changes &#8212; like building a lens with an outward curve, for instance, or stacking multiple pieces of glass with different curvatures to achieve a desired field of view.<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s unusual here is that the ability to accomplish a clear, detailed and accurate 180-degree panoramic image with a perfectly flat metalens design came as a surprise even to the engineers who worked on the project. It&#8217;s definitely an advancement of the science that goes beyond what many assumed was the state of the art.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Engineers at MIT, in partnership with the University of Massachusetts at Lowell, have devised a way to build a camera lens that avoids the typical spherical curve of ultra-wide-angle glass, while still providing true optical fisheye distortion.

evolved into a slow and steady stream. Now, a wave of new electric vehicles is building, promising to deliver an unprecedented number of models to North America, Europe and China over the next two to three years.<\/p>\n<p>There might not be a better time to dig into EVs, and we have two superstars coming to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/tc-sessions-mobility-2020?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2020&amp;utm_content=batterytech&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=batterytechpost&amp;display=\">TC Sessions: Mobility 2020<\/a>. JB Straubel, co-founder and CEO of Redwood Materials who pioneered the battery powertrain design for Tesla as its longtime CTO, and Celina Mikolajczak, the vice president of battery technology for Panasonic Energy of North America, will join us on our virtual stage to talk about all things electric vehicles.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/tc-sessions-mobility-2020?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2020&amp;utm_content=batterytech&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=batterytechpost&amp;display=\">This virtual event takes place October 6-7<\/a>, and we\u2019re excited to hear from these two technology leaders working at the forefront of the industry.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Straubel\u2019s role at <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/tesla-motors\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tesla-motors\">Tesla <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> cannot be understated. The co-founder and executive was responsible for some of the company\u2019s most important technology during his 15 years there, including leading the cell design, supply chain and the first Gigafactory concept through the production ramp of the Model 3.<\/p>\n<p>But Straubel&#8217;s story isn&#8217;t just tied to Tesla. The former Tesla executive went on to found another startup in 2017 called <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/redwood-materials-3\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"redwood-materials-3\">Redwood Materials <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>. The battery recycling startup is focused on\u00a0circular supply chains, essentially turning waste into profit and solving the environmental impacts of new products before they happen. Its first named customer is Panasonic; and just this week announced Amazon has joined that list.<\/p>\n<p>Mikolajczak has a long history researching and developing better lithium-ion batteries. Her technical consulting practice at Exponent focused on lithium-ion cell and battery safety and quality. She then took a senior management position at Tesla that was focused on cell quality and materials engineering. During her time at Tesla, Mikolajczak developed the battery cells and packs for Tesla\u2019s Model S, Model X, Model 3 and Roadster Refresh.<\/p>\n<p>After leaving Tesla, Mikolajczak went on to serve as director of engineering focused on battery development for rideshare vehicles at Uber Technologies. Last year, she joined <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/panasonic\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"panasonic\">Panasonic <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Energy of North America, where she is vice president of battery technology. Mikolajczak leads a team of more than 200 engineers and other technical staff to improve lithium-ion cell manufacturing and to bring the latest cell technologies to mass production for Tesla at the Gigafactory facility in Sparks, Nevada.<\/p>\n<p>In short: these two know a lot about battery technology, from how it has developed in the past decade to where it&#8217;s headed and the implications it will have on automakers, consumers and the economy.<\/p>\n<p>Mikolajczak and Straubel are just two in a long list of all-star speakers, including Bryan Salesky, co-founder and CEO of Argo AI; Tekedra Mawakana, chief operating officer at Waymo; Ike co-founder and chief engineer Nancy Sun; as well as folks from Nuro, Aurora, Cruise, Lyft and Uber. There are startups as well, including Refraction AI, which came out of stealth on our stage at last year&#8217;s mobility event.<\/p>\n<p>We hope you can join in\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/tc-sessions-mobility-2020?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2020&amp;utm_content=batterytech&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=batterytechpost&amp;display=true\">October 6-7, 2020<\/a> at the event.

vehicle technology startup that was acquired by Amazon this year, has been issued a permit from California regulators that will allow it to test driverless vehicles on public roads.<\/p>\n<p>The permit is not for all public roads in the state, but it&#8217;s still notable, considering the company will be able to test its vehicles without a human safety operator behind the wheel. The California Department of Motor Vehicles, the agency that regulates automated vehicle testing in the state, has issued a permit for a designated part of Foster City in San Mateo County.<\/p>\n<p>Mark Rosekind, the former director of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration who is now chief safety officer at Zoox, called it another important milestone in the company&#8217;s &#8220;efforts to deliver safe, fully electric, and affordable autonomous mobility to riders in California.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Zoox has taken the &#8220;all of the above&#8221; approach to autonomous vehicles. The company is aiming to build a purpose-built electric vehicle, develop, test and validate the automated vehicle technology and operate a robotaxi fleet. That mission seems to be intact. Amazon has said that Zoox will remain a standalone company.<\/p>\n<p>Zoox has had a permit to test\u00a0autonomous vehicles with safety drivers since 2016. This new permit allows the company to test two autonomous vehicles without a driver behind the wheel on specified streets near its Foster City headquarters. The vehicles are approved to operate in fair weather conditions, including light rain or fog, on streets with a speed limit of no more than 45 mph, the agency said Friday.<\/p>\n<p>While dozens of companies \u2014 60 in all \u2014 have active permits to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver, it&#8217;s far less common to receive permission for driverless vehicles. Only AutoX, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/nuro-2\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"nuro-2\">Nuro <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and Waymo hold this <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/07\/nuro-gets-ok-to-test-its-driverless-delivery-vehicles-on-california-public-roads\/\">driverless permit<\/a>. Companies that receive these driverless permits have to provide evidence of insurance or a bond equal to $5 million and follow several other rules, such as training remote operators on the technology.<\/p>\n<p>Zoox also has a permit, which it received in late 2018, to\u00a0transport people in its automated vehicles on public roads. These ride-hailing permits fall under the jurisdiction of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cpuc.ca.gov\/avcissued\/\">California Public Utilities Commission<\/a> and have a variety of other requirements and rules. This permit, which allows Zoox to participate in the state\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cpuc.ca.gov\/avcpilotinfo\/\">Autonomous Vehicle Passenger Service pilot<\/a>, doesn&#8217;t allow companies to charge for rides.<\/p>\n<p>Zoox has also been testing its technology in Las Vegas, which is considered another target market. Zoox received permission from the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles in early 2019 to drive autonomously on state roads. The startup was mapping and test-driving new routes in the greater Las Vegas region last year.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Zoox, the automated vehicle technology startup that was acquired by Amazon this year, has been issued a permit from California regulators that will allow it to test driverless vehicles on public roads.

He's currently head of PR at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.anker.com\/\">Anker<\/a>.\r\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">Funding comes in stages.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Understanding these will help you know when and where to go for funding at each stage of your business. Further, it will help you communicate with funders more precisely. What you think when you hear &#8220;seed funding&#8221; and &#8220;A rounds&#8221; might be different from what investors think. You both need to be on the same page as you move forward.<\/p>\n<h2>Early money stage<\/h2>\n<p>The first stage is <em>early money<\/em>, when cash is invested in exchange for large amounts of equity. This cash, which ranges between $1,000 and $500,000, typically, comes from the three Fs: friends, family and (we don\u2019t like this nomenclature) fools. The last-named folks are essentially &#8220;giving&#8221; you cash, and these investors are well-aware that you will most likely fail \u2014 hence, &#8220;fools.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Your earliest investors should reap the biggest rewards because they are taking the most risk. The assumption is that, ultimately, you\u2019ll make good or improve their investment. The reality, they understand, is that you probably won\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>Your first money may come from bootstrapping or F&amp;F, and your first big checks may come from an <em>accelerator <\/em>that pays you about $50,000 for a fairly large stake in your company. Accelerators are essentially greenhouses \u2014 or incubators \u2014 for startups. You apply to them. If accepted, you get assistance and a small amount of funding.<\/p>\n<p>Why do investors give early money? Because they trust you, they understand your industry and they believe you can succeed. Some are curious about what you are doing and want to be close to the action. Others want to lock you up in case you are successful. In fact, many accelerators have this in mind when they connect with new startups. At its core, the funding landscape is surprisingly narrow. When you begin fundraising, you\u2019ll hear a lot of terminology including descriptions of various funding categories and investors. Let\u2019s talk about them one by one.<\/p>\n<h2>Bootstrapping<\/h2>\n<p>As the old saying goes, if you need a helping hand, you\u2019ll find it at the end of your arm. With that adage in mind, let\u2019s begin with bootstrapping.<\/p>\n<p>Bootstrapping comes from the concept of &#8220;pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps,&#8221; a comical image that computer scientists adapted to describe how a computer starts from a powered-down state. In the case of an entrepreneur, <em>bootstrapping <\/em>is synonymous with <em>sweat equity <\/em>\u2014 your own work and money that you put into your business without outside help.<\/p>\n<p>Bootstrapping is often the only way to begin a business as an entrepreneur. By bootstrapping, you will find out very quickly how invested you are, personally, in your idea.<\/p>\n<p>Bootstrapping requires you to spend money or resources on yourself. This means you either spend your own cash to build an early version of your product, or you build the product yourself, using your own skills and experience. In the case of service businesses \u2014 IT shops, design houses and so on \u2014 it requires you to quit your day job and invest, full time, in your own business.<\/p>\n<p>Bootstrapping should be a finite action. For example, you should plan to bootstrap for a year or less and plan to spend a certain amount of money bootstrapping. If you blow past your time or money budget with little to show for your efforts, you should probably scrap the idea.<\/p>\n<p>Some ideas take very little cash to bootstrap. These businesses require sweat equity \u2014 that is, your own work on a project that leads to at least a minimum viable product (MVP).<\/p>\n<p>Consider an entrepreneur who wants to build a new app-based business in which users pay (or will pay) for access to a service. Very basic Apple iOS and Google Android applications cost about $25,000 to build, and they can take up to six months to design and implement. You could also create a simpler, web-based version of the application as a bootstrapping effort, which often takes far less cash \u2014 about $5,000 at $50 an hour.<\/p>\n<p>You can also teach yourself to code and build your MVP yourself. This is often how tech businesses begin, and it says plenty about the need for founders to code or at least be proficient in the technical aspects of their business.<\/p>\n<p>You can\u2019t bootstrap forever. One entrepreneur we encountered was building a dating app. She had dedicated her life to this dating app, spending all of her money, quitting her job to continue to build it. She slept on couches and told everyone she knew about the app, networking to within an inch of her life. Years later it is a dead app in an app store containing millions of dead apps. While this behavior might get results one in a thousand times, few entrepreneurs can survive for a year of app-induced penury, let alone multiple years.<\/p>\n<p>Another entrepreneur we knew was focused on nanotubes. He spent years rushing here and there, wasting cash on flights and taking meetings with people who wanted to sell him services. Many smart investors told him that he should go and work internally at a nanotube business and then branch out when he was ready. Instead, he attacked all angles for years, eventually leading to exhaustion. He\u2019s still at it, however, which is a testament to his intensity.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What you think when you hear &#8220;seed funding&#8221; and &#8220;A rounds&#8221; might be different from what investors think.

the NSA is disrupting foreign hackers targeting COVID-19 vaccine research"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">The headlines aren&#8217;t<\/span> always kind to the National Security Agency, a spy agency that operates almost entirely in the shadows. But a year ago, the NSA launched its new Cybersecurity Directorate, which in the past year has emerged as one of the more visible divisions of the spy agency.<\/p>\n<p>At its core, the directorate focuses on defending and securing critical national security systems that the government uses for its sensitive and classified communications. But the directorate has become best known for sharing some of the more emerging, large-scale cyber threats from foreign hackers. In the past year the directorate has warned against attacks <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nsa.gov\/news-features\/press-room\/Article\/2347822\/nsa-releases-cybersecurity-technical-report-on-uefi-secure-boot-customization\/\">targeting secure boot features<\/a> in most modern computers, and doxxed a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nsa.gov\/news-features\/press-room\/Article\/2311407\/nsa-and-fbi-expose-russian-previously-undisclosed-malware-drovorub-in-cybersecu\/\">malware operation<\/a> linked to Russian intelligence. By going public, NSA aims to make it harder for foreign hackers to reuse their tools and techniques, while helping to defend critical systems at home.<\/p>\n<p>But six months after the directorate started its work, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic and large swathes of the world \u2014 and the U.S. \u2014 went into lockdown, prompting hackers to shift gears and change tactics.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The threat landscape has changed,&#8221; <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/anne-neuberger\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"anne-neuberger\">Anne Neuberger, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> NSA&#8217;s director of cybersecurity, told TechCrunch at <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/video\/spycraft-and-cybersecurity\/\">Disrupt 2020<\/a>. &#8220;We&#8217;ve moved to telework, we move to new infrastructure, and we&#8217;ve watched cyber adversaries move to take advantage of that as well,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f63cde2614bd92b18cae22d\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n<p>Publicly, the NSA <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nsa.gov\/News-Features\/News-Stories\/Article-View\/Article\/2163484\/working-from-home-select-and-use-collaboration-services-more-securely\/\">advised<\/a> on which videoconferencing and collaboration software was secure, and warned about the risks <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/national-security-agency-warns-that-vpns-could-be-susceptible-to-cyberattacks\/\">associated with virtual private networks<\/a>, of which usage boomed after lockdowns began.<\/p>\n<p>But behind the scenes, the NSA is working with federal partners to help protect the efforts to produce and distribute a vaccine for COVID-19, a feat that the U.S. government called Operation Warp Speed. News of NSA&#8217;s involvement in the operation was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cyberscoop.com\/operation-warp-speed-coronavirus-vaccine-cybersecurity-dds-nsa-dhs-cisa-fbi-hhs\/\">first reported by Cyberscoop<\/a>. As the world races to develop a working COVID-19 vaccine, which experts say is the only long-term way to end the pandemic, NSA and its U.K. and Canadian partners went public with another Russian intelligence operation aimed at targeting COVID-19 research.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re part of a partnership across the U.S. government, we each have different roles,&#8221; said Neuberger. &#8220;The role we play as part of &#8216;Team America for Cyber&#8217; is working to understand foreign actors, who are they, who are seeking to steal COVID-19 vaccine information \u2014 or more importantly, disrupt vaccine information or shake confidence in a given vaccine.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Neuberger said that protecting the pharma companies developing a vaccine is just one part of the massive supply chain operation that goes into getting a vaccine out to millions of Americans. Ensuring the cybersecurity of the government agencies tasked with approving a vaccine is also a top priority.<\/p>\n<p>Here are more takeaways from the talk, and you can watch the interview in full (embedded above).<\/p>\n<h2>Why TikTok is a national security threat<\/h2>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tiktok\">TikTok <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> is just days away from <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/18\/tiktok-and-wechat-will-be-banned-in-the-u-s-from-sunday\/\">an app store ban<\/a>, after the Trump administration earlier this year accused the Chinese-owned company of posing a threat to national security. But the government has been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/tiktok-rumors-beg-the-question-did-trump-solve-anything\/\">less than forthcoming<\/a> about what specific risks the video sharing app poses, only alleging that the app could be compelled to spy for China. Beijing has long been accused of cyberattacks against the U.S., including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/08\/24\/politics\/fbi-arrests-chinese-national-in-opm-data-breach\/index.html\">the massive breach<\/a> of classified government employee files from the Office of Personnel Management in 2014.<\/p>\n<p>Neuberger said that the &#8220;scope and scale&#8221; of TikTok&#8217;s app&#8217;s data collection makes it easier for Chinese spies to answer &#8220;all kinds of different intelligence questions&#8221; on U.S. nationals. Neuberger conceded that U.S. tech companies like Facebook and Google also collect large amounts of user data. But that there are &#8220;greater concerns on how [China] in particular could use all that information collected against populations other than its own,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ODkHMojkXH\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/18\/tiktok-and-wechat-will-be-banned-in-the-u-s-from-sunday\/\">In the WeChat, TikTok U.S. shut down order, TikTok gets Nov 12 stay, keeping it up through the US election and Oracle dealmaking<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;In the WeChat, TikTok U.S. shut down order, TikTok gets Nov 12 stay, keeping it up through the US election and Oracle dealmaking&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/18\/tiktok-and-wechat-will-be-banned-in-the-u-s-from-sunday\/embed\/#?secret=ODkHMojkXH\" data-secret=\"ODkHMojkXH\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h2>NSA is privately disclosing security bugs to companies<\/h2>\n<p>The NSA is trying to be more open about the vulnerabilities it finds and discloses, Neuberger said. She told TechCrunch that the agency has shared a &#8220;number&#8221; of vulnerabilities with private companies this year, but &#8220;those companies did not want to give attribution.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>One exception was earlier this year when <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/microsoft\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"microsoft\">Microsoft <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> confirmed NSA had found and privately reported a major cryptographic flaw in Windows 10, which could have allowed hackers to run malware masquerading as a legitimate file. The bug was so dangerous that NSA reported the vulnerability to Microsoft, which patched the bug.<\/p>\n<p>Only two years earlier, the spy agency was criticized for finding and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/05\/12\/ransomware-based-on-leaked-nsa-tools-spreads-to-dozens-of-countries\/\">using a Windows vulnerability<\/a> to conduct surveillance instead of alerting Microsoft to the flaw. The exploit was later leaked and was used to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/08\/the-wannacry-sinkhole\/\">infect thousands of computers<\/a> with the WannaCry ransomware, causing millions of dollars\u2019 worth of damage.<\/p>\n<p>As a spy agency, NSA exploits flaws and vulnerabilities in software to gather intelligence on the enemy.

To truly address privacy concerns raised by social media platforms, Congress should enact comprehensive surveillance reform and strong consumer data privacy legislation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Vanessa Pappas, who is the acting CEO of TikTok, also stepped in to endorse Mosseri&#8217;s words and publicly asked Facebook to join TikTok&#8217;s litigation against the U.S. over its moves.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">We agree that this type of ban would be bad for the industry.

Facebook and its stable of apps, as of right now, are unable to operate in China without a VPN (and even with a VPN, things can get tricky). And free speech is regularly ignored in a range of countries today.<\/p>\n<p>But the U.S. has always positioned itself as a standard-bearer in both of these areas, and so apart from the self-interest that Instagram might have in advocating for more free-market policies, it points to wider market and business position that&#8217;s being eroded.<\/p>\n<p>The issue, of course, is a little like an onion (a stinking onion, I&#8217;d say), with well more than just a couple of layers around it, and with the ramifications bigger than TikTok (with 100 million users in the U.S. and huge in pop culture beyond even that) or WeChat (much smaller in the U.S. but huge elsewhere and valued by those who do use it).<\/p>\n<p>The Trump administration has been carefully selecting issues to tackle to give voters reassurance of Trump&#8217;s commitment to &#8220;Make America Great Again,&#8221; building examples of how it&#8217;s helping to promote U.S. interests and demote those that stand in its way. China has been a huge part of that image building, positioned as an adversary in industrial, defence and other arenas. Pinpointing specific apps and how they might pose a security threat by sucking up our data fits neatly into that strategy.<\/p>\n<p>But are they really security threats, or are they just doing the same kind of nefarious data ingesting that every social app does in order to work? Will the U.S. banning them really mean that other countries, up to now more in favor of a free market, will fall in line and take a similar approach? Will people really stop being able to express themselves?<\/p>\n<p>Those are the questions that Trump has forced into the balance with his actions, and even if they were not issues before, they have very much become so now.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As people begin to process the announcement from the U.S. Department of Commerce detailing how it plans, on grounds of national security, to shut down TikTok and WeChat &#8212; starting with app downloads and updates for both, plus all of WeChat&#8217;s services, on September 20, with TikTok following with a shut down of servers and [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":13119829,"featured_media":2044902,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","carmot_uuid":"70ece084-21df-3613-9fd0-63f36171aa90"},"categories":[15986864,3457,17396],"tags":[28897,449551930,51156,42653521,3279,801,5938293,429561611],"crunchbase_tag":[449551943],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/GettyImages-1183804986-1.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/2FSanV3","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"featured":false,"subtitle":"","fundingRound":false,"seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","premiumContent":false,"premiumCutoffPercent":1,"tc_cb_mapping":[{"slug":"tiktok","cb_name":"TikTok","cb_slug":"tiktok-organization","cb_link":"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/tiktok"},{"slug":"instagram","cb_name":"Instagram","cb_slug":"instagram-organization","cb_link":"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/instagram"},{"slug":"adam-mosseri","cb_name":"Adam Mosseri","cb_slug":"adam-mosseri-person","cb_link":"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/adam-mosseri"}],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[13119829],"hideFeaturedImage":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2048754"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2048754"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2048754\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2049001,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2048754\/revisions\/2049001"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/13119829"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2048754&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/13119829"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2044902"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2048754"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2048754"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2048754"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2048754"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2048754"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2048754"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2048754"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":13119829,"name":"Ingrid Lunden","url":"","description":"","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/ingrid-lunden\/","slug":"ingrid-lunden","avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6648ec93043f0f368091adece63c6d52?s=24&d=identicon&r=g","48":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6648ec93043f0f368091adece63c6d52?s=48&d=identicon&r=g","96":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6648ec93043f0f368091adece63c6d52?s=96&d=identicon&r=g"},"links":{"facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ingridlunden","twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ingridlunden","linkedin":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/ingridlunden","crunchbase":"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/ingrid-lunden"},"position":"Writer","cbDescription":"<p>Ingrid is a writer and editor for TechCrunch, joining February 2012, based out of London.<\/p>\n\n<p>Before TechCrunch, Ingrid worked at paidContent.org, where she was a staff writer, and has in the past also written freelance regularly for other publications such as the Financial Times.

href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/unity-raises-ipo-price-range-after-jfrog-snowflake-target-steep-debut-valuations\/\">midst of IPO week<\/a> we have to add another name to our future debuts list, namely <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chime.com\/\">Chime<\/a>, which announced a huge new round of capital today. The $485 million Series F values the consumer fintech giant at $14.5 billion, a huge figure given that <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/chime-2\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"chime-2\">Chime <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> was most recently worth $5.8 billion after raising $700 million last December.<\/p>\n<p>Even more stark is the company&#8217;s $1.5 billion valuation set in early 2019. From $1.5 billion to $14.5 billion in less than two years is quite a run for any startup. Powering the latest round there were a host of familiar names, including Tiger, ICONIQ and General Atlantic, along with Dragoneer and DST Global. Names I&#8217;m less familiar with like Whale Rock Capital and Access Technology Ventures also took part.<\/p>\n<p>Tucked inside <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/09\/18\/chime-is-now-worth-14point5-billion-surging-past-robinhood-as-the-most-valuable-us-consumer-fintech-.html\">a CNBC article that broke the story<\/a> was news that Chime is now EBITDA profitable and could be &#8220;IPO-ready&#8221; in its CEO&#8217;s eyes in around a year&#8217;s time.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>TechCrunch reached out to Chime for clarification on the EBITDA point, asking if the figure is adjusted or not, as many EBTIDA metrics remove the cost of share-based compensation given to their employees. According to Chime, the metric is &#8220;true EBITDA,&#8221; to which we award an extra five points. In response to a growth question, Chime said that its &#8220;transaction and top-line&#8221; has tripled compared to the year-ago period.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"dx5dUTnMBr\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/05\/u-s-mobile-bank-chime-raises-200-million-valuing-its-business-at-1-5-billion\/\">US mobile bank Chime raises $200 million, valuing its business at $1.5 billion<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;US mobile bank Chime raises $200 million, valuing its business at $1.5 billion&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/05\/u-s-mobile-bank-chime-raises-200-million-valuing-its-business-at-1-5-billion\/embed\/#?secret=dx5dUTnMBr\" data-secret=\"dx5dUTnMBr\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The Chime round and news of its nascent, non-GAAP profitability comes on the heels of a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/11\/building-a-fintech-giant-is-very-expensive\/\">grip of reports<\/a> on the financial health of a number of European neobanks, or challenger banks as they are often called. The numbers showed huge growth, and steep losses. If Chime&#8217;s numbers hold up when we get its eventual S-1 &#8212; start your countdowns &#8212; it will be among the healthiest of the startups in its cohort in financial terms, we reckon.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, the company is trying to paint itself as something of a software company, and not a fintech company. This is a move to attract better revenue multiples when it comes time to defend its new $14.5 billion valuation. Software companies have flat-out bonkers multiples these days, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/go-public-now-while-software-valuations-make-no-sense-part-ii\/\">as evinced by the blockbuster Snowflake debut<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how Chime thinks of itself, via CNBC:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWe\u2019re more like a consumer software company than a bank,\u201d Britt said. \u201cIt\u2019s more a transaction-based, processing-based business model that is highly predictable, highly recurring and highly profitable.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The key phrases there are &#8220;software company&#8221; and &#8220;highly predictable, highly recurring and highly profitable.&#8221; In effect Chime will argue that interchange revenues should fit under the SaaS umbrella given their regularity. Investors will decide how to view that pitch. If it works, maybe fintechs are more valuable than expected. And those fintechs with obvious SaaS components, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.acorns.com\/pricing\/\">like Acorns<\/a>, could be sitting pretty when it comes to making the fintech versus SaaS argument.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless, it&#8217;s another huge round for Chime, which makes it a good day for the highly-valued fintech sector.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"nZygwYCAcw\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/06\/the-tale-of-2-challenger-bank-models\/\">The tale of 2 challenger bank models<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;The tale of 2 challenger bank models&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/06\/the-tale-of-2-challenger-bank-models\/embed\/#?secret=nZygwYCAcw\" data-secret=\"nZygwYCAcw\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the midst of IPO week we have to add another name to our future debuts list, namely Chime, which announced a huge new round of capital today.

of its expected range, selling 25 million shares at $52 per share.<\/p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s final IPO price came in far ahead of what Unity initially anticipated. The company initially expected to price its public offering between $34 and $42 per share, later raising its offering to $44 and $48 per share.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The public offering values the company at around $13.7 billion, a good step up from <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/25\/unity-now-valued-at-6b-raising-up-to-525m\/\">its final private valuation of around $6 billion<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>For Unity, the journey to the public markets has been long. The company was founded as a business that creates software for developers to make and manage their games. In that sense, the company is more like an Adobe or an Autodesk than a game studio like Activision Blizzard or King.com.<\/p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/10\/how-unity-built-a-gaming-engine-for-the-future\/\">TechCrunch explained in an earlier story profiling Unity and its public offering<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Users import digital assets (often from Autodesk\u2019s Maya) and add logic to guide each asset\u2019s behavior, character interactions, physics, lighting and countless other factors that create fully interactive games. Creators then export the final product to one or more of the 20 platforms Unity supports, such as Apple iOS and Google Android, Xbox and PlayStation, Oculus Quest and Microsoft HoloLens, etc.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The company organizes its business into two areas: tools for content creation and tools for managing and monetizing content.

Here again, the analysis <a href=\"https:\/\/monetizingmedia.com\/unity-ipo-2\/\">from TechCrunch&#8217;s previous reporting is helpful:<\/a><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>[Unity] also will want to benefit from comparisons to Epic Games, given [Epic] was just valued at $17 billion and has much greater public name recognition and hype.<\/p>\n<p>To accomplish this, Unity seems to be underplaying the significance of its advertising business (adtech companies trade at much lower revenue multiples). In the past, Unity referred to its operations in three divisions: Create, Operate and Monetize. At the start of August, the SVP and VP leading the Monetize business switched titles to SVP and VP of Operate Solutions, respectively, and then Unity reported the monetization business as a subset of its Operate division in the S-1.<\/p>\n<p>Consolidating Operate and Monetize into one reporting segment obscures specifics about how much revenue the ads business and the live services portfolio each contribute. As noted above, this segment appears to be dominated by ad revenue which means anywhere from 30% to 50% of Unity\u2019s overall revenue is from ads. That should reduce the revenue multiple public investors are willing to value Unity at relative to recent and upcoming SaaS IPOs.<\/p>\n<p>There isn\u2019t a publicly-traded game engine company to directly benchmark Unity against, nor a roster of equity research analysts at big banks who have expertise in gaming infrastructure. Adobe and Autodesk appear to be relevant businesses to benchmark Unity against with regard to the nature of the non-advertising components of the business and Unity\u2019s stated vision. Compared to Unity, those companies have lower growth rates and generate operating profits though; more recent public listings of SaaS companies like Zscaler and Cloudflare are likely to be valuation comps by investors to the extent they focus on its subscription and usage-based revenue streams since their revenue growth and margins are closer to Unity\u2019s.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Both Epic and Unity are moving to meet each other, Epic by moving downstream, and Unity by moving to higher-end applications. And both companies are looking beyond core gaming at other applications as well.<\/p>\n<p>As companies like <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/facebook\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"facebook\">Facebook, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Microsoft, Niantic and others evolve their augmented and virtual reality ecosystems, Epic and Unity may find new worlds to conquer.

started in 2015 as a platform for homeschooled students to bolster their extracurricular activities, has dramatically widened its customer base since the coronavirus pandemic began.The platform saw its total addressable market increase dramatically as students left campus to abide by COVID regulations instituted by the CDC.<\/p>\n<p>Suddenly, live, small-group online learning classes became a necessity for students. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/outschool\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"outschool\">Outschool\u2019s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> services, which range from engineering lessons through Lego challenges to Spanish teaching by Taylor Swift songs, are now high in demand.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen the CDC warned that school closures may be required, they talked about \u2018internet-based tele-schooling,\u2019\u201d co-founder <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/amirnathoo\/\">Amir Nathoo<\/a> said. \u201cWe realized they meant classes over video chat, which is exactly what we offer.\u201d<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>From August 2019 to August 2020, the online educational class service saw a more than 2,000% increase in bookings. But the surge isn\u2019t just a crop of free users piling atop the platform. Outschool\u2019s sales this year are around $54 million, compared to $6.5 million the year prior. It turned its first profit as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, and is making more than $100 million in annual run rate.<\/p>\n<p>While the profitability and growth could be a signal of the COVID-19 era, today Outschool got a vote of confidence that it isn\u2019t just a pandemic-era boom. Today, Jennifer Carolan of Reach Capital announced at TechCrunch Disrupt that Outschool has raised a $45 million Series B round, bringing its total known capital to $55 million (see the full panel on Extra Crunch below).<\/p>\n<p>The round was led by <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/lightspeed-venture-partners\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"lightspeed-venture-partners\">Lightspeed Venture Partners, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> with participation from Reach Capital, Union Square Ventures, SV Angel, FundersClub, Y Combinator and others.<\/p>\n<p>The cash gives Outschool the chance to grow its 60-person staff, which started at 25 people this year.<\/p>\n<p>Founder <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/amirnathoo\">Amir Nathoo<\/a> was programming computer games from the age of five. So when it came to starting his own company, creating a platform that helped other kids do the same felt right.<\/p>\n<p>In 2015, Nathoo grabbed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/seregine\/\">Mikhail Seregine<\/a>, who helped build Amazon Mechanical Turk and Google Consumer Surveys, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/nickgrandy\/\">Nick Grandy<\/a>, a product manager at <a href=\"https:\/\/clever.com\/\">Clever<\/a>, another edtech company and YC alum. The trio drummed up a way to help students access experiences they don\u2019t get in school.<\/p>\n<p>To gauge interest, the company tried in-person classes in the SF Bay area, online content and tested across hundreds of families. Finally, they started working with homeschoolers as an early adopter audience, all to see if people would pay for non-traditional educational experiences.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHomeschooling was interesting to us because we believed that if some new approach is going to change our education system radically for the better, it was likely that it would start outside the existing system,\u201d Nathoo said.<\/p>\n<p>He added that he observed that the homeschooling community had more flexibility around self-directed extracurricular activities. Plus, those families had a bigger stake in finding live, small-group instruction, to embed in days. The idea landed them a spot in Y Combinator in 2016, and, upon graduation, a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/06\/26\/how-to-raise-from-sesame-street\/\">$1.4 million seed round<\/a> led by Collab+Sesame.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"eF2MSjAWit\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/02\/edtech-startups-find-demand-from-an-unlikely-customer-public-schools\/\">Edtech startups find demand from an unlikely customer: Public schools<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Edtech startups find demand from an unlikely customer: Public schools&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/02\/edtech-startups-find-demand-from-an-unlikely-customer-public-schools\/embed\/#?secret=eF2MSjAWit\" data-secret=\"eF2MSjAWit\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019d all been on group video calls with work, but we hadn\u2019t seen this format of learning in K12 before,\u201d he said. Outschool began rolling out live, interactive classes in small groups. It took off quickly. Sales grew from $500,000 in 2017 to over $6 million in 2019.<\/p>\n<p>The strategy gave Outschool an opportunity to raise a Series A from Reach Capital, an edtech-focused venture capital fund, in May 2019. They began thinking outwards, past homeschooling families: what if a family with a kid in school wants extra activities, snuck in afterschool, on weekends or on holidays?<\/p>\n<p>Today feels remarkably different for the startup, and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/11\/vcs-pour-funding-into-edtech-startups-as-covid-19-shakes-up-the-market\/?tpcc=ECTW2020\">edtech more broadly<\/a>. Nathoo says that 87% of parents who purchase classes on Outschool have kids in school. The growth of Outschool\u2019s total addressable market comes with a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/01\/as-lockdowns-stretch-on-is-edtech-passing-or-failing\/\">new set of challenges and goals<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>When the pandemic started, Outschool had 1,000 teachers on its platform. Now, its marketplace hosts 10,000 teachers, all of whom have to get screened.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat has been a big challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t an open marketplace, so we had to rapidly scale our supply and quality team within our organization.\u201d While that back-end work is time-consuming and challenging, the NPS score from students has remained high, Nathoo noted.<\/p>\n<p>Outschool has a number of competitors in the live learning space. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/juni-learning\/\">Juni Learning<\/a>, for example, sells live small-group classes on coding and science. The company raised $7.5 million, led by Forerunner Ventures, and has around $10 million in ARR. Note earlier that Outschool is at $100 million in ARR.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe provide a much broader range of learning options than Juni, which is focused just on coding classes,\u201d Nathoo said. Outschool currently lists more than 50,000 classes on its website.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/varsity-tutors\/\">Varsity Tutors<\/a> is another Outschool competitor, which is more similar to Outschool. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/varsity-tutors\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"varsity-tutors\">Varsity Tutors <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> sells online tutoring and large-group classes in core subjects such as Math and English. Nathoo says that Outschool\u2019s differentiation remains in its focus of small-group teaching and a variety of topics.<\/p>\n<p>As for what\u2019s ahead for Outschool, Nathoo flirts with the idea of contradiction: what if the platform goes in schools?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I think about our strategy going forward, I think of new types of classes, international embedding and embedding ourselves back into school,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Outschool might use its growing consumer business as an engine to get into school districts, which are notoriously difficult to land deals with due to small budgets. But, to Nathoo, it\u2019s important to get into schools to increase access to learning.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur vision is to build a global education community that supplements local school,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f64f03324b00a2c5769ab66\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Outschool, which started in 2015 as a platform for homeschooled students to bolster their extracurricular activities, has dramatically widened its customer base since the coronavirus pandemic began.The platform saw its total addressable market increase dramatically as students left campus to abide by COVID regulations instituted by the CDC.

<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/directorates\/spacetech\/NASA_Technology_Enables_Precision_Landing_Without_a_Pilot\">testing<\/a> a new precision landing system designed for use on the tough terrain of the moon and Mars for the first time during an upcoming mission of Blue Origin&#8217;s New Shepard reusable suborbital rocket. The &#8220;Safe and Precise Landing \u2013 Integrated Capabilities Evolution&#8221; (SPLICE) system is made up of a number of lasers, an optical camera and a computer to take all the data collected by the sensors and process it using advanced algorithms, and it works by spotting potential hazards, and adjusting landing parameters on the fly to ensure a safe touchdown.<\/p>\n<p>SPLICE will get a real-world test of three of its four primary subsystems during a New Shepard mission to be flown relatively soon. The <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/jeff-bezos\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"jeff-bezos\">Jeff Bezos <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>-founded company typically returns its first-stage booster to Earth after making its trip to the very edge of space, but on this test of SPLICE, NASA&#8217;s automated landing technology will be operating on board the vehicle the same way they would when approaching the surface of the moon or Mars. The elements tested will include &#8220;terrain relative navigation,&#8221; Doppler radar and SPLICE&#8217;s descent and landing computer, while a fourth major system &#8212; lidar-based hazard detection &#8212; will be tested on future planned flights.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, NASA already uses automated landing for its robotic exploration craft on the surface of other planets, including the Perseverance rover headed to Mars. But a lot of work goes into selecting a landing zone with a large area of unobstructed ground that&#8217;s free of any potential hazards in order to ensure a safe touchdown. Existing systems can make some adjustments, but they&#8217;re relatively limited in that regard.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>SPLICE is designed to enable more exact landings, and ones that can deal with more nearby hazards, enabling exploration in areas that were previously considered off-limits for landers. That could greatly expand our ability to gain more knowledge and better understanding of the moon and Mars, which is particularly important as we continue to work toward more human exploration and even potential colonization.<\/p>\n<p>The lidar system mentioned above is a key new ingredient in these SPLICE tests, as we don&#8217;t actually know in great detail how well lidar will perform with the terrain on Mars and the moon, where reflectivity could be quite different from what it is here on Earth within our own atmosphere. Still, NASA is confident it should provide much better precision than radar-based methods for surface mapping and feature detection.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>NASA is going to be testing a new precision landing system designed for use on the tough terrain of the moon and Mars for the first time during an upcoming mission of Blue Origin&#8217;s New Shepard reusable suborbital rocket.

target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"checkout-com\">Checkout.com <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> has kept a low profile for many years, the company <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/22\/checkout-com-the-uk-payments-startup-raises-another-150m-now-valued-at-5-5b\/\">raised $380 million<\/a> within a year and reached an impressive valuation of $5.5 billion. It wants to build a one-stop shop for all things related to payments, such as accepting transactions, processing them and detecting fraud.<\/p>\n<p>You might think that it sounds a bit like Stripe. In an interview at <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/disrupt-sf-2020\/\">TechCrunch Disrupt<\/a>, I asked founder and CEO Guillaume Pousaz what makes Checkout.com different from Stripe, Adyen and other companies in the payment space. It comes down to a very different philosophy when it comes to product and market approach.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe only do enterprise. We really only work with the big merchants. There are a few exceptions here and there but it\u2019s mostly enterprise-only and it\u2019s purely online,\u201d Pousaz said.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\u201cI once met [Stripe CEO] <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/patrick-collison\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"patrick-collison\">Patrick Collison <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and I joked with him. I said &#8216;you might have a million merchants, I have 1,200 merchants but I know every single one by name and they all process tens of millions every year.&#8217; So I think it\u2019s just a different business,\u201d he added later in the interview.<\/p>\n<p>Checkout.com now has a ton of money sitting in its bank account, but it has been a long and slow journey to reach that level. The company has been around for many years and reached profitability in 2012. It has been spending very meticulously over the years.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f5c0f26ae62e42c37634fc4\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n<p>When talking about the early days of the company, Pousaz said the team grew really slowly. \u201cWe can hire one employee this month. Now we can hire two employees this month,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Today, the company still tries to remain as lean as possible. \u201cIt\u2019s really a matter of discipline. All these companies, they raise a lot of money, they spend a lot of money and I don\u2019t challenge that model. For us, embedding that discipline and frugality in the company in how we run it is something that was important to us,\u201d Pousaz said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no problem with spending. Just make sure that when you\u2019re spending, you\u2019re wise about it. You just don\u2019t spray and pray. You see this unfortunately too much with tech companies.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why Checkout.com mostly invests in its own product. Nearly two-thirds of the company is working in product, IT and engineering. Only 13% of the company is working in sales, which is much less than some of its competitors.<\/p>\n<p>But why did Checkout.com raise hundreds of millions of dollars then? \u201cAt some point, you need validation. And the validation was really important for us. When you have Insight, DST, Coatue, GIC, Blossom it changes your dimension,\u201d Pousaz said.<\/p>\n<p>When talking about regulators, Checkout.com has licenses in Brazil, the U.K. and France (for contingency), Hong Kong, Singapore, etc. It\u2019s a never-ending process as the company is still working on licenses in other key markets, such as Japan.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThese regulators are super thorough. You don\u2019t pass because you\u2019re a nice guy, you pass because you have the right processes,\u201d Pousaz said.<\/p>\n<p>I challenged that notion and mentioned the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wirecard_scandal\">Wirecard collapse<\/a>. He obviously thinks that Wirecard and Checkout.com are in a different position right now.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAll my money is sitting with JP Morgan, it\u2019s pretty simple. There\u2019s no bank account in the Philippines and funny stuff,\u201d Pousaz said. \u201cThe Wirecard story is so big that the real question is \u2014 go and ask the question to the auditors. Because the auditors that I have, which for the record is PwC, ask me to show them the bank statements and everything. And they are super thorough, it\u2019s a super long process.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHow did the Wirecard story happen? I don\u2019t know,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>While Checkout.com has kept a low profile for many years, the company raised $380 million within a year and reached an impressive valuation of $5.5 billion.

its 4th revision to the SEC, Palantir tries to explain what the hell is going on"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">For a company vaunted for its clandestine government work and strong engineering culture, you can\u2019t help but wonder if the government\u2019s bureaucratic norms and paperwork pushing are starting to flood into the Shire.<\/p>\n<p>When most companies go public, they file a Form S-1 with the SEC, wait a few weeks through the investor road show, then submit an amended filing with the final details of the offering before trading commences. Simple, easy, effective. No one wants to mess with the SEC, and so top securities law firms work diligently to ensure that everything is in order when that initial form is filed.<\/p>\n<p>Palantir has done nothing of the sort. It filed a confidential draft registration statement back in July. It filed an amendment. It filed another amendment. It filed its official S-1. Then an amendment, and an amendment, and an amendment, and an amendment. And it\u2019s still not trading, so another amendment is in the offing.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Palantir is not a complicated business. It\u2019s a software business (mostly) today with 125 customers, making real revenues, and with a decent story to tell investors. And yet, you can\u2019t help but look agog at the level of complication and paperwork the company has created for itself by just trying to be a little bit different from everyone else.<\/p>\n<p>One part of that complication was its invention of a direct listing with a lockup. When a company directly lists on a stock exchange, recent tradition holds that insiders are not locked up, which means that they will be allowed to start buying and selling their shares as soon as the company hits the market. For reasons that are known only to Palantir, the company decided to mostly block employee trading, limiting the float that can be expected when it begins trading.<\/p>\n<p>So <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1321655\/000119312520248369\/d904406ds1a.htm\">in today\u2019s 4th amendment to its S-1<\/a>, we have some updated figures of what the lockup will look like. Palantir will lock up about 80% of shares in the company, allowing about 380 million shares to trade on opening day. Eight million more shares will come on the market in November when certain restricted stock units vest for company employees, and other vested RSUs will also not be beholden to the lockup agreement as they come next year.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to those figures, the company noted that it is pushing back its target opening day from September 23rd to September 29th. So about a week delay, although nothing particularly notable (such changes are often made in these processes).<\/p>\n<p>The direct listing with lockup was complication number one. Complication number two is the absolute byzantine ownership structure that Palantir has selected for itself. In a note added this morning in its filing, the company admits that \u201cThis is a novel capital structure that differs significantly from those of other companies that have dual or multiple class capital structures.\u201d That\u2019s quite an understatement.<\/p>\n<p>In Palantir\u2019s governance structure, it will have three classes of shares. Class A shares have 1 vote, Class B shares have 10 votes and Class F shares (for \u201cFounder\u201d) have a variable number of votes that will ensure that Palantir\u2019s founders <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/alex-karp\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"alex-karp\">Alex Karp, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Stephen Cohen and Peter Thiel maintain 49.999999% control of the company essentially in perpetuity (or at least until they want to give it up by selling).<\/p>\n<p>Today, the company provided a handy table on exactly what that all means, as it\u2019s not simple at all. Let\u2019s take a look at a cleaned-up version of their voting table, based on which founders are employed at Palantir at a specific time:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2048737\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/palantir-infographic.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"399\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/palantir-infographic.jpg 2800w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/palantir-infographic.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/palantir-infographic.jpg?resize=300,176 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/palantir-infographic.jpg?resize=768,451 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/palantir-infographic.jpg?resize=680,399 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/palantir-infographic.jpg?resize=1536,902 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/palantir-infographic.jpg?resize=2048,1202 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/palantir-infographic.jpg?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The key here is that so long as the three founders are all actively working at Palantir, their ownership is meant to be capped at 49.999999% of the company. In other words, any other shares they own of the Class A and Class B varietals are included within that ownership number. This is something I have gotten wrong, so mea culpa, although frankly, if you need to file a half dozen amendments to the SEC to explain what you are doing, I feel like I am in good company.<\/p>\n<p>Where it gets bizarre is if one of the three founders leaves. In those scenarios, the three of them collectively will have even more power than if they all actually work at the company simultaneously. For instance, if Thiel leaves the company (which in his case means resigning from the board), the three founders actually increase their voting power collectively from 49.999999% to 64.999999%, assuming Thiel doesn\u2019t sell any of his own shares. What do those calculations ultimately mean? Well, Palantir was gracious enough to put an explanation in its fourth amendment on exactly what it all boils down to:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>While the Board retains the power to hire and remove members of our management, which currently includes two of our Founders, the Founders would continue to beneficially own shares of Class F common stock and Class B common stock and be able to exercise control over matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders so long as our Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting Agreement and certain of their affiliates collectively meet the Ownership Threshold on the applicable record date, <i>even if one or more of our Founders resigns from the Company or is terminated<\/i>. (Emphasis mine)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In other words, if you strike them down, they shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine, Shareholder.<\/p>\n<p>Palantir in this filing also made clear that there is at least some floor by which the three founders have to collectively own the company. With all three of them onboard, they have to maintain ownership over 100 million shares of the company, or slightly less than 5%. So they can\u2019t, say, own 0.0001% of the company and control 49.999999% of the vote. What a relief!<\/p>\n<p>Look, founder control is a mainstay of modern Silicon Valley tech IPOs. But we\u2019ve never seen such an extensive, interlocking set of systems designed to make a company absolutely impregnable to any form of external governance. I can understand the concerns with Palantir, given its work, its controversies and the extreme media attention it receives.
