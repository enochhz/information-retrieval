The app returned to the store eight hours later, but the controversy and acrimony Google has stirred up in the country will linger for years.<\/p>\n<p>TechCrunch reported on Friday that Google pulled <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/paytm\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"paytm\">Paytm <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> app from its app store after a repeat pattern of violations of Google Play Store guidelines by the Indian firm.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Paytm, which is locked in a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/03\/google-and-walmarts-phonepe-establish-dominance-in-indias-mobile-payments-market-as-whatsapp-pay-struggles-to-launch\/\">battle against Google to win India\u2019s payments market<\/a>, has been frustrated at Google\u2019s policies &#8212; which it argues gives Google an unfair advantage &#8212; for several past quarters over how the Android-maker is limiting its marketing campaigns to acquire new users, sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>The explanation provided by Google to Paytm for why it pulled the Indian firm\u2019s app this week from its app store is the latest attempt by the company to thwart the Noida-headquartered firm\u2019s ability to acquire new users, Paytm executives said.<\/p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.paytm.com\/the-story-behind-paytm-apps-de-listing-from-google-play-store-42b3b6f54da0\">blog post<\/a> Paytm posted Sunday evening (local India time), the Indian firm said Google took issue with the company for giving customers cashbacks and scratch cards for initiating transactions over UPI, a government-backed payments infrastructure in India that has become the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/01\/upi-india-growth-startups-business-model\/\">most popular way for people to exchange money digitally in the country.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Paytm said it rolled out this new version of scratch cards that are linked to cricket on September 11. Users collected these cricket-themed stickers for sending money to others, or making transactions such as topping up credit on their phone or paying their broadband or electricity bill.<\/p>\n<p>In a statement on Sunday evening, a Google spokesperson said, \u201coffering cashbacks and vouchers alone do not constitute a violation of our Google Play gambling policies\u201d and that Play Store \u201cpolicies are applied and enforced on all developers consistently.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But it\u2019s arguably anything but consistent.<\/p>\n<p>On September 18, Google told Paytm that it had pulled its app for not complying with Play Store\u2019s \u201cgambling policy\u201d as it offered games with \u201cloyalty points.\u201d Paytm said that Google had not expressed any concerns over Paytm\u2019s new marketing campaign prior to its notice on Friday, in which it revealed that Paytm app had been temporarily removed from the Play Store.<\/p>\n<p>But Google itself is running a similar campaign linked to cricket in India, Paytm argues. (Why cricket? Cricket is immensely popular in India and one of the biggest cricket tournaments globally, Indian Premier League, kicked off its latest season on Saturday.)<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2049284\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2049284\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2049284 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"286\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg 3284w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=150,42 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=300,84 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=768,214 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=680,190 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=1536,428 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=2048,571 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=50,14 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2049284\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cricket-themed cashback offered by Paytm (left) and Google Pay (right) in India<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Google Play Store in India has long prohibited apps that promote gambling such as betting on sporting events, and Google has raised concerns about Paytm&#8217;s marquee app promoting Paytm First Games, a fantasy sports app run by Paytm, in the past.<\/p>\n<p>Paytm executives argued that <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/phonepe\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"phonepe\">PhonePe, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> a Walmart-owned payments app in India, also promoted Dream11, the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/indian-fantasy-sports-app-dream11s-parent-firm-raises-225m-at-over-2-5b-valuation\/\">most popular fantasy sports app in the country<\/a>, and got away without any action.<\/p>\n<p>Google also permits fantasy sports app operators &#8212; including Paytm &#8212; to advertise on Search in India.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-theme=\"light\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Where is Google hypocritical?

The removal of Paytm app was only on the grounds of Paytm offering cricket-themed cashback, he claimed. \u201cGoogle is not allowing us to acquire new customers right now. That\u2019s all what this is,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s payments app, Google Pay, competes with Paytm in India. In fact, Google Pay is the largest payments app for peer-to-peer transaction between users in India and holds the largest market share in UPI.<\/p>\n<p>Without identifying any names, Sharma, the poster child of Indian startup ecosystem, claimed that many founders in India have just accepted that it is Google that has the final say on any matter in India &#8212; and not the country\u2019s regulatory agencies.<\/p>\n<p>For Google, which reaches more users than any other company in India and whose Android operating system commands 99% of the local smartphone market, this kind of accusation is exactly what it needs to avoid in the country. The Silicon Valley search and advertising giant has launched a charm offensive in India, including a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/13\/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india\/\">recently commitment to invest $10 billion<\/a> &#8212;\u00a0more than any other American or Chinese technology firm.<\/p>\n<p>The timing for Google&#8217;s parent company, Alphabet, couldn&#8217;t be worse. Google is currently the <a href=\"https:\/\/in.reuters.com\/article\/us-india-google-antitrust-exclusive\/exclusive-google-faces-antitrust-case-in-india-over-payments-app-sources-idUKKBN2331G3\">subject of an antitrust complaint<\/a> in India over an allegation that it has abused its market position to unfairly promote its mobile payments app in the country; and in the U.S., Congress has intimidated that it may pursue antitrust regulatory action against Alphabet and Apple over app store concerns.<\/p>\n<p>In India, Google&#8217;s moves could have a devastating impact on businesses and everyday consumers.<\/p>\n<p>Paytm is not just a payments app. It is also a fully licensed digital bank. And just an eight-hour of absence from the Play Store created a panic among a portion of its users. A source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that Paytm saw several people withdraw their fixed deposit in Paytm Payments Bank on Friday.<\/p>\n<p>Anecdotally, TechCrunch heard of instances where vendors who previously preferred Paytm for accepting money digitally asked their customers to use a different payments method as they had heard that Paytm was \u201cbanned\u201d in India.<\/p>\n<p>Sharma said Google&#8217;s monopoly on Indian app ecosystem is of a magnitude unparalleled elsewhere in the world.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf paying someone and getting a cashback is gambling, then the same rule should be applied to everyone,\u201d said Sharma. \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful that we are standing here at the cusp of an internet revolution in India and we are being sanctioned by companies that are not governed by the law of this country.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If this sentiment gained traction in India it could create challenges for Google&#8217;s future in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. is forcing a Chinese company to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/19\/tiktok-deal-terms\/\">sell stakes to local firms to continue operations in the country<\/a>. In a recent episode of Dithering podcast, Ben Thompson cautioned that Trump administration\u2019s move &#8212; which some have argued is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/08\/18\/opinion\/tiktok-wechat-ban-trump.html\">a long due tit for tat against Chinese companies<\/a> (as China has long prevented U.S. firms from meaningfully operating in the world&#8217;s largest \u00a0internet market) &#8212;\u00a0might encourage\u00a0other open markets to do to American firms what it is doing to TikTok.<\/p>\n<p>Several U.S. tech executives share these concerns.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The problem with this TikTok deal is that the US is the largest player in tech globally.

One was innovative, one made clones. One was a free market while the other demanded payments to a political party and its leadership, a corrupt wealth generating scam that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/business\/global\/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html\">by some estimates<\/a> has netted top leaders billions of dollars. One kept the talent borders porous acting as a magnet for the world\u2019s top brains while the other interviewed you in a backroom at the airport before imprisoning you on sedition charges (okay, that might have been both).<\/p>\n<p>The comparison was always facile yes, but it was easy and at least directionally accurate if failing on the specifics.<\/p>\n<p>Now though, the country that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2019\/04\/lithium-ion-batteries-amazon-are-exploding\/587005\/\">exported exploding batteries<\/a> is pioneering quantum computing, while the country that pioneered the internet <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/03\/made-in-america-is-on-government-life-support-and-the-prognosis-isnt-good\/\">now builds planes that fall out of the sky<\/a> (and good news, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/boeing-flags-additional-787-production-problem-11599577936\">we\u2019ve identified even more planes<\/a> that might fall out of the sky at an airport near you!)<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tiktok\">TikTok\u2019s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> success is many things, but it is quite frankly just an embarrassment for the United States. There are thousands of entrepreneurs and hundreds of venture capitalists swarming Silicon Valley and the other American innovation hubs looking for the next great social app or building it themselves. But the power law of user growth and investor returns happens to reside in Haidian, Beijing. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/bytedance\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"bytedance\">ByteDance <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> through its local apps in China and overseas apps like TikTok <i>is<\/i> the consumer investor return of the past decade (there\u2019s a reason why all the IPOs this seasons are enterprise SaaS).<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a win that you can\u2019t chalk up just to industrial policy. Unlike in semiconductors or other capital-intensive industries where Beijing can offer billions in incentives to spur development, ByteDance builds apps. It distributes them on app stores across the world. It has exactly the same tools available to it that every entrepreneur with an Apple Developer account has access to. There is no <a href=\"https:\/\/www.csis.org\/analysis\/made-china-2025\">Made in China 2025<\/a> plan to build and popularize a consumer app like TikTok (you literally can\u2019t plan for consumer success like that). Instead, it\u2019s a well-executed product that\u2019s addictive to hundreds of millions of people.<\/p>\n<p>So much as China protected its industry from overseas competitors like Google and Amazon through market-entry barriers, America is now protecting its entrenched incumbents from overseas competitors like TikTok. We\u2019re demanding joint ventures and local cloud data sovereignty just as the Communist Party has demanded for years.<\/p>\n<p>Hell, we\u2019re apparently demanding a $5 billion tax payment from ByteDance, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-09-20\/trump-wants-5-billion-from-tiktok-deal-for-new-history-project\">which the president says will fund patriotic education for youth<\/a>. The president says a lot of things of course, but at least the $5 billion price point has been confirmed by Oracle in its press release over night (what the tax revenue will <i>actually<\/i> be used for is anyone\u2019s guess). If you followed the recent Hong Kong protests for a long time, you will remember that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-hongkong-patriotism\/hong-kong-frets-over-china-model-patriotic-education-idUSBRE86A09L20120711\">patriotic youth education<\/a> was some of the original tinder for those demonstrations back in 2012. What comes around, goes around, I guess.<\/p>\n<p>Development economists like to talk about \u201ccatch-up\u201d strategies, tactics that countries can take to avoid the middle income trap and cut the gap between the West and the rest. But what we need now are developed economists to explain America\u2019s \u201cfall behind\u201d strategy. Because we are falling behind, in pretty much everything.<\/p>\n<p>As the TikTok process and the earlier Huawei imbroglio show, America is no longer on the leading edge of technology in many key strategic markets. Mainland Chinese companies are globally winning in areas as diverse as 5G and social networks, and without direct government intervention to kill that innovation, American and European tech purveyors would have lost those markets entirely (and even <i>with<\/i> those interventions, they may still lose them). In Taiwan, TSMC has come from behind Intel to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/051b2c80-d53b-410e-8e80-f433d25a82dd\">take a year or two lead<\/a> in the fabrication of the most advanced semiconductors.<\/p>\n<p>I mean, we can\u2019t even pilfer Chinese history and mythology and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/21428088\/mulan-review-disney-live-action-remake\">turn it into a decent god damn film<\/a> these days.<\/p>\n<p>And the fall-behind strategy continues. Immigration restrictions from an administration hell-bent on destroying the single greatest source of American innovation, coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic, have fused into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/international-student-enrollment-trump-covid19-5caad69c-f6d4-4b79-bfb4-7b6ed038bc5b.html\">the largest single drop in international student migration in American history<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Why does that matter? In the U.S. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.insidehighered.com\/quicktakes\/2017\/10\/11\/foreign-students-and-graduate-stem-enrollment\">according to relatively recent data<\/a>, 81% of electrical engineering grad students are international, 79% in computer science are, and in most engineering and technical fields, the number hovers above a majority.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s great to believe the fantasy that if only these international grad students would stay home, then \u201creal\u201d Americans would somehow take these slots. But what\u2019s true of the strawberry pickers and food service workers is also true for EE grad students: proverbial \u201cAmericans\u201d don\u2019t want these jobs. They are hard jobs, thankless jobs, and require a ridiculous tenacity that American workers and students by and large don\u2019t have. These industries have huge contingents of foreign workers precisely because no one domestic wants to take these roles.<\/p>\n<p>So goes the talent, so goes the innovation. Without this wellspring of brainpower lodging itself in America\u2019s top innovation hubs, where exactly do we think it will go? That former aspiring Stanford or MIT computer scientist with ideas in his or her brain isn\u2019t just going to sit by the window gazing at the horizon waiting for the moment when they can enter the gilded halls of the U.S. of A. It\u2019s the internet era, and they are just going to get started on their dreams wherever they are, using whatever tools and resources they have available to them.<\/p>\n<p>All you have to do is look at the recent YC batches and realize that the future cohorts of great startups are going to increasingly come from outside the continental 48. Dozens of smart, brilliant entrepreneurs aren\u2019t even trying to migrate, instead rightfully seeing their home markets as more open to innovation and technological progress than the vaunted superpower. The frontier is closed here, and it has moved elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>So what are we left with here in the U.S. and increasingly Europe? A narrow-minded policy of blocking external tech innovation to ensure that our sclerotic and entrenched incumbents don\u2019t have to compete with the best in the world. If that isn\u2019t a recipe for economic disaster, I don\u2019t know what is.<\/p>\n<p>But hey: at least the youth will be patriotic.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It used to be \u201ceasy\u201d to tell the American and Chinese economies apart.

developers with an 85\/15 split<\/a> on revenue from customers that remain subscribed for more than a year \u2014 subscription monetization and retention has felt like the Holy Grail for app developers. So much so that <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/googleplay\/android-developer\/answer\/112622?hl=en\">Google quickly followed suit<\/a>\u00a0in what appeared to be an example of healthy competition for developers in the mobile OS duopoly.<\/p>\n<p>But how does that split actually work out for most apps? Turns out, the 85\/15 split \u2014 which Apple is keen to mention anytime developers complain about the App Store rev share \u2014 doesn\u2019t have a meaningful impact for most developers. Because churn.<\/p>\n<p>No matter how great an app is, subscribers are going to churn. Sometimes it\u2019s because of a credit card expiring or some other billing issue. And sometimes it\u2019s more of a pause, and the user comes back after a few months. But the majority of churn comes from subscribers who, for whatever reason, decide that the app just isn\u2019t worth paying for anymore. If a subscriber churns before the one-year mark, the developer never sees that 85% split. And even if the user resubscribes, Apple and Google reset the clock if a subscription has lapsed for more than 60 days. Rather convenient\u2026 for Apple and Google.<\/p>\n<p>Top mobile apps like Netflix and Spotify report churn rates in the low single digits, but they are the outliers. According to our data, the median churn rate for subscription apps is around\u00a013% for monthly subscriptions\u00a0and around 50% for annual. Monthly subscription churn is generally a bit higher in the first few months, then it tapers off. But an average churn of 13% leaves just 20% of subscribers crossing that magical 85\/15 threshold.<\/p>\n<p>In practice, what this means is that, for all the hype around the 85\/15 split, very few developers are going to see a meaningful increase in revenue:<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2048964\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img

When we came we thought it would be temporary, but our plans have changed and now we want to try to stay in the U.S. My husband started his own company here on his J-2 visa work permit, and our daughter was born here. However, we\u2019re supposed to return to Italy for two years. How can we get a 212(e) waiver?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u2014Positive in Palo Alto<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Dear Positive:<\/p>\n<p>Congrats on your accomplishments \u2014 the birth of your daughter, your research position and your husband\u2019s startup. Happy to share about the J-1 visa, the two-year home residency requirement (a section of the law called &#8220;212(e)&#8221;) and obtaining a waiver so you can seek a green card or another type of visa. For more background, check out my podcast on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alcorn.law\/podcast\/034-j-1-two-year-foreign-residency-requirement\/\">two-year foreign residency requirement and filing a waiver<\/a> and last weeks\u2019 <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/09\/dear-sophie-what-is-a-j-1-visa-and-how-can-we-use-it\/\">Dear Sophie column with an overview of the types of J-1 visas<\/a>. The earlier you begin preparing your waiver application, the better.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alcorn.law\/j-1-educational-cultural-exchange-visa\/\">J-1 Educational and Cultural Exchange Visa<\/a> is intended for people from around the globe to work or study in the U.S. and then take their newly acquired knowledge and skills back to their home country. Given that, it is not a direct path if you decide after your arrival to remain longer term in the U.S. I recommend working with an experienced immigration lawyer to devise a strategy for reaching your goals beyond getting a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alcorn.law\/j-1-waiver-2-year-foreign-residency-requirement\/\">waiver<\/a>.

href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/ios\/ios-14\/\">iOS 14<\/a>, the next major version of the operating system for the iPhone. It is a free download and it works with the iPhone 6s or later, both generations of iPhone SE and the most recent iPod touch model. If your device runs iOS 13, it supports iOS 14. The update may or may not be immediately available, but keep checking because people are now receiving the update.<\/p>\n<p>The company is also releasing major updates for the iPad, Apple Watch and Apple TV today. So you can expect some new features with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/ipados\/ipados-14\/\">iPadOS 14<\/a>, tvOS 14 and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/watchos\/watchos-7\/\">watchOS 7<\/a> as well.<\/p>\n<p>The release of those updates <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/apple-burns-developer-goodwill-with-surprise-release-of-ios-14\/\">caught many developers by surprise<\/a>. Apple announced <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/15\/apple-ios-14-release\/\">yesterday<\/a> that iOS 14 would be ready for prime time today. Usually, the company announces the release date a week or two in advance. This way, developers have enough time to fix the last remaining bugs and submit updates to the App Store.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>If you update your iPhone today, don\u2019t be surprised if you encounter a few bugs here and there from third-party apps. There are some major changes under the hood and nobody expected such a short turnaround.<\/p>\n<p>The update is currently rolling out and is available both over-the-air in the Settings app, and by plugging your device into iTunes for a wired update. But first, back up your device. Make sure your iCloud backup is up to date by opening the Settings app on your iPhone or iPad and tapping on your account information at the top and then on your device name. Additionally, you can also plug your iOS device into your computer to do a manual backup in iTunes (or do both, really).<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t forget to encrypt your backup in iTunes. It is much safer if somebody hacks your computer. And encrypted backups include saved passwords and health data.

confidentially with the SEC to raise $500 million for its newest blank-check company.<\/p>\n<p>It will be the fourth special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, to be raised by the outfit, which is headed up by <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/chamath-palihapitiya\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"chamath-palihapitiya\">Chamath Palihapitiya <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and his longtime investment partner, Ian Osborne.<\/p>\n<p>Astonishingly, dozens more may be in the works. On the &#8220;All-In Podcast,&#8221; co-hosted by Palihapitiya, he revealed recently that has reserved the symbols from &#8220;IPOA&#8221; to &#8220;IPOZ&#8221; on the New York Stock Exchange. He also said he has $100 million of his own involved in each deal to demonstrate his alignment with potential investors.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>What&#8217;s the play? In the podcast, Palihapitiya pointed to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s economic and interest rate forecasts and its plans to keep interest rates at zero for years to come. &#8220;I mean, quite honestly,&#8221; Palihapitiya said, &#8220;there&#8217;s no path to any near-term inflation of any kind whatsoever.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s why he thinks investors are going to &#8220;get paid to be long [on] equities, because your risk-free rate is zero and will soon be negative. And what are you supposed to do if you&#8217;re an asset manager?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how he framed it: &#8220;Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re the California pension system, you have hundreds of billions of dollars, and you need to generate five or 6% a year to make sure that your pension isn&#8217;t insolvent, and the government is paying you zero.

They also used the occasion to announce that the highest-grossing actor of all time now has his own wake word. After installing the Samuel L. Jackson celebrity voice skill, Alexa users can make the &#8220;Pulp Fiction&#8221; star their default assistant voice, triggering him with the wake words \u201cHey Samuel.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I\u2019ve been using the skill on an Echo Show this week, and it\u2019s a fun addition to Alexa that swears sometimes. In fact, there\u2019s a warning when you install it that it\u2019s not particularly family-friendly (like the real Samuel L. Jackson, he uses MFer a fair bit more than your standard voice assistant). Most of the commands are just standard Alexa stuff in Jackson\u2019s voice, but there are some gems on there, like asking questions about reptiles on aircraft. He\u2019s a bit less up on some of the deeper cuts from his filmography.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">The addition of Jackson for Alexa follows Google\u2019s own introduction of celebrity voice cameos from John Legend and Issa Rae. It\u2019s clear that both companies believe a little star power goes a long way toward keeping users engaged with a virtual assistant. Honestly though, Jackson is one of the best gets you can imagine, both in terms of name recognition and novelty. It\u2019s hard to think of too many names that might top it (Obama? Oprah? Pee-Wee Herman?).<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">One of the stories Amazon is interested in telling here is how surprisingly difficult it was to create a secondary wake word. The Samuel L. Jackson skill was available before, but essentially required the user to say \u201c\u201cHey Alexa, ask Samuel\u2026\u201d Essentially a smart assistant game of telephone. The novelty wears off pretty fast, to be honest.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThe Alexa wake word has billions of interactions every week,\u201d Alexa Senior Machine Learning Manager Shiv Vitaladevuni says in a post tied to the news. \u201cHowever, there was a paucity of training data for the \u2018Hey, Samuel\u2019 wake word. To develop the multi wake word model for \u2018Hey Samuel\u2019 and Alexa, we had to develop new training and data modeling techniques, while drawing on learnings from the past.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Alexa just read me Monday\u2019s baseball scores.

is a new AI tool that acts like Google for personal conversations"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">When it comes to pop culture, a company executive or history questions, most of us use Google as a memory crutch to recall information we can&#8217;t always keep in our heads, but Google can&#8217;t help you remember the name of your client&#8217;s spouse or the great idea you came up with at a meeting the other day.<\/p>\n<p>Enter <a href=\"https:\/\/www.luther.ai\/\">Luther.AI<\/a>, which purports to be Google for your memory by capturing and transcribing audio recordings, while using AI to deliver the right information from your virtual memory bank in the moment of another online conversation or via search.<\/p>\n<p>The company is releasing an initial browser-based version of their product this week at TechCrunch Disrupt where it&#8217;s competing for the $100,000 prize at TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Luther.AI&#8217;s founders say the company is built on the premise that human memory is fallible, and that weakness limits our individual intelligence. The idea behind Luther.AI is to provide a tool to retain, recall and even augment our own brains.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a tall order, but the company&#8217;s founders believe it&#8217;s possible through the growing power of artificial intelligence and other technologies.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It\u2019s made possible through a convergence of neuroscience, NLP and blockchain to deliver seamless in-the-moment recall. <a href=\"https:\/\/openai.com\/blog\/openai-api\/\">GPT-3<\/a> is built on the memories of the public internet, while Luther is built on the memories of your private self,&#8221; company founder and CEO Suman Kanuganti told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>It starts by recording your interactions throughout the day. For starters, that will be online meetings in a browser, as we find ourselves in a time where that is the way we interact most often. Over time though, they envision a high-quality 5G recording device you wear throughout your day at work and capture your interactions.<\/p>\n<p>If that is worrisome to you from a privacy perspective, Luther is building in a few safeguards starting with high-end encryption. Further, you can only save other parties&#8217; parts of a conversation with their explicit permission. &#8220;Technologically, we make users the owner of what they are speaking. So for example, if you and I are having a conversation in the physical world unless you provide explicit permission, your memories are not shared from this particular conversation with me,&#8221; Kanuganti explained.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, each person owns their own data in Luther and nobody else can access or use these conversations either from Luther or any other individual. They will eventually enforce this ownership using blockchain technology, although Kanuganti says that will be added in a future version of the product.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2045785\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2045785\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2045785\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/3-prime-02.png?w=680\" alt=\"Luther.ai search results recalling what person said at meeting the other day about customer feedback.\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/3-prime-02.png 1400w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/3-prime-02.png?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/3-prime-02.png?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/3-prime-02.png?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/3-prime-02.png?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/3-prime-02.png?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2045785\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Luther.ai<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Kanuganti says the true power of the product won&#8217;t be realized with a few individuals using the product inside a company, but in the network effect of having dozens or hundreds of people using it, even though it will have utility even for an individual to help with memory recall, he said.<\/p>\n<p>While they are releasing the browser-based product this week, they will eventually have a stand-alone app, and can also envision other applications taking advantage of the technology in the future via an API where developers can build Luther functionality into other apps.<\/p>\n<p>The company was founded at the beginning of this year by Kanuganti and three co-founders including CTO <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/sharon-zhang\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"sharon-zhang\">Sharon Zhang, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> design director Kristie Kaiser and scientist <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/marc-ettlinger\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"marc-ettlinger\">Marc Ettlinger <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>.

As ServiceNow&#8217;s Dave Wright noted, this goes well beyond just putting together existing blocks.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The first element is actually getting familiar with the business,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;So the technology, actually building the product, isn&#8217;t that hard. That&#8217;s relatively quick. But the uniqueness when you look at all of these workflows, it&#8217;s the connection of the operations to the customer service side. Telco is a great example. You&#8217;ve got the telco network operations side, making sure that all the operational equipment is active. And then you&#8217;ve got the business service side with customer service management, looking at how the customers are getting service. Now, the interesting thing is, because we&#8217;ve got both things sitting on one platform, we can link those together really easily.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2047602\" style=\"width: 733px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screenshot-2020-09-16-105319.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2047602\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2047602\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screenshot-2020-09-16-105319.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"723\" height=\"414\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screenshot-2020-09-16-105319.jpg 723w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screenshot-2020-09-16-105319.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screenshot-2020-09-16-105319.jpg?resize=300,172 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screenshot-2020-09-16-105319.jpg?resize=680,389 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screenshot-2020-09-16-105319.jpg?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2047602\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> ServiceNow<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>On the machine learning side, ServiceNow made six acquisitions in the area in the last four years, Wright noted &#8212; and that is now starting to pay off.

When you get people together for a real-life party, you&#8217;re usually not cramming 30 people into one big group, the collective focus silently shifting to whichever face managed to get a word out.

Not so much that it&#8217;s distracting, but enough that if another table starts talking about the latest episode of a show you love, it might grab your attention. You can hop to another table with a click, then jump right back into your last conversation just as quickly.<\/p>\n<p>Tables live within &#8220;rooms,&#8221; each of which supports up to 35 users at a time. Larger events can have multiple rooms, allowing for things like live music events where each room plays a different genre.<\/p>\n<p>The whole approach is meant to give the platform an almost physical feel, without requiring much more complexity than the Zooms and Meets of the world that everyone has already grown used to. There&#8217;s no 3D aspect to it, nor virtual animated avatars to learn to control.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/6x70-RB9dFs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Need to keep others from eavesdropping? Maybe you\u2019re at a virtual pub trivia night, for example, and don&#8217;t want other teams overhearing your answers. A privacy toggle lets you lock down your tables conversation temporarily, and quickly take the walls back down when the time comes. You can also adjust the volume of the other tables if the background buzz gets too distracting.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond being able to configure things and boot troublemakers from the event, hosts get a few bonus features that guests don&#8217;t. They can &#8220;take the stage&#8221; (alone or with a guest of their choosing) to make announcements to everyone at full volume, or they can opt to randomly shuffle the tables to discourage people from hanging with the same fellow event goers the whole time.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/rally-bus\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"rally-bus\">Rally <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> co-founder Ali Jiwani tells me that their initial focus was a bit specific: They were building a platform for hosting live comedy events, so much of which depends on the energy of the crowd. When users started asking to use the platform for other things, they retuned it for broader use cases. People are still welcome to (and do!) host live comedy on the platform \u2014 it&#8217;s just not the primary focus anymore.<\/p>\n<p>Rally is built to work within the browser without any downloads, with the catch that \u201cbrowser\u201d here currently means Chrome.

This allows us to embed it in essentially opaque material,&#8221; Dworman explained. &#8220;The wall, countertop, desk, in the home, the office, retail, transportation, we see so many ways to provide information and completely invisible controls.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The surface would appear completely normal when the display is off, and indeed it is. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/video\/mui-labs-wood-touchscreen-makes-smart-homes-feel-more-natural\/\">Mui Labs, which demonstrated at CES<\/a> its own natural material display, requires a specially perforated wood surface that you probably wouldn&#8217;t want to spill coffee on. A TouchWood display is just that: wood \u2014 or many other common surface materials.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2046260\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/touchwood-gif.gif\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2046260\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2046260\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/touchwood-gif.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"495\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2046260\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A TouchWood surface in action.

A TouchWood desk would let those notifications take alternative routes, like a glowing circle off where you put your coffee or mouse. Tap it there and get a summary, or go to the content, or swipe it away \u2014 but you never have to switch tabs, or go to a different app, or unlock your phone. And when it&#8217;s done, the desk is just a piece of wood again.<\/p>\n<p>Dworman sees the transition as natural. &#8220;Touchscreens the way we know them have really only been around for 10 or 11 years. But because they&#8217;re so ubiquitous we kind of take them for granted,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When you watch sci-fi films, this tech is still being used 500 years in the future! But it shouldn&#8217;t be. In car terms, the iPhone as it is now is like the Model T.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>TouchWood aims to be a platform eventually, but needs to launch a product of its own first. It plans to have a nice sit\/stand desk with two large display areas available next year for somewhere in the $2,000 region. Expensive, yes \u2014 but you may be surprised what people will happily spend on new furniture, especially something like a major component of a newly important home office.<\/p>\n<p>After proving out the concept with a flagship product, they can start working their way into other niches and working with partners. Embedding an invisible display in a countertop, wall, or of course a restaurant table leads to all kinds of use cases. Here&#8217;s hoping TouchWood&#8217;s tech leads to a future with slightly fewer screens in it \u2014 at least ones we can see.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f6260745cfdcc2b0a2c76e9\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Everything we do seems to have an associated app these days, and all day they vie for your attention, pinging and lighting up in their needy ways.

road to augmented reality glasses&#8221; next year, a pair of smart glasses that falls short of AR capability.<\/p>\n<p>Zuckerberg also announced that Facebook will bring in luxury eyewear giant Luxottica, and the new consumer device will have Ray-Ban branding. Zuckerberg suggested that the Luxottica partnership would help accommodate an array of styles and preferences that people might have for the devices.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have a product yet to share with you today but I am excited to share that we have formed a multi-year partnership starting with building and releasing our first pair of smart glasses next year,&#8221; Zuckerberg said. The company provided little detail on what capabilities the glasses would and would not have, though confirmed to TechCrunch that it would not have a display.

Out of those 1.4 billion, nearly 1.3 billion are women,\u201d founder and CEO <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/emma-smith\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"emma-smith\">Emma Smith <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> told me.<\/p>\n<p>In many ways, bank accounts have been designed by men and for men. Even if you look at fintech startups, most of them have male founders. There is already a handful of challenger banks in Latin America, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/nubank.com.br\/en\/\">Nubank<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bancointer.com.br\">Banco Inter<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.original.com.br\">Banco Original<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uala.com.ar\">Ual\u00e1<\/a>. But most challenger banks focus on mature markets, such as Europe and the U.S. Smith thinks that targeting women in emerging countries represents a huge market opportunity.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2046343\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2046343\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2046343\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Coral-_-Sky-Cards.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Coral-_-Sky-Cards.png 4000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Coral-_-Sky-Cards.png?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Coral-_-Sky-Cards.png?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Coral-_-Sky-Cards.png?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Coral-_-Sky-Cards.png?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Coral-_-Sky-Cards.png?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Coral-_-Sky-Cards.png?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Coral-_-Sky-Cards.png?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2046343\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Jefa<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/jefa\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"jefa\">Jefa <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> has carefully examined the reasons why women in Latin America often don\u2019t have bank accounts or are unsatisfied with their bank accounts.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, banks often ask you to hold a minimum balance even though women statistically earn less than men. Banks tell you to come to a branch to open an account even though many families only have one car and taking the bus can be a hassle. Banks have overly confusing products and don\u2019t invest in marketing channels for women.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s for all those reasons that we thought we need a fully digital solution that is branchless,\u201d Smith said. &#8220;We have no minimum balance requirement; all you need is a government-issued ID and you can sign up in three or four minutes.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>When Jefa launches in a few months, opening an account will be free. You get an account and a card a few days later. The service has a built-in savings feature that lets you round up purchases and set goals.<\/p>\n<p>There will be a reward program called \u201cIt pays to be a woman.\u201d Based on your purchases, you\u2019ll earn points on hygiene products, going to the gynecologist, etc.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2046344\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2046344\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2046344\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Minimalist-Jefa-Screens.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Minimalist-Jefa-Screens.png 6000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Minimalist-Jefa-Screens.png?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Minimalist-Jefa-Screens.png?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Minimalist-Jefa-Screens.png?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Minimalist-Jefa-Screens.png?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Minimalist-Jefa-Screens.png?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Minimalist-Jefa-Screens.png?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Minimalist-Jefa-Screens.png?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2046344\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Jefa<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>At first, you\u2019ll be able to convert those points to cash back. Later, you could imagine redeeming your points at places that matter to women.<\/p>\n<p>Jefa users will be able to send and receive free peer-to-peer payments within the app. And when it comes to withdrawing and topping up your account, Jefa is building a network of merchants to securely manage cash.<\/p>\n<p>The company is also working on a credit building platform that should work a bit like Chime\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chime.com\/credit-builder\/\">equivalent feature<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Jefa will be launching first in Central America, starting with Costa Rica and Guatemala. There are already 50,000 people on the waiting list. The company knows that it\u2019ll be important to build a community around its product. So you can expect a community forum so that you can discuss finance with other Jefa users.<\/p>\n<p>Banks tend to have a bad reputation because they are soulless entities that don\u2019t necessarily understand your needs. It can be frustrating when they keep telling you that you don\u2019t meet the criteria. Creating a digital-first bank represents an opportunity for vertical banks. And Jefa is a good example of that.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f62605eccf1972ba5823488\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Meet Jefa, a startup that is building a challenger bank specifically designed for women in Latin America.

In the years since, the hardware strategy of Facebook&#8217;s virtual reality arm has weaved dramatically.<\/p>\n<p>Since CEO Mark Zuckerberg showcased the company&#8217;s three distinct product lines back in 2018 (the Oculus Go, Oculus Quest and Oculus Rift), the company has moved to contract its product offerings and go all-in on its standalone offering that does not require a PC or smartphone to operate. <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">This year, Facebook has announced the end of both the Go and Rift lines. The shrinking of device offerings comes among an expansion of features for the latest Quest 2 headset, but also comes after months of crippling product shortages for the company&#8217;s entire line of VR headsets, including its heavily hyped Quest headset, which has been unavailable or in low stock for most of 2020.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"CRXJzGVHgq\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/10\/22\/oculus-co-founder-is-leaving-facebook-after-cancellation-of-rift-2-headset\/\">Oculus co-founder is leaving Facebook after cancellation of &#8216;Rift 2&#8217; headset<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Oculus co-founder is leaving Facebook after cancellation of &#8216;Rift 2&#8217; headset&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/10\/22\/oculus-co-founder-is-leaving-facebook-after-cancellation-of-rift-2-headset\/embed\/#?secret=CRXJzGVHgq\" data-secret=\"CRXJzGVHgq\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Back in 2018, TechCrunch <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/10\/22\/oculus-co-founder-is-leaving-facebook-after-cancellation-of-rift-2-headset\/\">reported that Oculus had abruptly canceled the internal development of the Rift 2<\/a> and that Oculus co-founder Brendan Iribe was leaving the company, in part, over his frustrations with the direction of the company&#8217;s PC-based hardware and the shelving of the &#8220;complete redesign.&#8221; We later reported that Oculus was planning to release a more modestly updated headset called the Rift S, which would adopt the Quest&#8217;s inside-out tracking capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>When Facebook unveiled the Rift S months later, they shared that, unlike the Quest, which is developed wholly in-house, the PC-based headset had been designed and developed with Lenovo. At the time, Oculus co-founder Nate Mitchell, who has since left the company, classified the device as &#8220;more of an evolution of Rift than a revolution,<em>&#8221; <\/em>indicating that the device was not a full sequel.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s clear from today&#8217;s announcement that Oculus intends to fully double down on standalone VR, while allowing users with gaming PCs to continue to access existing content and titles built for platforms like SteamVR.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s unclear how important Oculus sees PC-based virtual reality to the future of the company. While the Quest 2 can be tethered to a PC via its Oculus Link software (which will soon exit beta), it seems unlikely that the company will continue to invest in PC-based content at the same pace it has in the past.

As the company kills off its Rift line of PC-only headsets, months after sunsetting its $199 Go headset, in some ways the Quest 2 feels like a last-ditch attempt at mainstream success.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2047193\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/3BA8E31B-8A90-4361-A892-855C19832712-4486-00000139FBB802A5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/3BA8E31B-8A90-4361-A892-855C19832712-4486-00000139FBB802A5.jpg 1776w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/3BA8E31B-8A90-4361-A892-855C19832712-4486-00000139FBB802A5.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/3BA8E31B-8A90-4361-A892-855C19832712-4486-00000139FBB802A5.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/3BA8E31B-8A90-4361-A892-855C19832712-4486-00000139FBB802A5.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/3BA8E31B-8A90-4361-A892-855C19832712-4486-00000139FBB802A5.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/3BA8E31B-8A90-4361-A892-855C19832712-4486-00000139FBB802A5.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/3BA8E31B-8A90-4361-A892-855C19832712-4486-00000139FBB802A5.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I thoroughly enjoyed the original Quest but its limitations were staring you right in the face. Games were limited because of the aged Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 powering the headset and the device&#8217;s OLED display felt too pixelated.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook has thankfully delivered substantial updates to both the CPU\/GPU and display, and I don&#8217;t have many complaints. The Quest 2 now uses the recently launched Qualcomm XR2 platform which delivers some steady performance gains over the 835. Oculus was a little coy about just how much better it performed, so I ended up getting on the phone with Hugo Swart, Qualcomm&#8217;s head of XR, who walked me through some details.<\/p>\n<p>He wouldn&#8217;t speak to the individual implementation of the XR2 chipset on Quest 2, but did offer up some broad comparisons between the chipset powering it compared with the first-generation Quest. The high-level is that the XR2 is wildly more powerful than the Snapdragon 835, think doubled gains when it comes to CPU and GPU performance. For developers, this could mean doubling the visual complexity of titles, something that would allow them to more easily port PC experiences to the standalone headset.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2047197\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/7AA0F0D2-F3A2-480E-9CB1-8CDB70D5CD3B-4486-00000139EA21D51B.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/7AA0F0D2-F3A2-480E-9CB1-8CDB70D5CD3B-4486-00000139EA21D51B.jpg 1776w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/7AA0F0D2-F3A2-480E-9CB1-8CDB70D5CD3B-4486-00000139EA21D51B.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/7AA0F0D2-F3A2-480E-9CB1-8CDB70D5CD3B-4486-00000139EA21D51B.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/7AA0F0D2-F3A2-480E-9CB1-8CDB70D5CD3B-4486-00000139EA21D51B.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/7AA0F0D2-F3A2-480E-9CB1-8CDB70D5CD3B-4486-00000139EA21D51B.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/7AA0F0D2-F3A2-480E-9CB1-8CDB70D5CD3B-4486-00000139EA21D51B.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/7AA0F0D2-F3A2-480E-9CB1-8CDB70D5CD3B-4486-00000139EA21D51B.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>But before you get too excited, it&#8217;s unlikely that Quest 2 titles will be harnessing this full power. Having a chipset that&#8217;s 2x as powerful actually means two things: It can do things that are twice as complex, but it can also do things that are just as complex as its predecessor while using roughly half of the power. I would imagine Facebook will push developers to focus on the latter rather than the former, especially considering that the XR2 is now powering a higher resolution display.<\/p>\n<p>Part of that is the result of launching a full successor 18 months after its predecessor and trying not to piss off early adopters who will also want to play the latest releases, but it&#8217;s also a result of Oculus choosing to optimize for form factor over software complexity. Oculus has shaved several ounces off of the device&#8217;s weight and part of this has actually come from reducing the size of the device&#8217;s battery. Oculus tells me the engineering team redesigned the battery for the Quest 2 and that it&#8217;s now 18% smaller and 29% lighter.<\/p>\n<p>The new display moves from OLED to the Fast-switch LCD type that the company used on the Rift S. It still operates at 72hz, but Oculus says that it will be pushing 90hz refresh rates to the device &#8220;soon.&#8221; The most noticeable difference to users will be the enhanced clarity of the screen which boasts a different pixel layout as well as a lot more pixels than the previous generation, over 50% more in fact. In practical use, the new display is noticeably clearer and makes painful VR experiences like reading small paragraphs of text a lot less painful.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2047405 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/8DFECBD8-35FF-4D7D-AF51-B451197DF998-4486-00000139E5EE0167.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/8DFECBD8-35FF-4D7D-AF51-B451197DF998-4486-00000139E5EE0167.jpg 1776w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/8DFECBD8-35FF-4D7D-AF51-B451197DF998-4486-00000139E5EE0167.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/8DFECBD8-35FF-4D7D-AF51-B451197DF998-4486-00000139E5EE0167.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/8DFECBD8-35FF-4D7D-AF51-B451197DF998-4486-00000139E5EE0167.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/8DFECBD8-35FF-4D7D-AF51-B451197DF998-4486-00000139E5EE0167.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/8DFECBD8-35FF-4D7D-AF51-B451197DF998-4486-00000139E5EE0167.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/8DFECBD8-35FF-4D7D-AF51-B451197DF998-4486-00000139E5EE0167.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Another interesting change with the display is how IPD (inter-pupillary distance) is shifted. A big concern with early leaks of the Quest 2 was that users wouldn&#8217;t be able to adjust the distance between the lenses to account for different face shapes. Well, the Quest does indeed allow for multiple IPD adjustments, but it&#8217;s less precise and achieved in a different way. Instead of a button or dial, users just physically pull the lenses apart, snapping them into one of three settings, 58mm, 63mm and 68mm.<\/p>\n<p>This won&#8217;t deliver a perfect experience for everyone, but is a relief for users that Oculus would follow in the footsteps of the Go and Rift S and just get rid of adjustable IPD altogether.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2047201\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/C62DB697-34CA-47AA-BB51-32CD9CD67B50-4486-00000139BC2C9C05.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/C62DB697-34CA-47AA-BB51-32CD9CD67B50-4486-00000139BC2C9C05.jpg 1776w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/C62DB697-34CA-47AA-BB51-32CD9CD67B50-4486-00000139BC2C9C05.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/C62DB697-34CA-47AA-BB51-32CD9CD67B50-4486-00000139BC2C9C05.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/C62DB697-34CA-47AA-BB51-32CD9CD67B50-4486-00000139BC2C9C05.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/C62DB697-34CA-47AA-BB51-32CD9CD67B50-4486-00000139BC2C9C05.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/C62DB697-34CA-47AA-BB51-32CD9CD67B50-4486-00000139BC2C9C05.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/C62DB697-34CA-47AA-BB51-32CD9CD67B50-4486-00000139BC2C9C05.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The new controllers are fine upgrades, taking more cues from the design of the original Rift Touch controllers and allowing for a larger thumb rest. The big upgrade is that the controllers are now more battery efficient, with Oculus telling me that the new controllers last four times longer on a single AA battery than the original Quest. No big updates beyond that for the controllers, I will say I&#8217;m not as wild about the two-tone look on the controllers as with the headset.<\/p>\n<p>That brings me to the headset housing, it has ditched the fabric-covered enclosure of the original and is now completely hard-shelled with a new two-tone light gray and black design. I like the colors, which have more of a toy-like appearance and appear a bit friendlier. It feels significantly smaller than the original Quest and the 10% reduction in weight is also apparent to heavy users of the previous generation. I was worried a shift to a plastic shell would feel cheap like the Rift S did compared to the original Rift, but the new headset housing is a highlight of the new design.<\/p>\n<p>The onboard speakers which are fit into the arms of the head-strap are, again, just okay. They work, though honestly you&#8217;ll probably want to score some good in-ear buds if you&#8217;re serious about getting immersed in the content.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2047194\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/B4E83FD7-F600-4C15-83B9-932074ECF87F-4486-00000139F71C05EB.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/B4E83FD7-F600-4C15-83B9-932074ECF87F-4486-00000139F71C05EB.jpg 1776w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/B4E83FD7-F600-4C15-83B9-932074ECF87F-4486-00000139F71C05EB.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/B4E83FD7-F600-4C15-83B9-932074ECF87F-4486-00000139F71C05EB.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/B4E83FD7-F600-4C15-83B9-932074ECF87F-4486-00000139F71C05EB.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/B4E83FD7-F600-4C15-83B9-932074ECF87F-4486-00000139F71C05EB.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/B4E83FD7-F600-4C15-83B9-932074ECF87F-4486-00000139F71C05EB.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/B4E83FD7-F600-4C15-83B9-932074ECF87F-4486-00000139F71C05EB.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not as satisfied with the decision to redesign the head strap to a fabric-only adjustable strap, which is worse that the previous generation and doesn&#8217;t redistribute weight quite as nicely. I&#8217;m sure this was done to reduce the base weight of the headset and its packable size, but I&#8217;m not convinced it was the right choice. Oculus is notably launching a pair of add-on rigid head straps which are built more like PC headsets including the $49 Elite Strap as well as a bundle that adds a small external battery into the back of the headset to extend playtime and redistribute weight more aggressively.<\/p>\n<p>On the note of battery life, the company says the Quest 2 is sticking to the 2-3 hours of battery life depending on usage. I think the sweet spot for a device like this would be a bit longer, so it&#8217;s too bad that the company opted to set this as the goal, especially given that they actually shrank the size of the battery in this release.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2047428\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2047428\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2047428 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/thumbnail-2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/thumbnail-2.jpeg 2560w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/thumbnail-2.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/thumbnail-2.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/thumbnail-2.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/thumbnail-2.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/thumbnail-2.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/thumbnail-2.jpeg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/thumbnail-2.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2047428\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Oculus Elite Strap with Battery.

All of these software perks have been evident to existing Quest owners who have seen the upgrades bringing items like hand-tracking and updates to the Oculus browser. Almost everything has been meaningfully improved from navigation to watching media content.<\/p>\n<p>All of these improvements have highlighted some limitations with the platform, though; namely there&#8217;s still not enough non-gaming content. I worry that so many of the VR-curious platforms have already grown tired of VR and decided it&#8217;s not worth the effort of maintaining a separate app. I almost wish Oculus would start integrating Android apps to the screen to passively flip through in between gaming sessions and media viewing. The Oculus browser is passable but I&#8217;d love to get quicker slightly more native access to doing some of the things I can on my phone. It seems like the platform is ready to move more in that direction.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2047188\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/D8D94C1F-F0F2-48AC-8E2C-B1AB81AEA8C4-4486-0000013A15F4F21E.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/D8D94C1F-F0F2-48AC-8E2C-B1AB81AEA8C4-4486-0000013A15F4F21E.jpg 1776w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/D8D94C1F-F0F2-48AC-8E2C-B1AB81AEA8C4-4486-0000013A15F4F21E.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/D8D94C1F-F0F2-48AC-8E2C-B1AB81AEA8C4-4486-0000013A15F4F21E.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/D8D94C1F-F0F2-48AC-8E2C-B1AB81AEA8C4-4486-0000013A15F4F21E.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/D8D94C1F-F0F2-48AC-8E2C-B1AB81AEA8C4-4486-0000013A15F4F21E.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/D8D94C1F-F0F2-48AC-8E2C-B1AB81AEA8C4-4486-0000013A15F4F21E.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/D8D94C1F-F0F2-48AC-8E2C-B1AB81AEA8C4-4486-0000013A15F4F21E.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>One clear difference in the onboarding for this device compared to past hardware is that a Facebook account is now required to activate the headset. For a small subsection of folks this might be a dealbreaker, but it&#8217;s not the most surprising development, as Facebook has been slowly opting to treat Oculus as more of an internal division rather than a distinct organization.<\/p>\n<p>The fact is, a decent amount of people do <em>hate<\/em> Facebook. After I watched the so-so documentary <em>The Social Dilemma<\/em> on Netflix this weekend, it&#8217;s also becoming clearer to me that even if popular culture trends back towards an excitement and hopefulness surrounding the tech industry over time, the scrutiny being paid toward the impact of social media companies on society will probably continue to drive distaste for Facebook. That&#8217;s a liability for Oculus, but time will tell how substantial of one it is.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2047192\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/DC79FBB8-203C-489A-8862-AE234A68CA9F-4486-0000013A001EC59B.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/DC79FBB8-203C-489A-8862-AE234A68CA9F-4486-0000013A001EC59B.jpg 1776w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/DC79FBB8-203C-489A-8862-AE234A68CA9F-4486-0000013A001EC59B.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/DC79FBB8-203C-489A-8862-AE234A68CA9F-4486-0000013A001EC59B.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/DC79FBB8-203C-489A-8862-AE234A68CA9F-4486-0000013A001EC59B.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/DC79FBB8-203C-489A-8862-AE234A68CA9F-4486-0000013A001EC59B.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/DC79FBB8-203C-489A-8862-AE234A68CA9F-4486-0000013A001EC59B.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/DC79FBB8-203C-489A-8862-AE234A68CA9F-4486-0000013A001EC59B.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Final thoughts<\/h2>\n<p>It is surprising to see such a revamp coming just a bit more than one year after the original Quest&#8217;s launch, but the new hardware is a sign of Oculus itching to double down on a new direction wholly focused on a single, more accessible device driving their vision.<\/p>\n<p>This is the most convincing argument Oculus has made for VR since its inception and pricing the device at $299, on par with a Nintendo Switch, will likely open up more folks to the vision. For existing Quest owners, this release will probably be a tad frustrating, because I think it&#8217;s worth the upgrade and its coming in so quickly even as Facebook has struggled to keep the original Quest in stock.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a fantastic VR device, but the question I&#8217;ve struggled with is whether a fantastic headset is still a great gadget. It&#8217;s still largely for gamers and will still fall danger to getting mainstream users excited for a few weeks and then spending the rest of its life in the closet.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"tnHlamhlGn\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/facebook-is-officially-killing-off-the-oculus-rift-line\/\">Facebook is officially killing off the Oculus Rift line<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Facebook is officially killing off the Oculus Rift line&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/facebook-is-officially-killing-off-the-oculus-rift-line\/embed\/#?secret=tnHlamhlGn\" data-secret=\"tnHlamhlGn\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/facebook-connect-2020\"><img src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/facebook-connect-2020.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Facebook&#8217;s virtual reality dreams have been a headache for the company.
