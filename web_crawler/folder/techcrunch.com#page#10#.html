But on this record \u2014 while the government has established that China\u2019s activities raise significant national- security concerns \u2014 it has put in scant little evidence that its effective ban of WeChat for all U.S. users addresses those concerns. And, as the plaintiffs point out, there are obvious alternatives to a complete ban, such as barring WeChat from government devices, as Australia has done, or taking other steps to address data security.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Given the likelihood of a lawsuit proceeding and the immediate damage a ban would have if implemented, the judge initiated a nationwide injunction against implementation of the Commerce Department\u2019s order to ban the app.<\/p>\n<p>Commerce will have a chance to respond to this development, and whether it chooses to edit its order, pursue other avenues through the courts, or just rescind the order entirely, we will see in the coming days.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A few days ago, the U.S. Commerce Department published a series of rules that aimed to block the downloading of TikTok and WeChat by American users, following an executive order signed by President Trump back in August.

Users collected these cricket-themed stickers for sending money to others, or making transactions such as topping up credit on their phone or paying their broadband or electricity bill.<\/p>\n<p>In a statement on Sunday evening, a Google spokesperson said, \u201coffering cashbacks and vouchers alone do not constitute a violation of our Google Play gambling policies\u201d and that Play Store \u201cpolicies are applied and enforced on all developers consistently.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But it\u2019s arguably anything but consistent.<\/p>\n<p>On September 18, Google told Paytm that it had pulled its app for not complying with Play Store\u2019s \u201cgambling policy\u201d as it offered games with \u201cloyalty points.\u201d Paytm said that Google had not expressed any concerns over Paytm\u2019s new marketing campaign prior to its notice on Friday, in which it revealed that Paytm app had been temporarily removed from the Play Store.<\/p>\n<p>But Google itself is running a similar campaign linked to cricket in India, Paytm argues. (Why cricket? Cricket is immensely popular in India and one of the biggest cricket tournaments globally, Indian Premier League, kicked off its latest season on Saturday.)<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2049284\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2049284\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2049284 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"286\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg 3284w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=150,42 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=300,84 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=768,214 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=680,190 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=1536,428 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=2048,571 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=50,14 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2049284\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cricket-themed cashback offered by Paytm (left) and Google Pay (right) in India<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Google Play Store in India has long prohibited apps that promote gambling such as betting on sporting events, and Google has raised concerns about Paytm&#8217;s marquee app promoting Paytm First Games, a fantasy sports app run by Paytm, in the past.<\/p>\n<p>Paytm executives argued that <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/phonepe\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"phonepe\">PhonePe, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> a Walmart-owned payments app in India, also promoted Dream11, the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/indian-fantasy-sports-app-dream11s-parent-firm-raises-225m-at-over-2-5b-valuation\/\">most popular fantasy sports app in the country<\/a>, and got away without any action.<\/p>\n<p>Google also permits fantasy sports app operators &#8212; including Paytm &#8212; to advertise on Search in India.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-theme=\"light\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Where is Google hypocritical?

The removal of Paytm app was only on the grounds of Paytm offering cricket-themed cashback, he claimed. \u201cGoogle is not allowing us to acquire new customers right now. That\u2019s all what this is,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s payments app, Google Pay, competes with Paytm in India. In fact, Google Pay is the largest payments app for peer-to-peer transaction between users in India and holds the largest market share in UPI.<\/p>\n<p>Without identifying any names, Sharma, the poster child of Indian startup ecosystem, claimed that many founders in India have just accepted that it is Google that has the final say on any matter in India &#8212; and not the country\u2019s regulatory agencies.<\/p>\n<p>For Google, which reaches more users than any other company in India and whose Android operating system commands 99% of the local smartphone market, this kind of accusation is exactly what it needs to avoid in the country. The Silicon Valley search and advertising giant has launched a charm offensive in India, including a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/13\/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india\/\">recently commitment to invest $10 billion<\/a> &#8212;\u00a0more than any other American or Chinese technology firm.<\/p>\n<p>The timing for Google&#8217;s parent company, Alphabet, couldn&#8217;t be worse. Google is currently the <a href=\"https:\/\/in.reuters.com\/article\/us-india-google-antitrust-exclusive\/exclusive-google-faces-antitrust-case-in-india-over-payments-app-sources-idUKKBN2331G3\">subject of an antitrust complaint<\/a> in India over an allegation that it has abused its market position to unfairly promote its mobile payments app in the country; and in the U.S., Congress has intimidated that it may pursue antitrust regulatory action against Alphabet and Apple over app store concerns.<\/p>\n<p>In India, Google&#8217;s moves could have a devastating impact on businesses and everyday consumers.<\/p>\n<p>Paytm is not just a payments app. It is also a fully licensed digital bank. And just an eight-hour of absence from the Play Store created a panic among a portion of its users. A source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that Paytm saw several people withdraw their fixed deposit in Paytm Payments Bank on Friday.<\/p>\n<p>Anecdotally, TechCrunch heard of instances where vendors who previously preferred Paytm for accepting money digitally asked their customers to use a different payments method as they had heard that Paytm was \u201cbanned\u201d in India.<\/p>\n<p>Sharma said Google&#8217;s monopoly on Indian app ecosystem is of a magnitude unparalleled elsewhere in the world.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf paying someone and getting a cashback is gambling, then the same rule should be applied to everyone,\u201d said Sharma. \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful that we are standing here at the cusp of an internet revolution in India and we are being sanctioned by companies that are not governed by the law of this country.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If this sentiment gained traction in India it could create challenges for Google&#8217;s future in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. is forcing a Chinese company to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/19\/tiktok-deal-terms\/\">sell stakes to local firms to continue operations in the country<\/a>. In a recent episode of Dithering podcast, Ben Thompson cautioned that Trump administration\u2019s move &#8212; which some have argued is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/08\/18\/opinion\/tiktok-wechat-ban-trump.html\">a long due tit for tat against Chinese companies<\/a> (as China has long prevented U.S. firms from meaningfully operating in the world&#8217;s largest \u00a0internet market) &#8212;\u00a0might encourage\u00a0other open markets to do to American firms what it is doing to TikTok.<\/p>\n<p>Several U.S. tech executives share these concerns.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The problem with this TikTok deal is that the US is the largest player in tech globally.

capitalism and the American theft of Chinese innovation"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">It used to be \u201ceasy\u201d to tell the American and Chinese economies apart. One was innovative, one made clones. One was a free market while the other demanded payments to a political party and its leadership, a corrupt wealth generating scam that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/business\/global\/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html\">by some estimates<\/a> has netted top leaders billions of dollars. One kept the talent borders porous acting as a magnet for the world\u2019s top brains while the other interviewed you in a backroom at the airport before imprisoning you on sedition charges (okay, that might have been both).<\/p>\n<p>The comparison was always facile yes, but it was easy and at least directionally accurate if failing on the specifics.<\/p>\n<p>Now though, the country that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2019\/04\/lithium-ion-batteries-amazon-are-exploding\/587005\/\">exported exploding batteries<\/a> is pioneering quantum computing, while the country that pioneered the internet <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/03\/made-in-america-is-on-government-life-support-and-the-prognosis-isnt-good\/\">now builds planes that fall out of the sky<\/a> (and good news, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/boeing-flags-additional-787-production-problem-11599577936\">we\u2019ve identified even more planes<\/a> that might fall out of the sky at an airport near you!)<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tiktok\">TikTok\u2019s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> success is many things, but it is quite frankly just an embarrassment for the United States. There are thousands of entrepreneurs and hundreds of venture capitalists swarming Silicon Valley and the other American innovation hubs looking for the next great social app or building it themselves. But the power law of user growth and investor returns happens to reside in Haidian, Beijing. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/bytedance\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"bytedance\">ByteDance <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> through its local apps in China and overseas apps like TikTok <i>is<\/i> the consumer investor return of the past decade (there\u2019s a reason why all the IPOs this seasons are enterprise SaaS).<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a win that you can\u2019t chalk up just to industrial policy. Unlike in semiconductors or other capital-intensive industries where Beijing can offer billions in incentives to spur development, ByteDance builds apps. It distributes them on app stores across the world. It has exactly the same tools available to it that every entrepreneur with an Apple Developer account has access to. There is no <a href=\"https:\/\/www.csis.org\/analysis\/made-china-2025\">Made in China 2025<\/a> plan to build and popularize a consumer app like TikTok (you literally can\u2019t plan for consumer success like that). Instead, it\u2019s a well-executed product that\u2019s addictive to hundreds of millions of people.<\/p>\n<p>So much as China protected its industry from overseas competitors like Google and Amazon through market-entry barriers, America is now protecting its entrenched incumbents from overseas competitors like TikTok. We\u2019re demanding joint ventures and local cloud data sovereignty just as the Communist Party has demanded for years.<\/p>\n<p>Hell, we\u2019re apparently demanding a $5 billion tax payment from ByteDance, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-09-20\/trump-wants-5-billion-from-tiktok-deal-for-new-history-project\">which the president says will fund patriotic education for youth<\/a>. The president says a lot of things of course, but at least the $5 billion price point has been confirmed by Oracle in its press release over night (what the tax revenue will <i>actually<\/i> be used for is anyone\u2019s guess). If you followed the recent Hong Kong protests for a long time, you will remember that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-hongkong-patriotism\/hong-kong-frets-over-china-model-patriotic-education-idUSBRE86A09L20120711\">patriotic youth education<\/a> was some of the original tinder for those demonstrations back in 2012. What comes around, goes around, I guess.<\/p>\n<p>Development economists like to talk about \u201ccatch-up\u201d strategies, tactics that countries can take to avoid the middle income trap and cut the gap between the West and the rest. But what we need now are developed economists to explain America\u2019s \u201cfall behind\u201d strategy. Because we are falling behind, in pretty much everything.<\/p>\n<p>As the TikTok process and the earlier Huawei imbroglio show, America is no longer on the leading edge of technology in many key strategic markets. Mainland Chinese companies are globally winning in areas as diverse as 5G and social networks, and without direct government intervention to kill that innovation, American and European tech purveyors would have lost those markets entirely (and even <i>with<\/i> those interventions, they may still lose them). In Taiwan, TSMC has come from behind Intel to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/051b2c80-d53b-410e-8e80-f433d25a82dd\">take a year or two lead<\/a> in the fabrication of the most advanced semiconductors.<\/p>\n<p>I mean, we can\u2019t even pilfer Chinese history and mythology and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/21428088\/mulan-review-disney-live-action-remake\">turn it into a decent god damn film<\/a> these days.<\/p>\n<p>And the fall-behind strategy continues. Immigration restrictions from an administration hell-bent on destroying the single greatest source of American innovation, coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic, have fused into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/international-student-enrollment-trump-covid19-5caad69c-f6d4-4b79-bfb4-7b6ed038bc5b.html\">the largest single drop in international student migration in American history<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Why does that matter? In the U.S. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.insidehighered.com\/quicktakes\/2017\/10\/11\/foreign-students-and-graduate-stem-enrollment\">according to relatively recent data<\/a>, 81% of electrical engineering grad students are international, 79% in computer science are, and in most engineering and technical fields, the number hovers above a majority.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s great to believe the fantasy that if only these international grad students would stay home, then \u201creal\u201d Americans would somehow take these slots. But what\u2019s true of the strawberry pickers and food service workers is also true for EE grad students: proverbial \u201cAmericans\u201d don\u2019t want these jobs. They are hard jobs, thankless jobs, and require a ridiculous tenacity that American workers and students by and large don\u2019t have. These industries have huge contingents of foreign workers precisely because no one domestic wants to take these roles.<\/p>\n<p>So goes the talent, so goes the innovation. Without this wellspring of brainpower lodging itself in America\u2019s top innovation hubs, where exactly do we think it will go? That former aspiring Stanford or MIT computer scientist with ideas in his or her brain isn\u2019t just going to sit by the window gazing at the horizon waiting for the moment when they can enter the gilded halls of the U.S. of A. It\u2019s the internet era, and they are just going to get started on their dreams wherever they are, using whatever tools and resources they have available to them.<\/p>\n<p>All you have to do is look at the recent YC batches and realize that the future cohorts of great startups are going to increasingly come from outside the continental 48. Dozens of smart, brilliant entrepreneurs aren\u2019t even trying to migrate, instead rightfully seeing their home markets as more open to innovation and technological progress than the vaunted superpower. The frontier is closed here, and it has moved elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>So what are we left with here in the U.S. and increasingly Europe? A narrow-minded policy of blocking external tech innovation to ensure that our sclerotic and entrenched incumbents don\u2019t have to compete with the best in the world. If that isn\u2019t a recipe for economic disaster, I don\u2019t know what is.<\/p>\n<p>But hey: at least the youth will be patriotic.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It used to be \u201ceasy\u201d to tell the American and Chinese economies apart.

So much so that <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/googleplay\/android-developer\/answer\/112622?hl=en\">Google quickly followed suit<\/a>\u00a0in what appeared to be an example of healthy competition for developers in the mobile OS duopoly.<\/p>\n<p>But how does that split actually work out for most apps? Turns out, the 85\/15 split \u2014 which Apple is keen to mention anytime developers complain about the App Store rev share \u2014 doesn\u2019t have a meaningful impact for most developers. Because churn.<\/p>\n<p>No matter how great an app is, subscribers are going to churn. Sometimes it\u2019s because of a credit card expiring or some other billing issue. And sometimes it\u2019s more of a pause, and the user comes back after a few months. But the majority of churn comes from subscribers who, for whatever reason, decide that the app just isn\u2019t worth paying for anymore. If a subscriber churns before the one-year mark, the developer never sees that 85% split. And even if the user resubscribes, Apple and Google reset the clock if a subscription has lapsed for more than 60 days. Rather convenient\u2026 for Apple and Google.<\/p>\n<p>Top mobile apps like Netflix and Spotify report churn rates in the low single digits, but they are the outliers. According to our data, the median churn rate for subscription apps is around\u00a013% for monthly subscriptions\u00a0and around 50% for annual. Monthly subscription churn is generally a bit higher in the first few months, then it tapers off. But an average churn of 13% leaves just 20% of subscribers crossing that magical 85\/15 threshold.<\/p>\n<p>In practice, what this means is that, for all the hype around the 85\/15 split, very few developers are going to see a meaningful increase in revenue:<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2048964\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img

been<\/span> poised to benefit from a potential TikTok ban in the U.S. Though that may not happen now, given the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/national-security-panel-to-meet-on-oracle-tiktok-deal-tuesday-11600187547\">apparent<\/a> Oracle deal, the chaos around TikTok has increased the attention given to alternative apps such as Triller. As <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tiktok\">TikTok <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> users sought a new home &#8212; or at least hedged their bets in the event of a full ban &#8212; <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/triller\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"triller\">Triller&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> app shot up the app store charts. It even became the No. 1 across 80 different countries at some point, Triller CEO Mike Lu says.<\/p>\n<p>At Techcrunch Disrupt 2020, Lu today spoke of Triller&#8217;s growing potential and what makes its app unique. He also touched on Triller&#8217;s involvement in several high-profile additions, including influencers and public figures like TikTok star <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/9\/15\/21438111\/charli-damelio-tiktok-triller-app-rival-dixie-marc-heidi\">Charli D&#8217;Amelio and family<\/a>, and even Trump himself.<\/p>\n<p>Lu also noted another top TikToker, Addison Rae, will make her way to Triller this week, as well.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Though Triller has often positioned itself as a different sort of app than TikTok, the company has steadily worked to onboard the same set of influencers that made TikTok so popular. TikTok star Josh Richards recently <a href=\"https:\/\/people.com\/tech\/tiktok-josh-richards-noah-beck-join-triller\/\">joined<\/a> Triller as both an investor and chief strategy officer, despite being only 18, for example. Other TikTok stars Noah Beck and Griffin Johnson also <a href=\"https:\/\/people.com\/tech\/tiktok-josh-richards-noah-beck-join-triller\/\">joined<\/a> Triller earlier this summer.<\/p>\n<p>And just this week, Triller snagged TikTok&#8217;s queen herself, Charli D&#8217;Amelio, whose current TikTok account has 87 million followers.<\/p>\n<p>Though Triller often benefits from influencers setting up their own accounts, Lu confirmed Triller reached out to D&#8217;Amelio to establish the relationship and to learn how the company could help her create a different type of presence on the Triller app.<\/p>\n<p>Deal terms were not disclosed, but Lu said that, &#8220;up until a month ago, we had never paid anyone to make a video.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">follow my triller teehee<\/p>\n<p>&mdash; charli d\u2019amelio (@charlidamelio) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/charlidamelio\/status\/1305668575240228864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 15, 2020<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>TikTok stars aren&#8217;t the only notable new additions. Last month, Donald Trump <a href=\"https:\/\/mashable.com\/article\/donald-trump-tiktok-ban-triller-app\/\">launched<\/a> his own official Triller account, as well, to promote his political campaign.<\/p>\n<p>Lu said he welcomes all the new users, including Trump.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re an open platform and what we really strive for is creativity. So, we welcome anyone &#8212; regardless of whether you&#8217;re on the left side or the right side of the fence &#8212; to express yourself on the Triller platform,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Seeing some of the world leaders and also some of the biggest influencers in the world join the platform is very exciting for Triller.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Lu also explained how Triller differentiates itself from the broader social media app lineup, noting that much of the focus of older social networks had been on allowing users to post status updates, not creative content.<\/p>\n<p>Triller&#8217;s identity, Lu added, &#8220;has always been around music, around content, and around creative discovery.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I think that we will always shine more than your traditional status updates &#8212; which I think that the world of Facebook, Instagram and Twitter has done really well,&#8221; he said. But today&#8217;s users &#8220;really don&#8217;t post creative content to those old platforms anymore,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;They&#8217;re actually posting them on platforms like ourselves, where they&#8217;re looking for an expressive and creative outlet.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Lu claimed Triller also benefited from older social networks&#8217; attempt to enter the short-form video space.<\/p>\n<p>When Instagram launched its TikTok competitor, Reels, Triller saw a 20% spike in usage, Lu said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We realized that a lot of users who were waiting for Reels&#8230;they saw what it was. And they decided they&#8217;re sticking to Triller,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>On the topic of business matters, Lu declined to speak about recent reports of its<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/04\/triller-tiktok\/\"> supposed billion-dollar valuation<\/a>, but did confirm Triller is in the process of raising new funding. He also declined to speak about the status of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-usa-tiktok-centricus\/triller-says-made-20-billion-bid-with-centricus-for-tiktok-assets-idUSKBN25O30N?il=0\">Triller&#8217;s reported $20 billion bid<\/a> with Centricus for TikTok assets, but said the company believed it would have been a good home for TikTok creator content from an infrastructure perspective.<\/p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, given Triller&#8217;s potential growth in the midst of TikTok concerns, Lu also supported the idea that TikTok could be a security threat to U.S. users.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Given the sensitivity of the data [and] the amount of data that they collect, it does pose a national risk,&#8221; Lu said of TikTok. &#8220;This is a Chinese-owned company. The data is sitting, probably, not here in the States&#8230;&#8221; he added, seemingly refuting TikTok&#8217;s claims that its U.S. data was on U.S. servers.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We take that stuff very seriously.

building marketplace companies.\t<\/div>\n\t\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">Over the last<\/span> several months, we\u2019ve seen dramatic swings in the demand for healthcare across the country. While hospitals in some cities were overwhelmed by an influx of COVID-19 patients, others sat empty \u2014 and in many cases experienced financial distress \u2014 as patients postponed elective surgeries and care for non-life-threatening matters. Cities went from relative safe zones to dangerous hotspots and back again within a matter of a few months.<\/p>\n<p>This &#8220;COVID-19 whipsaw&#8221; has brought into focus a problem that has long been simmering in healthcare: The movement of labor is highly inefficient. We need a new paradigm in healthcare labor markets.<\/p>\n<h2>The pandemic has exposed systemic vulnerabilities<\/h2>\n<p>Early in the pandemic, many clinicians moved across state lines to answer Governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s calls for help in New York,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-health-coronavirus-newyork-staffing\/new-york-city-hospitals-cancel-temporary-workers-as-coronavirus-cases-stabilize-idUSKCN21X00X\"> only to be told upon arrival that their contracts had been canceled<\/a> because the hospitals had overestimated their need. The imbalance of nurse and physician labor across states, which existed well before the pandemic, reached a terrifying apex during the height of the pandemic. In some parts of the country, clinicians were being furloughed or laid off, while in others they were stretched to their full capacity working around the clock to save lives. With each month came new hotspots \u2014 New York, Detroit, Miami, Phoenix, Los Angeles \u2014 and with each new hotspot a near disaster caused by a shortage of healthcare workers.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The marathon of addressing COVID-19 has imposed severe stress, depression and anxiety on our nation as a whole, with our healthcare providers at the epicenter. Clinician burnout <a href=\"https:\/\/www.americanmobile.com\/nursezone\/nursing-news\/new-survey-finds-high-rate-of-nurse-fatigue\/\">was a serious issue<\/a> even before COVID-19, but it has only gotten worse in recent months, especially for those working in geographic hotspots.<\/p>\n<p>Healthcare workers across the country have found themselves delivering care for a high volume of acutely ill patients, often with severely limited supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE), magnifying their own risk. Many have watched colleagues fall sick and even die, while others have been asked to ration patient care. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thelancet.com\/journals\/eclinm\/article\/PIIS2589-5370(20)30168-1\/fulltext\">Multiple<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/assets-global.website-files.com\/5c5b66e10b42f155662a8e9e\/5eac7f8885c94fd16ca2f898_mental-health-survey-2020.pdf\">studies<\/a> have highlighted increased instances of depression, anxiety, insomnia and psychological distress amongst frontline workers, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2020\/04\/28\/us\/er-doctor-coronavirus-help-death-by-suicide-trnd\/index.html\">some clinicians have even taken their own lives<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Challenges with the legacy staffing model<\/h2>\n<p>Prior to the pandemic, our healthcare system had long dealt with seasonal and geographic differences in healthcare demand. Flu season, for example, causes more demand for healthcare in December than July. Florida experiences more demand for care in February than June because snowbirds migrate from the northeast in the winter and bring their healthcare needs with them.<\/p>\n<p>In the past, temporary or contingent workers \u2014 travel nurses, per diem nurses and locum tenens doctors \u2014 helped to balance supply of labor with the seasonal and geographic peaks and troughs in demand. Staffing agencies worked with these temporary clinicians to match them with opportunities at hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, long-term care facilities and other providers. Many people don\u2019t realize that temporary clinicians are an important part of the healthcare workforce. Estimates are that supplemental staffing accounts for <a href=\"https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/0046958013516583\">more than 30% <\/a>of total nursing hours in the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>Staffing agencies, however, cannot scale for pandemic scale events because they are using outdated tools and processes. Recruiters at staffing agencies make phone calls and send emails to communicate with the clinicians who are frequently annoyed by inconvenient and unwanted solicitations. More importantly, these tools are not fast enough when we experience sudden unpredicted spikes in different geographic areas like those in the past six months.<\/p>\n<p>Outdated regulations are partly to blame. Licensure for nurses is handled state-by-state, which creates obstacles that prohibit nurses from working in states where they are not licensed. There are approximately 35 states that are part of a licensing compact that offers mutual recognition, but many of the largest states and those hit hardest by the early days of the pandemic &#8212; like California, New York and Washington &#8212; are not part of the compact. In California, it takes six weeks on average to get a license for an out-of-state nurse, a number that has not budged even as the state\u2019s COVID-19 cases have skyrocketed.<\/p>\n<p>Some states that are not part of the compact have used executive actions or emergency declarations to allow nurses to cross state lines, but many of those are now expiring and were never meant to be a long-term solution. The pandemic has highlighted the need for new regulations as part of the solution described below that allow for a more fluid movement of clinicians across state lines. Are patients and diseases in California really that different from the patients and diseases in Texas such that we need different regulatory standards and license requirements in each state?<\/p>\n<h2>The solution: A vertical marketplace for healthcare workers<\/h2>\n<p>We need to move beyond the antiquated staffing agency model to facilitate a more rapid response, a better clinician experience and more efficient matching. The good news is that we are starting to see companies addressing this problem with a software-centric model: the vertical labor marketplace. Some examples of these marketplaces include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.trustedhealth.com\/\">Trusted Health<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/nomadhealth.com\/\">Nomad Health<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Like StubHub, the company I started 20 years ago, these marketplaces use the power of the internet to connect supply with demand. In the case of these healthcare labor marketplaces, the clinicians make up the supply while the hospitals and other care facilities make up the demand. Rather than scouring the job boards for individual hospitals or fielding calls from recruiters, clinicians can see all available positions that meet their skills and experience, along with compensation and other job details. They can check the marketplace when it is convenient without getting inundated by phone calls or emails.<\/p>\n<p>Clinicians can use the marketplaces to come in and out of the labor pool as they wish. This helps to reduce stress and increase work-life balance before burnout sets in. Some nurses might choose to leverage the marketplace to move to Florida in the winter to serve the snowbirds while others may choose to take the summer off and work during flu season. The marketplace also creates financial opportunities for underutilized clinicians by better allocating their labor to geographies and hospitals that need them. Hospitals and other providers benefit from these simple-to-use cloud-based marketplaces that allow them to quickly ramp up capacity when they need it most.<\/p>\n<h2>The system needs more contingent workers<\/h2>\n<p>In the staffing agency paradigm, when an independent hospital experiences a spike in demand it must work with a staffing agency to bring in temporary clinicians quickly. A multihospital health system has the advantage of being able to move clinicians from lower demand hospitals to a sister-hospital that is experiencing an unexpected peak. A widely adopted national marketplace would theoretically have an even greater advantage because its broader visibility across more hospitals would allow it to move resources from hospitals with excess capacity to those with the highest demand, even if the two hospitals are unaffiliated.<\/p>\n<p>There have been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ucsf.edu\/news\/2020\/04\/417151\/ucsf-health-care-workers-serve-new-york-city\">heroic doctors and nurses<\/a> who have volunteered to move to areas with the highest demand. However, hospitals and health systems are not incentivized to lend out their doctors and nurses to nonaffiliated hospitals. Therefore, the solution requires more clinicians to be in the contingent workforce (like travel and per diem nurses). If the mix between contingent nurses and permanent nurses were 70\/30 instead of 30\/70, peaks and troughs would be more easily handled since a larger percentage of the resources would be shared across a larger network of hospitals. The marketplaces would have an even greater impact on our society because they would be able to allocate even more resources to the hospitals with the most acute needs.<\/p>\n<p>There are two possible sources of additional contingent workers. First, permanent healthcare workers may decide to terminate their affiliation with a single hospital or health system in favor of contingent work because they are attracted to the flexibility. Second, workers in other industries may choose to enter the healthcare industry because it provides more options for contingent work. Regardless of the path, an expansion of the supply of contingent healthcare workers is a necessary part of the solution.<\/p>\n<h2>A side benefit: Stronger financial health for our hospitals<\/h2>\n<p>During the pandemic, patients across the country chose to postpone many elective surgeries and non-life-threatening procedures because they were scared of contracting the virus at the hospital. As a result, hospitals lost revenue from profitable elective procedures. Because hospitals have huge fixed costs (salaries are a big component), the government has provided tens of billions of stimulus money for hospitals in financial distress.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to all the other benefits described above, a more widely adopted vertical labor marketplace for healthcare workers would provide relief to hospitals by shifting a larger portion of clinician labor from a fixed cost to a variable cost. Hospitals would have a smaller number of permanent employees and a larger number of temporary contingent workers. When demand drops, hospitals would use fewer contingent clinicians. When demand rises, they could tap into the marketplace to bring on more capacity.<\/p>\n<p>A marketplace approach to America\u2019s healthcare and its clinicians is long overdue. While the pandemic magnified our current system\u2019s vulnerabilities, they have been there all along. By leveraging the technology and marketplace paradigm that has made so many other industries efficient, we can improve not only our healthcare system and clinician quality of life, but also our hospitals\u2019 bottom line. Let\u2019s galvanize the collective distress COVID-19 has created and use it to pioneer a more efficient model for all.<\/p>\n<p><em>* Craft is an investor in Trusted.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Let\u2019s galvanize the collective distress COVID-19 has created and use it to pioneer a more efficient model for all.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":133574325,"featured_media":2046154,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","carmot_uuid":"0be87a83-b3fd-3ad6-91c6-02cd574c727b"},"categories":[25515,337,352,13217,17396],"tags":[576740177,73767,20052,576751660,449559475,576746470,576748315],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/GettyImages-1211152561.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/2Rvhh5q","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"featured":true,"subtitle":"COVID-19 has exposed long-standing systemic vulnerabilities","fundingRound":false,"seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","premiumContent":false,"premiumCutoffPercent":1,"tc_cb_mapping":[{"slug":"national-health-service","cb_name":"National Health Service","cb_slug":"nhs-choices-organization","cb_link":"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/nhs-choices"}],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[2046070],"hideFeaturedImage":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2046113"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2046113"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2046113\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2046609,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2046113\/revisions\/2046609"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/jeff-fluhr"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2046113&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/133574325"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2046154"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2046113"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2046113"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2046113"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2046113"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2046113"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2046113"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2046113"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":2046070,"name":"Jeff Fluhr","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/jeff-fluhr\/","description":"Jeff Fluhr is a general partner at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.craftventures.com\/\">Craft Ventures<\/a>, the founder and former CEO of StubHub and is an expert on building marketplace companies.","slug":"jeff-fluhr","links":{"twitter":"jefffluhr"},"position":"Contributor","cbDescription":"Jeff Fluhr is a general partner at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.craftventures.com\/\">Craft Ventures<\/a>, the founder and former CEO of StubHub and is an expert on building marketplace companies.","cbAvatar":"","twitter":"jefffluhr"}],"author":[{"id":133574325,"name":"Walter Thompson","url":"https:\/\/anchor.fm\/thegoldencity","description":"Senior Editor Walter Thompson manages Extra Crunch and TechCrunch's guest post program.

today at TechCrunch Disrupt Startup Battlefield, wants to make it easier for businesses to collaborate remotely. Its system, which combines a large interactive digital whiteboard and cloud service, allows users to host remote brainstorming sessions, client presentations, virtual trainings and more. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/vibe-3fdf\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"vibe-3fdf\">Vibe <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> also works with a large ecosystem of popular workplace apps, like Slack, Dropbox, Teams, Zoom, OneDrive, Chrome, Asana, <a href=\"https:\/\/vibe.us\/android-app-store\/\">and many others<\/a>, allowing businesses to continue to use the tools they&#8217;re already invested in, instead of having to learn an entirely new workflow or switch apps.<\/p>\n<p>The Bellevue, Washington-headquartered startup was founded in 2016 by a team looking for the ideal remote collaboration solution. Initially, they believed this would mean VR devices with headsets, but later came to realize that what they really wanted was a single tool that would serve as a platform for real-time collaboration.<\/p>\n<p>Today, the Vibe system includes a 55-inch, 4K touchscreen device that integrates with third-party apps in full-screen or split-screen modes, allowing customers to videoconference, chat or use the apps while whiteboarding.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Users can also annotate on top of presentations, pictures and files from other apps, then save them into whiteboard projects. Vibe&#8217;s high-resolution rendering engine offers an unlimited canvas, low latency, and a cross-app annotation experience, the company says.<\/p>\n<p>The Vibe board can also function as a second screen via screencasting or an HDMI cable while supporting annotation. The company&#8217;s cloud service for Vibe, meanwhile, is based on AWS.<\/p>\n<p>Vibe promises low latency drawing response time of fewer than 7 milliseconds for sketching and writing, as well as a collaboration experience that lets participants collaborate across devices, including via their web browser, iPad or Android tablet, in addition to the Vibe board itself.<\/p>\n<p>The product stealth-launched in late 2019 and has sold to over 400 customers so far. Vibe is officially launching to the public at TechCrunch Disrupt&#8217;s Startup Battlefield.<\/p>\n<p>The company says many of its existing customers opted for Vibe so they can continue to use apps like Zoom and Slack, which aren&#8217;t integrated with Microsoft&#8217;s Surface Board, Google&#8217;s Jamboard, Samsung&#8217;s Flip, or Cisco&#8217;s WebEx brand boards.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f61281ed7e193329967727f\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n<p>This is an important feature for customers who need to work with clients over the apps their clients use, the company notes. It also helps Vibe sell to school system I.T. departments, as its open ecosystem means it&#8217;s easier for teachers, students, and admins to adopt its technology.<\/p>\n<p>The board itself is $2,999 and doesn&#8217;t have any ongoing monthly or annual service fees. That significantly undercuts the competition. Google Jamboard today is $4,999, plus a $600 annual subscription; Cisco WebEx Board is $4,990, plus a $199 monthly subscription); and Microsoft\u2019s Surface Hub is $8,999, plus an Office 365 Subscription.<\/p>\n<p>The company tells TechCrunch it got to the lower price point by using an IR touch sensor instead of a P-CAP touch sensor to reduce 20% of the cost. The trade-off here is Vibe has worse palm rejection, but they believe it will satisfy most collaboration scenarios. In addition, the company customizes its OS and rendering engine to work on an all-in-one ARM chip instead of Intel-based Windows. The trade in this case is that users won&#8217;t need to buy an extra mini PC for Vibe to work with, but the performance could be worse in some scenarios.<\/p>\n<p>The Vibe co-founding team has backgrounds in engineering, image processing, computer vision and supply chain logistics.<\/p>\n<p>Vibe CEO <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/charles-yang-a285\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"charles-yang-a285\">Charles Yang <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> is a serial entrepreneur who studied Computer Science at Zhejiang University, where he met his co-founders.

As a penetration tester, or <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/02\/red-team-ethical-limits\/\">&#8220;red teamer,&#8221;<\/a> she would test the limits of a company&#8217;s cybersecurity defenses by using a number of techniques, including social engineering attacks, which often involves tricking someone into turning over a password or access to a system.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It was just very easy to get into organizations by social engineering employees,&#8221; said Ricks. But the existing offerings on the market, she said, weren&#8217;t up to the task of educating users at scale.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And so we built the product in-house,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/hacware-inc\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"hacware-inc\">HacWare <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> sits on a company&#8217;s email server and uses machine learning to categorize and analyze each message for risk \u2014 the same things you would look for in a phishing email, like suspicious links and attachments.<\/p>\n<p>HacWare tries to identify the most at-risk users, like those working in finance and human resources, who are more vulnerable to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/12\/hackers-coronavirus-malware\/\">business email compromise attacks<\/a> that try to steal sensitive employee information. The system also uses automated simulated phishing attacks using the contents of what&#8217;s in a user&#8217;s inbox already to send personalized phishing emails to test the user.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f6123ddd7e19332996763ef\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n<p>Email remains the most popular way for attackers to use phishing and other social engineering attacks to try to steal sensitive information, according to Verizon&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/enterprise.verizon.com\/resources\/reports\/dbir\/\">annual data breach report<\/a>. These attackers want your passwords or to try to trick you into sending sensitive documents, like employee tax and financial information.<\/p>\n<p>But as the adage goes, humans are the weakest link in the security chain.<\/p>\n<p>Stronger security features, like two-factor authentication, makes it far more difficult for hackers to break into accounts but it&#8217;s not a panacea. It was only in July that Twitter was hit by a devastating breach that saw hackers use social engineering techniques to trick employees into giving over access to an <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/15\/twitter-hacker-admin-scam\/\">internal &#8220;admin&#8221; tool<\/a> that the hackers abused to hijack high-profile accounts and spread <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/15\/twitter-accounts-hacked-crypto-scam\/\">a cryptocurrency scam<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>HacWare&#8217;s approach to email security appears to be working. &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen a 60% reduction in reducing phishing responses,&#8221; she said. The automated phishing simulations also help to reduce IT workload, she said.<\/p>\n<p>Ricks moved the bootstrapped HacWare to New York City after securing a place in Techstars&#8217; accelerator program. HacWare is seeking to raise a $1 million seed round, said Ricks. For now, the company is &#8220;laser focused&#8221; on email security, but the company has growth in its sights.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I see us expanding into just trying to understand human behavior and trying to figure out how we can mitigate that risk,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We believe that cyber security is an integrated approach,&#8221; said Ricks. &#8220;But first we definitely need to start with the root cause, and the root cause is we need to really get our people the tools they need to empower them to make sound cybersecurity decisions,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/wO5vueBgDLc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Let&#8217;s face it, email security is something a lot of people would rather think less about.

data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"amazon\">Amazon <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> &#8212; today announced a new financing round.<\/p>\n<p>Bangalore-based <a

Munich Re Ventures, the investment arm of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/07\/next-insurance-raises-250m-from-munich-re-becomes-a-unicorn\/\">one of the world&#8217;s largest reinsurers<\/a>, led the financing round, while existing investors Amazon, RPS Ventures and Intact Ventures, corporate venture arm of Canada\u2019s largest property and casualty insurer, participated in it.<\/p>\n<p>The new round, which brings Acko\u2019s to-date raise to $200 million, valued the three-year-old startup at about $500 million (<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/13\/acko-a-digital-insurance-provider-in-india-raises-another-65m-at-a-300m-valuation\/\">up from about $300 million last year<\/a>), a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Acko develops and sells bite-sized auto insurance products (aimed at drivers and others in transportation-related scenarios). The startup expanded its catalog six months ago to provide healthcare protections that it sells to businesses and employers. More than\u00a0150,000 employees are already covered by Acko&#8217;s healthcare protection, the startup said.<\/p>\n<p>Acko founder and chief executive Varun Dua told TechCrunch in an interview that the startup has amassed over 60 million customers and has issued over 650 million policies to date.<\/p>\n<p>Offering a large catalog of bite-sized insurance policies is crucial for firms in India. Only a fraction of the nation\u2019s 1.3 billion people currently have access to insurance and most can\u2019t afford sizeable policies.<\/p>\n<p>According to rating agency ICRA, insurance products had reached less than 3% of the population as of 2017. An average Indian makes about $2,100 a year, according to the World Bank. ICRA estimated that of those Indians who had purchased an insurance product, they were spending less than $50 on it in 2017.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re excited to join forces with one of the leading digital insurers in India, as well as other investment partners, to help support Varun and his impressive team as they continue their journey,\u201d said Oshri Kaplan, director at Munich Re Ventures, in a statement.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs Munich Re Ventures\u2019 first investment in India, we look forward to the positive impact that digitally native insurance solutions will have on the country with Acko leading the way.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Acko sells insurance policies directly to customers or through partners such as Amazon, which entered the insurance space in the country earlier this year in\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/23\/amazon-now-sells-auto-insurance-in-india\/\">collaboration with Acko<\/a>. (Amazon currently accounts for only a fraction of the insurance Acko sells, people familiar with the matter said.)<\/p>\n<p>Acko\u2019s products have quickly gained popularity in India for three reasons. It does not rely on middlemen, who have proven to slow down innovation for the insurance industry at large, Dua explained. Having direct engagement with a customer allows Acko to offer more competitive and personalized policies, he said.<\/p>\n<p>The second is Acko\u2019s underwriting technology, for which it comb through a range of data points to assess whether someone is eligible for a policy, he said.<\/p>\n<p>Acko has also made it easier for people to access policies and then claim them. As everything is digital, sign-up does not require any paperwork and making a claim is quick, too &#8212; factors that keep existing customers happy, Dua said.<\/p>\n<p>Scores of startups and established banks in India have launched products to win this market. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/paytm\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"paytm\">Paytm <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> (India\u2019s most valuable startup) and its co-founder and chief executive, Vijay Shekhar Sharma, announced in July they were <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/06\/paytm-vijay-shekhar-sharma-to-acquire-raheja-qbe-for-76m\/\">acquiring insurance firm Raheja QBE for a sum of $76 million<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Dua, who has spent more than a decade in the insurance business, said he was not worried about the competition as the market is large enough.<\/p>\n<p>The startup plans to use the fresh capital to scale its technology and data teams by at least 30% to 40%, Dua said. It also plans to use a portion of the capital to invest in branding to reach more customers, especially those living in smaller cities and towns in India.<\/p>\n<p>The rest of the money will be used to finance the insurance policies. Unlike several fintech startups in India that work with banking partners to finance loans, current regulatory rules require insurance firms to underwrite risks themselves.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We would love to be in a position where we always have a strong balance sheet,&#8221; Dua said. (Avendus Capital was the financial advisor to Acko for the deal.)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A young Indian startup that is taking on the country\u2019s antiquated insurance industry with a digital-first product &#8212; and which has already received backing from global giant Amazon &#8212; today announced a new financing round.

The stock is currently up a staggering 191% in 2020.<\/p>\n<p>Fitbit&#8217;s share price was relatively unchanged in intra-day trading. The company launched a Fitbit Premium service last month, but its stock is flat from the beginning of the year.<\/p>\n<p>Things didn&#8217;t look much different for the more entrenched fitness companies. Weight Watchers International, which has seen its share price nearly halved since the beginning of the year, was down less than 1% by time of publication, and Planet Fitness, which has had a rough year but is showing signs of recovery, was up nearly 5% at the time of writing.<\/p>\n<p>Why so little movement across the board? Well, Apple is pressing forward on entering a number of digital markets in its services business at the moment, and that spread can mean less focus on dominating an industry. With its <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/15\/apple-one-bundles-icloud-music-tv-arcade-news-and-fitness-for-30-a-month\/\">Apple One subscription bundling fitness on the higher-end tier<\/a>, there&#8217;s always the danger that consumers won&#8217;t leave another subscription to join Apple, but already belonging to the Apple One will prevent them from looking at rival fitness services.<\/p>\n<p>Underestimating Apple is never a wise proposition, but the company is in an unprecedented position as it looks to kickstart several digital services and, out-of-the-gate at least, they haven&#8217;t all been slam dunks.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/Apple-Hardware-Event-2020\/\"><img src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/apple-hardware-event-2020.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Usually, Apple making a grand entrance to an entrenched market would spell doom for the players there, but when it comes to Apple&#8217;s latest digital workout service, it doesn&#8217;t look like investors are worried about Fitness+ killing the momentum.

We did the learning in the cloud, but the recognition was done in the edge device and we had to convert quickly and get it down. Our bill in the first few months made us move that way. You couldn&#8217;t be streaming data over LTE or 3G for too long.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>At SRI, Chai worked on a project that looked at how to best manage power for flying objects where, if you have a single source of power, the system could intelligently allocate resources for either powering the flight or running the onboard compute workloads, mostly for surveillance, and then switch between them as needed. Most of the time, in a surveillance use case, nothing happens. And while that&#8217;s the case, you don&#8217;t need to compute every frame you see.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We took that and we made it into a tool and a platform so that you can apply it to all sorts of use cases, from voice to vision to segmentation to time series stuff,&#8221; Kandasamy explained.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"lVWZRoDuI7\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/13\/what-ai-startups-need-to-achieve-before-vcs-will-invest\/\">What AI startups need to achieve before VCs will invest<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;What AI startups need to achieve before VCs will invest&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/13\/what-ai-startups-need-to-achieve-before-vcs-will-invest\/embed\/#?secret=lVWZRoDuI7\" data-secret=\"lVWZRoDuI7\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>What&#8217;s important to note here is that the company offers the various components of what it calls the Latent AI Efficient Inference Platform (LEIP) as standalone modules or as a fully integrated system. The compressor and compiler are the first two of these and what the company is launching today is LEIP Adapt, the part of the system that manages the dynamic AI workloads Kandasamy described above.<\/p>\n<p>In practical terms, the use case for LEIP Adapt is that your battery-powered smart doorbell, for example, can run in a low-powered mode for a long time, waiting for something to happen. Then, when somebody arrives at your door, the camera wakes up to run a larger model &#8212; maybe even on the doorbell&#8217;s base station that is plugged into power &#8212; to do image recognition.

class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> unveiled a new chip that will power the next generation of its hardware (including that phone whenever it&#8217;s launched). The A14 Bionic, which will ship first with the new iPad Air, is going to be Apple&#8217;s fastest yet.<\/p>\n<p>In the space race that is CPU and GPU improvements, this is a groundbreaking step change. Apple says that the A14 makes it the first to use five nanometer process technology, incredibly small-scale but powerful architecture, with 11.8 billion transistors packed into the chip, up 40% on its previous generation seven nanometer chips. This will work out to 11 trillion operations per second.<\/p>\n<p>This makes the iPad Air, as one example, something that it will market not just at younger users because of its competitive price, but gamers and other power users. Photo editing will be faster, and so will any analytical applications, with the chip also featuring a 16-core neural engine, essential for machine learning but also any app that relies on AI processes.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>All this translates into a more efficient chip: more power with less battery consumption, with more processes run in parallel across a six-core design. Apple also says this will make the chip up to two times faster than the most popular Windows laptop, three times faster than the fastest Android tablet and six times faster than the fastest Chromebook. (No, it doesn&#8217;t say which devices these are, specifically.)<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2046783\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-1.54.30-PM-2.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"378\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-1.54.30-PM-2.png 1080w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-1.54.30-PM-2.png?resize=150,83 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-1.54.30-PM-2.png?resize=300,167 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-1.54.30-PM-2.png?resize=768,427 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-1.54.30-PM-2.png?resize=680,378 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-1.54.30-PM-2.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There is a reason why Apple spells out how fast the chip makes its new tablet compared to some other popular devices in the world of consumer electronics (without mentioning any brand names, of course).<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s because chips are quite literally at the heart of how the consumer electronics industry competes, and the next generation of how that will play out will be very interesting indeed, with Nvidia this weekend announcing its intent to acquire Arm &#8212; an Apple partner &#8212; for<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/13\/nvidia-confirms-40b-purchase-of-arm-bringing-together-two-chip-giants\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> $40 billion<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Arm has positioned itself as a &#8220;Switzerland&#8221; in the industry, providing its designs to everyone on equal footing, but it has been increasingly taking on a more autonomous role in its chip design over the years, and this A14 is the latest product of that strategy.<\/p>\n<p>More to come.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/Apple-Hardware-Event-2020\/\"><img src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/apple-hardware-event-2020.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>No iPhone 12 announced today, but Apple unveiled a new chip that will power the next generation of its hardware (including that phone whenever it&#8217;s launched).

for a skosh under $80 a year will give users access to workouts and instruction, plus folds in music, delivered through the Apple Watch or iPad.<\/p>\n<p>Fitness+ will cost $9.99 a month or $79.99 a year. Apple is offering the first three months free with the purchase of a watch. Up to five family members will also be able to use Fitness+ for no additional charge, the company said Tuesday. The service will launch in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the U.K. and the United States before the end of the year.<\/p>\n<p>The launch of Fitness+ builds on the growing number of health metrics already available on the Apple Watch, including heart rate, calories burned, pace and distance. This new service folds in a catalog of video workouts that can be viewed on a user&#8217;s iPhone, iPad or Apple TV. Once a user launches a video, it communicates with and starts the correct workout in their Apple Watch workout app.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2046818\" style=\"width: 2690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-11.15.36-AM.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2046818\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2046818 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-11.15.36-AM.jpg\" alt=\"Apple hardware event-fitness\" width=\"2680\" height=\"1436\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-11.15.36-AM.jpg 2680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-11.15.36-AM.jpg?resize=150,80 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-11.15.36-AM.jpg?resize=300,161 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-11.15.36-AM.jpg?resize=768,412 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-11.15.36-AM.jpg?resize=680,364 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-11.15.36-AM.jpg?resize=1536,823 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-11.15.36-AM.jpg?resize=2048,1097 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-11.15.36-AM.jpg?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2680px) 100vw, 2680px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2046818\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Apple\/screenshot<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The user&#8217;s health metrics are sent in real time to whatever screen they&#8217;re using to watch the workout video.

(virtual) hardware event today, the company announced a significantly redesigned iPad Air with a new look and tiny bezels. In a move portentous for other Apple products, Touch ID has returned \u2014 inside the power button on the top of the tablet.<\/p>\n<p>For the 10th anniversary of the iPad, the new fourth-generation Air is the biggest change to the device in a while. &#8220;This is a big year for iPad,&#8221; said CEO Tim Cook, before introducing changes to the non-Pro tablets in the lineup. &#8220;And today, we&#8217;re thrilled to introduce an all new completely redesigned iPad Air.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The biggest change has to be the next-generation Touch ID sensor built into the power button. Time will tell whether this is truly more convenient than having it in the &#8220;home&#8221; button, but it&#8217;s clear now that Apple has seen that demand for the fingerprint-based unlocking method has not abated.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2046764\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/touch-id-button.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2046764\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2046764\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/touch-id-button.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"711\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/touch-id-button.jpg 1362w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/touch-id-button.jpg?resize=150,104 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/touch-id-button.jpg?resize=300,208 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/touch-id-button.jpg?resize=768,533 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/touch-id-button.jpg?resize=680,472 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/touch-id-button.jpg?resize=50,35 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2046764\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Apple<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Could the new Touch ID power button show up on the iPhone 12, or at the very least on the iPad Pro later? It seems likely, as while Face ID has become more reliable over time, sometimes people just prefer the hands-on approach.<\/p>\n<p>The look is new to the iPad Air series, but mainly just resembles the Pro, with flat sides, rounded corners on the screen, and a prominent camera bump.

You probably won&#8217;t notice the difference unless they&#8217;re side by side, but Apple has always pushed to make sure its devices have among the highest-quality screens out there, and the new Air is no exception.<\/p>\n<p>The connector has graduated from Lightning to USB-C, like its big brother the iPad Pro, so while on one hand you might need to throw away your cables&#8230; again&#8230; the new cables aren&#8217;t special Apple ones sprinkled with fairy dust, so you&#8217;ll be able to use $5 ones from Monoprice instead.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s an improved front camera, and the back one gets the iPad Pro&#8217;s 12-megapixel, 4K-capable shooter. But no lidar, unfortunately. Speakers also get a boost, with stereo audio in landscape mode.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll be able to pick up the new iPad Air starting next month at $599 for the cheapest version (Wi-Fi only, with 64 GB of storage). It may be hard to justify spending the extra money for the Pro at this point. And of course if all you want is a basic iPad, Apple&#8217;s got you covered there too.<\/p>\n<p>The vanilla iPad, now in its eighth generation, also got a computing power bump to the A12 series of chips, but no real exterior changes. With 500 million iPad devices sold, the traditional (though considerably updated from the original) design has proven to be just fine.

everywhere in between. Public transportation is the same fragmented, disorganized ecosystem of millions of small-to-medium private enterprises throughout Africa.<\/p>\n<p>These public transport operators can be as small as a one-person outfit with a single van or bus up to a larger enterprise of several vehicles. There are no schedules or any coordination, and minibus operators will often wait until they can fill their vehicle with passengers. Meanwhile, the industry only accepts cash and without a means to monitor the number of trips and passengers, fraud and simple poor accounting is rampant.<\/p>\n<p>The upshot: public transportation is unreliable for commuters and unprofitable for the public transport operators. In this chaos, Ndhlovu and co-founder Bahlakoana Mabetha see opportunity.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Their Zimbabwe-based startup <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/tuverl\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tuverl\">Tuverl, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> which debuted Tuesday at TechCrunch Disrupt Startup Battlefield, is an app aimed at streamlining public transportation. Public operators pay Tuverl a fee to join. From here, operators can use the app to manage their fleets and locate vehicles as well as process fares. Commuters, meanwhile, can use the app to track intra-city buses and minibuses in real time, book trips, hail taxis on-demand and pay for their public transportation. Passengers can also rate and review their trips.<\/p>\n<p>The app was released as a beta version in the Google Play Store in February and has 30 public transport operators and 253 commuters. Tuverl plans to expand as COVID-19 lockdown measures ease.<\/p>\n<p>For now, Ndhlovu and Mabetha are focused on Zimbabwe. But the Harvard University grads have a grander vision for Tuverl.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;My motivation really was to try to improve public transportation for the ordinary person because it really makes a different in their lives,&#8221; Ndhlovu told me in a recent interview, adding that as a young student he was typically late for school because of inefficient public transport. &#8220;We need to build up operations in Zimbabwe and get some traction there. But we essentially want to make this an African thing. We want to be in every African country.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f611a94d7e1933299674322\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Africa may be a diverse continent overflowing with different cultures, languages and customs, but Tuverl co-founder and CEO Hope Ndhlovu says there is one experience \u2014 or industry \u2014 that is consistent from South Africa up to Egypt and everywhere in between.

announced a new feature that will allow families to stay better connected, even if some members of the family don&#8217;t have an iPhone. The company introduced a feature called Family Setup, available in watchOS 7, that allows a parent to pair their iPhone with a child&#8217;s Apple Watch in order to stay in touch, receive location notifications, use parental controls and more.<\/p>\n<p>With Family Setup, parents can set controls, like which contacts the child can communicate with over messages. It also allows family members to receive location alerts so parents will know where the child is and if they have entered or exited a geofenced area. For a child, this could be the school or a basketball practice, for example.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2046937\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2046937\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2046937\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-3.19.31-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"346\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-3.19.31-PM.jpg 767w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-3.19.31-PM.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-3.19.31-PM.jpg?resize=300,153 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-3.19.31-PM.jpg?resize=680,346 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-3.19.31-PM.jpg?resize=50,25 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2046937\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Apple<\/p><\/div><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>To some extent, that makes Family Setup a competitor to mobile family tracking apps, like Life360, which have become popular tools for families who keep track of one another&#8217;s location. (Or, as some would argue, apps for the helicopter parenting era of over-monitoring and surveillance.)<\/p>\n<p>But Apple&#8217;s advantage in this market is that it positions itself as a privacy-focused company. That means parents may feel like they can trust Apple to not store their family&#8217;s location data or sell it to third parties.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to location tracking, Family Setup lets parents configure downtime settings, to limit interactions and notifications on the paired watch while the child is focused on schoolwork, with a new &#8220;Schooltime&#8221; mode. Workout integration is available, as well, and offers an Activity Rings experience designed just for kids.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2046939\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2046939\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2046939\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-3.20.38-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"341\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-3.20.38-PM.jpg 773w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-3.20.38-PM.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-3.20.38-PM.jpg?resize=300,151 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-3.20.38-PM.jpg?resize=768,385 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-3.20.38-PM.jpg?resize=680,341 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-3.20.38-PM.jpg?resize=50,25 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2046939\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Apple<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, children can create their own Memoji with just their Apple Watch that they can use and send in stickers and messages, or use in the new watchOS 7 Memoji Watch Face.

href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/solosuit\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"solosuit\">SoloSuit <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> wants to help Americans who are being sued for a debt fight back using automated tools. The company, which is launching its service nationwide today at TechCrunch Disrupt Startup Battlefield, guides users through preparing a response to their lawsuit, optionally having a consumer protection attorney look over the entire document on their behalf, then handing the printing and court filing.<\/p>\n<p>The idea for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.solosuit.com\/\">SoloSuit<\/a> came from founder, George Simons, who had bought a lemon during his first year of law school and struggled to find an attorney who would help him out. That prompted the realization that there are likely millions of people across the U.S. who also can&#8217;t find attorneys to take cases for a variety of reasons. For example, they may struggle if there isn&#8217;t enough money in the case to make it worth an attorney&#8217;s while, or if the attorney they want is too busy to get on the phone, he suggests.<\/p>\n<p>The area of focus SoloSuit landed on, however, was debt lawsuits. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.consumerfinance.gov\/data-research\/research-reports\/consumer-experiences-debt-collection-findings-cfpbs-survey-consumer-views-debt\/\">Every year<\/a>, 10 million Americans get sued for debt and 9 million automatically lose because they aren&#8217;t able to figure out how to respond to those lawsuits, Simons claims. These debts could include medical debt, credit cards, auto loans, student loans, or any other unsecured debts. After a debt collector is unable to collect from the consumer, they may choose to sue for that debt instead.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>With the SoloSuit web app, users can respond to these lawsuits in about 15 minutes, the startup says.<\/p>\n<p>The way the process works is that when someone receives a complaint and summons in the mail, they&#8217;ll usually only have 14-30 days to respond, depending on the state, before they automatically lose their case. Often, customers will Google for information about what to do next, which is where they&#8217;ll find SoloSuit&#8217;s free online guides. These will also refer the potential customers to the web service. Here, the web app, which was demoed at Disrupt, will guide the customer through creating the response to the lawsuit and optionally pay to have an attorney review it.<\/p>\n<p>Customers can either pay $15 to have the response printed and filed on their behalf, or $115 to have an attorney review it before filing.<\/p>\n<p>The startup spun out of the Brigham Young University LawX legal design lab, where it was originally founded by a team of students. Simons ended up taking the reins and the other students have moved on. Currently, he is the sole founder but is expecting to hire a technical co-founder soon.<\/p>\n<p>Since SoloSuit&#8217;s founding a couple of years ago, it has seen 3,000 Utah-based customers who have been sued for a combined total of $11 million in debt lawsuits. The startup believes they&#8217;ve helped around 50% of those cases get dismissed.<\/p>\n<p>Today, the service will launch across all 50 U.S. states and will add the attorney review feature.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f61142d25d03b3821e76c61\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Online service SoloSuit wants to help Americans who are being sued for a debt fight back using automated tools.

class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> is introducing a brand new Apple Watch at a cheaper price point. The new Apple Watch SE features the same design as the newly announced <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/15\/this-is-the-apple-watch-series-6\/\">Apple Watch Series 6<\/a>, but it costs $279.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe second thing we&#8217;re doing to make Apple Watch available to even more people is to create a new model that combines elements of Series 6 design with the most essential features of Apple Watch, all at a more affordable price,\u201d Apple COO Jeff Williams said.<\/p>\n<p>The Apple Watch SE uses the S5 system-on-a-chip, which was first released for the Apple Watch Series 5. However, it has the same, big display as the one on the Series 6. It also has the same accelerometer, gyroscope, compass and altimeter as the ones in the Series 6.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>And because the Apple Watch SE shares the same design as the Apple Watch Series 6, you can use the most recent complications and watch faces that are going to be introduced with watchOS 7.<\/p>\n<p>So we\u2019ll have to look at the tech specs in detail after Apple&#8217;s event, because the Apple Watch SE looks like a good deal when you compare it with the Apple Watch Series 6 that costs $399. You might not get blood oxygen data like on the Series 6, but it\u2019s a good watch for users who just want a watch to track their workouts, for instance.<\/p>\n<p>Apple is still keeping the Apple Watch Series 3 at the same price ($199). This device is a few years old now and it features the older screen design. So the Apple Watch Series 3 is not compatible with the most recent watch faces and complications.<\/p>\n<p>The company is also positioning the Apple Watch SE as a way to offer an Apple Watch to your kid. There\u2019s a cellular model, which means you can communicate with your kid without handing them a smartphone.<\/p>\n<p>The Apple Watch SE will be available on Friday. Pre-orders start today.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2046681\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Apple-Watch-SE_lineup.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Apple-Watch-SE_lineup.jpg 1096w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Apple-Watch-SE_lineup.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Apple-Watch-SE_lineup.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Apple-Watch-SE_lineup.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Apple-Watch-SE_lineup.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Apple-Watch-SE_lineup.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"O2Z4VpWxOR\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/15\/this-is-the-apple-watch-series-6\/\">The Apple Watch Series 6 arrives Friday, priced at $399<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;The Apple Watch Series 6 arrives Friday, priced at $399&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/15\/this-is-the-apple-watch-series-6\/embed\/#?secret=O2Z4VpWxOR\" data-secret=\"O2Z4VpWxOR\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/Apple-Hardware-Event-2020\/\"><img src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/apple-hardware-event-2020.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In addition to keeping older-generation devices at an entry-level price, Apple is introducing a brand new Apple Watch at a cheaper price point.

A number of new watch faces have been adding, including new live Memojis and Pride stripes.<\/p>\n<p>The watch is powered by Apple&#8217;s new S6 silicon chip.

Here that means a new blue aluminum finish, graphite color and &#8212; for the first time &#8212; a Product Red edition. There&#8217;s a new take on the watch&#8217;s silicone band design, as well &#8212; the Solo Loop drops the standard band clasp.

option. However, most of us still don\u2019t know what an optimal business machine with remote operations looks like simply because reaching that point requires years of trying, testing and adapting.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One major thing we haven\u2019t all realized yet is that, without the visibility of face-to-face contact, data is essential in tracking employee progress and well-being, as well as the company\u2019s overall health.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And not just any data \u2014 granular (ideally automatic) data is needed to give us accurate insights and stop us from making burdensome mistakes, especially in tech companies where even more of the work effort is purely digital. Take productivity. If we were to focus on people\u2019s work hours alone, we\u2019d likely get the wrong picture. <a href=\"https:\/\/urldefense.com\/v3\/__https:\/\/medium.com\/coderbyte\/how-the-covid-19-pandemic-is-impacting-software-development-hiring-72243f41ac9e__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!VCHbfrrcSdu0OgFgBO8PHaSRs1ySk1_BhUAa4PpTxQFCN9CB0JI781IgbBsxy41H2CA3QUVA$\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/urldefense.com\/v3\/__https:\/\/medium.com\/coderbyte\/how-the-covid-19-pandemic-is-impacting-software-development-hiring-72243f41ac9e__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!VCHbfrrcSdu0OgFgBO8PHaSRs1ySk1_BhUAa4PpTxQFCN9CB0JI781IgbBsxy41H2CA3QUVA$&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1600196330139000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFF1ik03tN6zX_tJR4FW27mJgfAXQ\">Half of software developers<\/a> have been working more during quarantine. But what does this tell us about the toll this workload is taking on their mental health? Or the quality of their work, and how much extra time is going toward bringing their tasks up to scratch? Nothing at all.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Putting data at the core of project management is not about Big Brother; far from it. Data isn\u2019t inherently good or bad; it just gives you the tools to implement intelligent strategies and reduce errors. If anything, it will minimize the number of times you have to interfere with employees to ask for updates and micromanage.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Embracing data to create your new remote-ready project management strategy will enhance you and your team\u2019s work lives in the following ways.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Reduce wrong decisions<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Managers don\u2019t have accurate visibility into remote employees\u2019 productivity. Radio \u201csilence\u201d from team members can be misinterpreted to mean they\u2019re not working enough, especially independent workers like software engineers. You might think you wouldn\u2019t notice if they spent half their work hours on a coffee break, and your mind can run away with you. (The opposite \u2014 for those who talk too much \u2014 is also true).<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, a digital lifestyle produces digital indicators. Data-driven project management tools such as <a href=\"https:\/\/urldefense.com\/v3\/__https:\/\/www.wrike.com\/__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!VCHbfrrcSdu0OgFgBO8PHaSRs1ySk1_BhUAa4PpTxQFCN9CB0JI781IgbBsxy41H2AvdCyOt$\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/urldefense.com\/v3\/__https:\/\/www.wrike.com\/__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!VCHbfrrcSdu0OgFgBO8PHaSRs1ySk1_BhUAa4PpTxQFCN9CB0JI781IgbBsxy41H2AvdCyOt$&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1600196330139000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFIApPhVTIb6f-C7qxFjeuVu8nTAw\">Wrike<\/a> can tell you about employee output, but also about iterations and quality indicators on the same task.
